This talk will introduce the basic problems of Quantum Information Theory and outline some of the important theoretical results that have been achieved so far. We will discuss compression of classical and quantum information, channel capacities and communication protocols. An effort will be made to cover both topics of historical significance as well as currently active areas of research. No particular background is required  for this talk except for basic knowledge of linear algebra.

quantum info basics
"what are we talkin' bout"
	q mechanics == matrix mechanics
	qubit (physicist can tell you how diff to get |0> and |1> ONLY)
	mixed states
	operators
	entanglement
	

results in QIT
"we can do it quantum too"
	teleportation / s.d. coding

"other cool stuff"
	protocols family	
	quantum computing

computational ex:
	nansum(pw*log(pw))/sum(pwMAX*log(pwMAX))
	Out[89]: 0.72154429145989374
	nansum(pw*log(pw))
	Out[90]: -7.4451406072083923
	sum(pwMAX*log( pwMAX))
	Out[91]: -10.318341777945065
	log(len(d))
	Out[93]: 10.318341777940978
	
	so what is going on....
	if we had a bunch of symbols 
	we have  30283 words, all of them equally likely
	so we need symbols of length 
	10.318341777940978*30283

	not to be continued !
