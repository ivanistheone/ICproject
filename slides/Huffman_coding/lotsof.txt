We present a new theoretical method to study a trapped gas of bosonic two-level atoms interacting with a single mode of a microwave cavity. This interaction is described by a trilinear Hamiltonian which is formally completely equivalent to the one describing parametric down-conversion in quantum optics. A system of differential equations describing the evolution, including the long-time behaviour, of not only the mean value but also the variance of the number of excited atoms is derived and solved analytically. For different initial states the mean number of excited atoms exhibits periodically reappearing dips, with an accompanying peak in the variance, or fractional collapses and revivals. Closed expressions for the period and the revival time are obtained.

If the shape of the beam is appropriately chosen the induced dipole-potential can compensate for the difference between the trap potentials. Under these conditions the Hamiltonian in its second quantized form is given by H0 = d3 x

I. THE PHYSICAL SYSTEMS

Since the experimental realization of weakly interacting atomic Bose-Einstein condensates confined in magnetic traps [1] much work was done to study the interaction of such a system with light. Examples include the scattering of light by a condensate [2], its refraction index [3], nonlinear atom optics [4,5], the optical detection of the relative phase between two condensates [6], and the spontaneous emission in the presence of two condensates [7]. In this paper we are concerned with the question of how a condensate of two-level atoms interacts with a single resonant quantized cavity mode of the electromagnetic field. The system can be realized by placing the trap containing the condensate in a microwave cavity. We consider the limit of vanishing temperature so that essentially all atoms are in the condensate. The two states |g and |e are both members of the internal ground-state manifold of the condensed atoms but have a different hyperfine magnetic quantum number mF . For both states mF should be chosen in such a way that the atoms remain trapped after the transition from |g to |e . The internal energies corresponding to these states are denoted by Eg and Ee , respectively. Although for the existing condensates the trapping potential is different for states having a different magnetic quantum number we assume for simplicity that the trapping potential is the same for |g and 1

is the same for both internal states. M denotes the atomic mass, and  and z are the trap frequencies in the x - y plane and in the z-direction, respectively. The nonlinear Hamiltonian Hn.l. = 1 2 d3 x
i,j=e,g

gij  (x) (x)j (x)i (x) . (3) i j

describes the interaction between the atoms. The quantities gij are connected to the scattering lengths for the scattering between atoms in the internal states |i and |j . We will make the Hartree approximation and consider the case that all atoms are in the same state 0 (x) regarding the center-of-mass motion. This state fulfills the stationary nonlinear Schr¨dinger equation (see, e.g., o Ref. [8]) with energy eigenvalue µ and is the same for both internal states. We model the interaction of the atoms with the microwave photons by the usual magnetic dipole coupling Hint = -[aB + a B  ] · d3 x{mge  (x)g (x) + H.c.} e (4) where mge is the magnetic dipole moment of the atoms and B the magnetic field of the cavity mode at the position of the trap. As we consider the case that the trap size is much smaller than the wavelength of the

microwave photons the interaction does not affect the center-of-mass motion of the condensed atoms. This justifies the assumption that the atoms will always remain in the spatial mode 0 (x). Under these assumptions we can neglect all spatial modes beside 0 (x) and can replace the atomic field operators i (x) by 0 (x)bi (x), i = e, g, where the operators bi := d3 x (x)i (x) are the annihilation operators for 0 atoms in the internal state |i . Substituting this in the Hamiltonian (1) the latter can be simplified to H = (µ + Ee )b be + (µ + Eg )b bg + hc a a ¯ e g -[aB + a B  ] · {b be mge + bg b m } . g e ge (5)

In the interaction picture and after the rotating wave approximation the Hamiltonian reduces in resonance (¯ c = Ee - Eg ) to h ~ H = -¯ {b be a + bg b a} . h g e (6)

The Rabi frequency  is given by |mge · B  |/¯ . h The Hamiltonian (6) is formally equivalent to that used to describe parametric down conversion in nonlinear optics (see, e.g., Ref. [9]). In this system be destroys a photon of the pumping beam and a and b create a g signal and an idler photon, respectively. The interaction between the different modes is caused by a nonlinear medium and describes the process that a pumping photon is converted into two other photons under conservation of energy. Theoretically the pumping beam is often considered as a classical field. To be short we will focus in the following on the interpretation of the Hamiltonian (6) as an interaction between two-level atoms in a cavity. Though the physical interpretation is different our results can immediately be applied to parametric down conversion if one considers Ne = b be as the number operator e for pumping photons. A trilinear Hamiltonian has been examined numerically by Walls and Barakat [10]. Kumar and Mehta [11] derived analytical expressions for the time evolution under the condition that the number of one of the three particle species involved in Eq. (6) remains strongly populated. That the degenerate parametric oscillator may show collapse and revival has been predicted numerically by Jyotsna and Agarwal [12]. These results are similar to the numerical results of Drobn´ and Jex [13]. An exy act solution for a fixed number of atoms was given in a non-closed form by Tavis and Cummings [14].
II. COUPLED DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS FOR THE MEAN OCCUPATION NUMBER AND ITS VARIANCE

of the excited atomic mode for the case that initially all atoms are excited and there are zero photons in the cavity and to confront it with the time dependence of its variance. To do so we want to give closed-form approx¯ imate analytical solutions for Ne ( ) for different initial states of the condensate like atomic number state, coherent state, or mixture. This will allow us to demonstrate ¯ that Ne ( ) shows a periodic behaviour or the existence of collapse and revival, respectively. The Hamiltonian (6) leads to two conserved quantities: the total number of atoms SA := b be + b bg and, e g because of the rotating-wave approximation, the number of excitations SE := b be + a a. Because any two e of the number operators Ne , Ng , Na can be expressed by the third and the two conserved quantities, it suffices to solve the Heisenberg equation for only one of the three number operators. We will consider the number operator Ne of excited atoms. Introducing the new time variable  := t and considering the Heisenberg equation for Ne as well as for  Ne = -ib be a + ibg b a , g e (7)

where the derivative is taken with respect to  , one easily finds (see, e.g., Ref. [11])
2 ¨ Ne = 6Ne - 2ANe + 2B .

Our aim is to present a new analytical method for solving the underlying operator equations. In particular this will then enable us to describe for the system given above ¯ the long-time behaviour of the mean occupation Ne ( ) 2

For notational convenience we have introduced the operators A := 2SE + 2SA + 1 and B := SA SE . Note that while SA and SE commute with every operator oc curring in the problem, Ne does not commute with Ne . This fact seems to prevent the integration of the second order differential equation to an equation of first order as it is usually done with differential equations for ordinary functions. A common way to circumvent this difficulty is the vanishing variance approximation, where a differen¯ tial equation for Ne is derived under the assumption that ¯ the variance e defined by 2 := (Ne - Ne )2 is nege ligible. Here and in the following the mean value of an ¯ operator O will be represented by a bar, O := |O| . The complete state of the system is denoted by | . For the system under consideration this approximation was studied by Kumar and Mehta [11] starting from Eq. (8). They showed that it is valid for short times only and can be applied only to a very limited class of physical problems. Our objective is to improve this scheme: We want to go a step further and derive differential equations ¯ for the mean value Ne as well as for the variance e and study the respective long time behaviour for dif2 2 ferent states of the condensate. Because of  Ne = 2 ¨  ¨ Ne Ne + Ne Ne + 2Ne , the discussion of e ( ) needs the 2 knowledge of Ne and therefore the exact integration of the operator equation (8). This can indeed be done by  observing that the commutator between Ne and Ne is 2   ~ h  2 given by [Ne , Ne ] = H/(i¯ ) so that Ne Ne + Ne Ne = 3  (2/3)(dNe /d ) + (1/3)Ne follows, what can be used to integrate Eq. (8) to

Here C is a constant of motion which after some alge~ h bra can be written as C = -H 2 /(¯ 2 2 ) + 2SA SE . It is therefore related to the conservation of energy and particle numbers. Note that no approximation has been made up to this point. Although Eq. (9) cannot be exactly integrated because ¯ C does not commute with Ne , we are now able to treat Ne together with e if we make the two following assumptions of a vanishing asymmetry approximation: (i) the conserved particle numbers are always uncorrelated to l l the number of excited atoms so that Si Ne = Si Ne holds for i = A, E and any integer l. This equality is exactly fulfilled for all times if the initial state is an eigenstate of Si , e.g., a number state. (ii) we can always ne3 ¯ glect (Ne - Ne )3 so that Ne can be approximated by 3 2 ¯ ¯ Ne + 3Ne e . Accordingly, in contrast to the vanishing variance approximation, we only assume the vanishing ¯ of the higher moment (Ne - Ne )3 in the hierarchy of ¯e )m , m = 2, 3, . . . of the probability moments (Ne - N distribution. The case m = 3 describes its degree of asymmetry. Based on this we derive from Eqs. (8) and (9) the system of ordinary differential equations
2 ¯ ¯2 ¯¯ ¯  Ne = 6(2 + Ne ) - 2ANe + 2B , e 2 2 3 ¯e + 602 Ne - 8A(2 + Ne ) ¯ ¯ e ¯2  e = 20N e 2 ¯2 ¯ ¯ ¯ +4(1 + 3B)Ne + 2C -  Ne ,

The function cn(z|m) is one of the Jacobian elliptic functions, and K(m) is the complete elliptic integral [15]. If m is close to one cn(z|m) becomes almost identical to the expression 1/ cosh(z) except that cn2 (z|m) is periodic in z with period 2K(m)  ln[16/(1 - m)]. For a number ¯ ¯ ¯ state |n we have A = 4n + 1, B = n2 , and C = 2n2 - n. The corresponding solution (13) is, to the first two lead ing orders in n  1, characterized by   n + 2 and m  1-2/n. A second exact solution of Eq. (12) is structurally similar to that of Eq. (13) if cn(z|m) is replaced by the elliptic function dn(z|m). In this case the parameters are determined by different algebraic equations which we will omit in this paper.

We are now able to treat the envisaged physical situation: all atoms are initially for  = 0 excited and no photons are present. It is desirable to obtain the devel¯ opment in time of Ne ( ) for the case of the atomic state being a number state with n atoms, the corresponding complete state of the system being denoted by |n . We ¯ will demonstrate below that Ne ( ) for other physical situations can be reduced to this. The operator equations (8) ¯ and (9) show that the initial conditions for Ne ( ) which ¯ are to be fulfilled for a number state are: Ne (0) = n, ¯ ¯ ¯e (0) =  3 Ne (0) = 0, and  2 Ne (0) = -2n.  N   We have in fact been able to find an exact solution of Eq. (12) fulfilling the correct number state initial condi3 ¯ ¯ ¯ tions for Ne (0),  Ne (0),  Ne (0), and, to leading order 2 ¯ in n, for  Ne (0). It is given by 3

¯ num Our improved mean value solution Ne ( ) of Eq. (13) is plotted in Fig. 1 together with the ordinary mean value solution obtained in the vanishing variance approximation (e = 0). As one can see, the fluctuations become very large when the dip in the number of excited atoms occurs. As compared with the vanishing-variance approximation the dip is reduced by a factor of 1/2. This is in qualitative agreement with the results of Ref. [16] where a similar physical system was examined under the assumption that the photons escape quickly so that the

number of excitations is not conserved. Note that the frequency of the occurrence of the dip is modified, too. The  period Tp is determined by n + 2Tp = 2K(1 - 2/n)  leading to Tp = ln(8n)/[ n + 2]. It diminishes with increasing number of atoms.
IV. COLLAPSE AND REVIVAL

Based on the solution (13) we are now able to calculate the mean number of excited atoms if initially no photons and only excited atoms are present which form a coherent state with mean number n of atoms. We ex¯ pand this state in the number states |l . Since each ~ h of the states Ne (0) exp[-iHt/¯ ]|l is an eigenstate of SA with eigenvalue l they are orthogonal for different l. This reduces the mean value of Ne to the expression
 n ¯ coh Ne ( ) = e-¯ l=0

(14)

can at all be described by a coherent state (compare, e.g., Ref. [17]) an experimental verification of collapse and revival cannot be used to discriminate between coherent state and mixture. We turn to the details of the time development of ¯ coh Ne ( ). The time TR when the first (large) revival occurs can be determined by the criterion given in Ref. [18]: the expression l |Ne ( )|l must simultaneously have a maximum for the two neighboring values l = n and ¯ l = n + 1. This guarantees that many terms in the ¯ sum in Eq. (14) become simultaneously large. Since cn(z|m) is periodic this condition becomes a condition on the argument of the Jacobian elliptic function, namely   nTR - K(1 - 2/¯ ) = 2rK(1 - 2/¯ ) and n + 1TR - ¯ n n ¯ K(1 - 2/(¯ + 1)) = 2(r + 1)K(1 - 2/(¯ + 1)) with an n n integer r. This can be solved for r and TR and results to leading order in n in ¯  2 n ln2 (8¯ ) n ¯ TR  . (15)  ln(8¯ ) - 2 n According to its derivation the revival time TR is independent of the probability weights of the mixture or state when it is expanded in |l . It is therefore the same for all mixtures with the same initial mean number of excited atoms. In addition to the large revival at time TR there are many smaller revivals at earlier times which arise at fractions of TR (see Fig. 3). These fractional revivals have been predicted numerically for the degenerate parametric oscillator in Refs. [12,13]. The fractional revivals arise when only a part of the sum terms in Eq. (14) have simultaneously a maximum. Their revival times can be calculated by assuming that the terms for l = n and ¯ l = n + r, r = 2, 3, . . . are simultaneously maximal. This ¯ leads to TR (r) = TR (1)/r. Since the revivals reappear periodically one generally finds them at fractions of small integers of the time TR .

Because the r.h.s. is only a function of the mean values ¯ num Ne ( ) of the number state case, it may directly be evaluated with the help of Eq. (13). The physical reason for this simplification is that the interaction conserves the total number of atoms. Thus, no interferences between number states of different total atom number can occur. Note that the expression (14) is identical to the mean value for a statistical mixture of number states with Poissonian statistics.

¯ num Whereas Ne ( ) for a number state shows a periodic behaviour with period Tp it is an important consequence of Eq. (14) that a coherent atomic state as initial state ¯ coh leads to collapse and revival in the number Ne ( ) of excited atoms (see Fig. 2). This is also the case for a statistical mixture. Leaving open the question if a condensate 4

FIG. 3. Between the collapse and the main revival fractional revivals do appear.

¯ An estimation of the almost constant value Nconst ¯ coh ( ) between the collapse and the first retaken by Ne vival can be derived under the assumption that the arguments of cn(z|m) of Eq. (13) that appear in the sum in Eq. (14) are statistically distributed over the whole period of cn(z|m) (i.e., z  [0, 2K(m)]). Nconst then is simply the average of Eq. (13) over one period Tp . The corre2K sponding integration (2K)-1 0 cn2 (z|m)dz can be performed if cn2 (z|m  1) is approximated by 1/ cosh2 (z) and results to leading order in n in ¯ ¯ Nconst  n 1 - ¯ 1 ln(8¯ ) n . (16)

The two analytical expressions for TR and Nconst are in good agreement with the numerical evaluation of Eq. (14). In conclusion we have presented analytical results for the collapse and revival of the mean occupation number and the variance of excited atoms in a microwave cavity. The phenomenon of a revival in the context of Bose-Einstein condensation was also examined for different physical systems. Zhang and Walls [19] discovered it numerically for atoms passing through a standing light wave. Wright et al. [20] showed that it occurs if the Bose condensate is described by a superposition of states with different total number of atoms. Our results differ from these approaches in that a third mode (the microwave photons) is fully incorporated and that the new theoretical method applied here allows to derive closed expressions for the interesting physical quantities.

Preparation of Nonclassical States in Cavities with a Moving Mirror
S. Bose, K. Jacobs and P. L. Knight
Optics Section, The Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, England We describe how a quantum system composed of a cavity field interacting with a movable mirror can be utilized to generate a large variety of nonclassical states of both the cavity field and the mirror. First we consider state preparation of the cavity field. The system dynamics will prepare a single mode of the cavity field in a multicomponent Schr¨dinger cat state, in a similar manner to o that in a Kerr medium. In addition, when two or more cavity modes interact with the mirror, they may be prepared in an entangled state which may be regarded as a multimode generalisation of even and odd coherent states. We show also that near-number states of a single mode may be prepared by performing a measurement of the position of the mirror. Secondly we consider state preparation of the mirror, and show that this macroscopic object may be placed in a Scr¨dinger cat state by a o quadrature measurement of the light field. In addition we examine the effect of the damping of the motion of the mirror on the field states inside the cavity, and compare this with the effect of cavity field damping. 42.50.Dv,03.65.Bz I. INTRODUCTION

arXiv:quant-ph/9708002v1 1 Aug 1997

Recently, Mancini et.al. [1] have shown how a cavity with a movable mirror (treated as a quantum harmonic oscillator) can be used to synthesize Schr¨dinger o cat states [2,3] of the cavity field. In fact, as we will see here, this system can lead to the production of an extensive class of novel states of the cavity field, including entangled states of two or more cavity modes. One of the aims of this paper is to describe how these can be achieved. Furthermore, in Ref. [1] only the effect of photon leakage from the cavity was considered as a relevant source of decoherence. We examine the opposite extreme, namely when the decoherence induced in the field due to the damping of the mirror's motion is the dominant source of decoherence and photon leakage is almost absent. We calculate the effect of this type of decoherence on the states of the cavity field and explicitly demonstrate that, due to the oscillatory nature of the system, the decoherence rate is much lower than expected. Moreover, we show that apart from trying to improve the mirror's isolation, increasing its frequency also helps to reduce the rate of the type of decoherence considered here. This fact comes as a benefit in the generation of atleast one type of nonclassical state of the cavity field. These results definitely brighten the prospects of observing nonclassical states of the field inside the cavity given that damping of the mirror's motion is inevitable. It is also shown that even when the effect of mirror damping on the cavity field is dominant, it does not destroy all the nonclassical features of the cavity field. In Ref. [1], the main focus was the generation of nonclassical states of the cavity field. We give here a thorough treatment of the quantum dynamics of the mirror

as well. In particular, we point out ways in which this mirror motion can also be put in a nonclassical state. Of course, if these are to be observed, then very good isolation of our system from the environment is necessary. However, the very fact that this system allows in principle the production of nonclassical states of a macroscopic object such as the mirror (after sufficient isolation) should be interesting in itself.

II. DYNAMICS OF THE UNDAMPED SYSTEM

Numerous authors have previously treated the system of a cavity field and a movable mirror, both quantum mechanically [1,4] and classically [5,6], and both theoretically [1,4,5] and experimentally [6,7]. We here assume the movable mirror to be a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency m and annihilation operator denoted by b, interacting with a cavity field mode of frequency 0 and annihilation operator denoted by a. The relevant Hamiltonian [1] is H = h0 a a + hm b b - ¯ g a a(b + b ) ¯ ¯ h where g = 0 L h ¯ , 2mm (2) (1)

and L and m are the length of the cavity and mass of the movable mirror respectively. The time evolution operator corresponding to the above Hamiltonian was evaluated by Mancini et al. [1] (for completeness we give a proof in Appendix A) and is given by (3)

U (t) = exp -ira a t exp ik 2 (a a)2 (t - sin t) exp ka a(b -   b) exp -ib bt , 1

where  = (1 - e-it ), k = g/m is the scaled coupling parameter, r = 0 /m , and t represents a scaled time, being the actual time multiplied by m . We note that values for k of the order of unity are experimentaly feasible (0  1016 s-1 , m  1 Khz, L  1 m, m  10 mg) [1,5,6]. We see from the above equation that there is now an explicit Kerr-like term in U (t), so that physically one might expect the cavity field to have an evolution similar to that in a Kerr like nonlinearity. In view of the large variety of nonclassical states that can be produced by a Kerr medium [8­10], this system clearly offers prospects for the production of nonclassical states of light [1,7]. Indeed, it is known that, like the Kerr nonlinearity, this system of a moving-mirror cavity also exhibits optical bistability [5,6]. Let us assume that initially both the mirror and the cavity field are in coherent states. To see that this is reasonable we first note that the long-time steady state of the cavity mode is the vacuum, and that the most stable pointer state [11] for the mirror (being a single harmonic oscillator) is a coherent state [12]. The steady state therefore consists of the cavity mode in the vacuum state and the mirror in a coherent state. The cavity mode can now be placed in a non-vacuum coherent state by driving it with a coherent input field on a time-scale which is much shorter than the time-scale of the mirror motion. Thus we write the initial state at time t = 0 as |(0) = |
c

The time evolution of the system in the interaction picture (that is, omitting the free evolution of the field) leads to a state at time t given by

Two features of the mirror dynamics emerge from the above equations: (1) After a time t = 2 the mirror returns to its original state. At all times between t = 0 and t = 2 the mirror state is entangled with the field state with the entanglement being maximum when t = . The time dependence of the entanglement is shown in Fig.(1) as a plot of the purity, or "linear entropy" [13] which is given by (1 - T r(M (t)2 )) where M (t) is the reduced density matrix of the mirror. (2) The mirror, always being in a mixture of coherent states during its evolution, is described by entirely positive Wigner functions and therefore has a fully classical dynamics as illustrated in Fig.(2). In this figure, and all the figures showing the Wigner function of the mirror, x shall stand for b + b and y for -i(b - b ). The mirror undergoes an oscillation of a different amplitude (but at the same frequency) for each number state of the field. The net effect is a kind of breathing of the mirror state; the mirror state undergoes an oscillatory increase and decrease of its position and momentum spread. However, this is very different from the well known breathing of squeezed states, as the mirror state is a mixture of coherent states.

Thus, during undamped evolution, no nonclassical state of the mirror is generated. However, because of the entanglement of the mirror with the field, it is possible to generate nonclassical states of the mirror by performing conditional measurements on the field. We discuss this in section IV.

We divide the discussion of the generation of nonclassical states of the cavity field into three categories: (A) Multicomponent cats generated at t = 2 due to dynamics alone (i.e without any external intervention). Among these, a method of generating the 2-component Schr¨dinger cat has been discussed in Ref. [1]. (B) Eno tangled states of two or more light modes generated at t = 2 due to the dynamics alone. (C) Nonclassical states produced due to conditional measurements on the mirror. Of course the discussion here is by no means exhaustive and there remains the possibility of generating even more interesting states.

which is a four component cat (not normalized). Thus by adjusting the ratio of the coupling and the mirror frequency and thereby varying k one can, in principle, obtain all these types of cats at time t = 2. The Wigner functions of the cats produced by different values of k are shown below in Fig.(3). In this figure and all figures showing the Wigner function of the cavity field x = a+a and y = -i(a - a) are dimensionless quantities. Exactly the same type of states have been noted before as arising in the Kerr medium [8­10]. It is indeed worth noting that creating such states in a cavity such as ours has intrinsic advantages because there is an extensive set of tomographic methods [14­20] that can be implemented to reconstruct the Wigner function in a cavity.

Two modes of light, each separately interacting with the movable mirror, and with no direct coupling between them, can end up being in an entangled state at time t = 2 depending on the value of the parameter k. Let there be two different modes of light inside the cavity at t = 0. For simplicity we assume them to have the same frequency and hence same value of the parameter k, but mutually orthogonal polarization directions. We assume them to be initially fully disentangled and prepared in coherent states. Let the initial state of the composite system of the mirror and the light be

(14)

As is evident from the above equation, |(m, k) c2 are states of the same type as the state | c given by Eq.(7) 2 with an amplitude 1 eik 4m . Hence, for certain values   of k (such as 0.5 or 1/( 6) or 1/(2 2)), number states of one mode become correlated with multicomponent cat states of the other mode. However, if k is such that (2k 2 nm) is an integer for all n and m, then the state |(m, k) c2 becomes independent of m and |E becomes a disentangled state. Some simplification of Eq.(14) for k=0.5 results in the entangled state


Note that production of entangled states in a Kerr medium, when the two modes of light have a direct interaction between them have been discussed before [21]; however this case is different in the sense that the modes become entangled because they both individually interact with the same movable mirror. There is no restriction on the number of modes that can be entangled using the above procedure (only each mode to be entangled has to be resonant with the cavity). It is interesting to demonstrate how eigenstates of the operator (ac1 ac2 ...acN )p where ac1 , ac2 , ..., acN are annihilation operators of N different modes of light and p is an integer can be created in the cavity. As it is possible for resonant modes to have frequencies that are integer multiples of each other, let us consider the case when there are N different modes of light in the cavity, with their frequencies c1 , c2 , ...., cN being related by cj = j c1 where j are integers. Then from Eq.(2) it follows that the value of their k parameters will be related by kj = j k1 . Hence if the initial state of the cavity modes and the mirror is |(0) = |1

As the term ei2k1 (1 n1 +2 n2 +...+N nN ) cannot be split up into a product of the form f1 (n1 )f2 (n2 )...fN (nN ), for arbitrary values of k1 , |EN can, in general, be an entangled state depending on the value of k1 . Now consider the case when 2k1 2 = /p. We have

2

(19)

Hence |EN are eigenstates of the operator (ac1 ac2 ...acN )p , generalizations of the well known even and odd coherent states which are eigenstates of squares of annihilation operators [2].
C. Nonclassical states produced by conditional measurements on the mirror

Because of the entanglement of the mirror state with the state of the cavity field during evolution, any measurement on the mirror will project the cavity field to some state which we can determine. We consider here measurements of the mirror's position, x = b + b (i.e, x represents actual position of the mirror multiplied by 5

h ( 2mm /¯ ), m being the mass of the mirror), at time t = , as the entanglement is most pronounced at that time. Such a measurement will project the state of the light to

|(x)

c

=N

2 2 n  eik n x|n () |n c . n! n=0



(20)

Thus for different values of the mirror position x, different states of the cavity field are produced. Let us choose parameters k = 1,  = 2 and  = 2. Then the peak of the gaussian function x|n () lies at xn = 4n - 4 and its width is  = 1. Thus the distance between the peaks of x|n () and x|n+1 () , that is, xn - xn+1 = 4 , is greater than the width .Hence, if the value obtained for x obtained as a result of the measurement is near xn , the most dominant constituent of the state |(x) c is |n c . In this way, we may expect to produce nonclassical states which are very close to number states. For example, if the value obtained for x is near 0 (which is near x1 ) the cavity field is projected to the state (unnormalized) |(0)  e

which is shown in Fig.(4a). Similarly when x is near x5  16, we get a state very close to the number state |5 as shown in Fig.(4b). When x is inbetween xn and xn+1 we get essentially a superposition of states |n and |n+1 as illustrated in Fig.(4c) for n = 2 (the state in the fig ure is approximately -2|1 c + 2 2|2 c , not normalized). Fock state superpositions and their nonclassical properties have been discussed in [22].

FIG. 4. The Wigner functions of the state to which the cavity field is projected for various results, x, of a measurement of the position of the mirror. We have taken the initial coherent state amplitude of the cavity mode to be  = 2, and that of the mirror to be  = 2. The scaled coupling parameter is k = 1, and the measurment is made at time t = .

It is evident from the above discussion that the generation of the above type of states solely rely on the narrowness of the coherent state width in comparison to the spatial separation between the peaks of the gaussians x|n () and x|n+1 () . As this spatial separation can always be increased by increasing the value of the parameter k, the proximity of the states produced to Fock states and their superpositions can always be improved. We note that the first two types of states, that is, the cats and the entangled states, rely on the Kerr type term in the time evolution and hence they can be generated in a Kerr medium as well. In particular, generation of cat states in a Kerr medium was suggested some time ago [8,9]. However, the generation of the third type of states (i.e the number states and their superpositions) do not appear to have an analogue in the Kerr medium because they are entirely dependent on the entanglement of the states of the mirror and the cavity field during evolution.

IV. GENERATION OF NONCLASSICAL STATES OF THE MIRROR FROM CONDITIONAL MEASUREMENTS

The system also offers the opportunity to create quite different nonclassical states of the mirror by conditional measurements on the x quadrature of the light field. As the spatial separation between the coherent state components of the mirror is maximum at t = , measurements at this instant are likely to produce the most nonclassical states of the mirror. A measurement of the x quadrature 6

m.

(22)

As the |n () m are coherent states with a different amplitude for each value of n, |(x) m is a superposition of spatially separated coherent states and as such an entirely nonclassical state of the mirror. Moreover, as the parameter k is increased, the separation between the coherent components |n () m increases. So by varying k, one can control the macroscopic distinguishability of the states involved in the superposition. In Fig.(5) we have plotted the Wigner function for the state of the mirror produced when k = 1 and the measurement result is x = 0. This state is distinctly nonclassical and looks somewhat like a Schr¨dinger cat state with unequal amounts of each o coherent component.

described in this section offers a possible direction from which the production of nonclassical states of a macroscopic object may be approached. Obviously, these states will decohere very rapidly, and their realization may enable some tests of decoherence models [27]. The three main issues which will need to be addressed to bring this scheme to a practical level are: (1) How well isolated the movable mirror can be made , (2) how to perform tomography of the states produced and (3) how to perform instantaneous measurements of the x quadrature of the field inside the cavity. We leave the treatment of these issues for the future.

FIG. 5. The Wigner function of the state to which the mirror is projected when a measurement of the x quadrature of the cavity field at time t =  gives a value 0. We have taken the initial coherent state amplitude of the cavity mode to be  = 0.8, and that of the mirror to be  = 2.The scaled coupling parameter is k = 1. The quadratures x and y and the Wigner function W (x, y) are given here in dimensionless form.

The importance of the above procedure stems from the observation that there is already a considerable amount of literature, both theoretical [23] and experimental [3,24], focussed on methods to prepare atoms in nonclassical motional states. So it is only natural to expect that placing a more massive object in such states should be an issue of serious consideration. The ability to place macroscopic objects in non-classical states may even posses applications. Hollenhorst, for example, has shown that placing gravitational wave detectors in squeezed states leads to higher sensitivity [25]. Allthough schemes relying on momentum transer to a massive object from several microscopic objects (such as atoms or neutrons) have been suggested [26], these are definitely difficult to implement experimentally. Thus the scheme 7

In Ref. [1], the decoherence of the cavity field was treated as entirely due to the leaking of light through the cavity mirrors. Here, we investigate the complementary case i.e. when the photon leakage from the cavity is almost absent, but damping of the mirror's motion is significant. It is somewhat artificial to assume no leakage of light from the cavity, but in principle the rate of mirror damping can be made a few orders of magnitude more than the rate of damping due to the leakage of light by choosing mirrors of sufficiently high reflectivity. We do not try to address issues of practical feasibility in this paper, however. As the state of the cavity field is entangled with the state of the mirror at times between 0 and 2, it is expected that the decoherence of the mirror will induce a decoherence of the cavity field. However, its effect on the state of the cavity field is expected to be nontrivial. During the standard decoherence due to leaking of light from the cavity, the coherent states of light form the relevant pointer basis [11]. However, in the case considered here, coherent states of the mirror are in one to one correspondence with number states of the cavity field. So if decoherence of the mirror forces it towards a coherent state basis, it will induce a decoherence of the cavity field towards the number state basis. This decoherence will leave some imprint on the state produced in the cavity at time t = 2. The equation which governs the decoherence of the mirror depends on the way the mirror is coupled to its environment. Here, for simplicity, we assume that the mirror is amplitude coupled to the environment at zero temperature, which implies the master equation [28] d(t) i  = - [H, (t)] + (2b(t)b - b b(t) - (t)b b) dt h ¯ 2 (23) where H is the Hamiltonian of Eq.(1). Since we are using a scaled time t,  in the above equation is the usual damping constant (that is, the reciprocal of the dissipation

W(x,y)

timescale) divided by the mirror frequency m . Eq.(23) has the feature that it singles out coherent states as the pointer basis [11]. It is expected that natural decoherence of macroscopic objects should force them towards a coherent state basis (to conform with classical reality), and Eq.(23) accomplishes exactly this. So we expect that the solution of Eq.23 will atleast give the basic features of the effect of mirror decoherence on the cavity states correctly. A similar justification has been given for the use of the above type of decoherence in modelling quantum measurement in Ref. [29]. A more appropriate model for the decoherence of the mirror is quantum Brownian motion [27], but it is also more difficult to solve for our system of interest. Work is in progress to solve the quantum Brownian motion for our system numerically, while

here we present the analytic solution for the evolution of our system when decoherence is described according to Eq.(23). This solution is expected to have most features (at least the localization of the cavity field towards a number state basis) similar to the solution in the case of quantum Brownian motion because both drive the mirror state to a mixture of coherent states. The technique we use to solve Eq.(23) is to apply the unitary evolution and the nonunitary (decohering) evolution alternately for short instants of time t, and then take the limit as t  0. For simplicity, we assume the initial coherent state of the mirror to be the vacuum state. The solution for this initial condition is evaluated in Appendix B, and the result is

In other words, the solution given by Eq.(24) reduces to the undamped solution given by Eq.(5). The fact that the mirror is in a mixed state and does not return to a pure state at t = 2 as in the undamped case is illustrated in Fig.(6) in a plot of the linear entropy of the mirror's state versus time.

(1) Note that from Fig.7(a), it is evident that even for a value of scaled  as high as 0.001 (that is, unscaled  of 1), we have almost no decoherence of the Schr¨dinger cat o at all. Thus, unless the mirror is quite heavily damped it has almost no effect on the states produced inside the cavity. A possible cause for this is that the efficiency of decoherence depends on the separation between the coherent states of the mirror corresponding to different number states of the field. This separation is not constant, but oscillates between zero and a maximum value of 2k(n - m). The decoherence process, does not, therefore, get the chance to act with as much efficiency as it would have if the mirror was not a harmonic oscillator. Speaking more mathematically, Eq.(26) implies that D(n, m, , t) is proportional to k 2  and not just . As increasing the frequency decreases k, it also decreases the rate of decoherence even if  (which relates to the isolation of the system) is held constant. In terms of the absolute time  (obtained by dividing the scaled time t, which we had been using, by m ), the time scale d of decoherence depends on the frequency as (from Eqs.(2), (26) and definition of k) d  (m )3 (27)

Thus controlling m offers an alternate way to control the decoherence timescale of our system. It is worthwhile to mention that an analogous situation has been pointed out in Ref. [30] in the context of the Jaynes Cummings model, where atomic spontaneous emmission has a much weaker effect on revivals of atomic inversion than the cavity field damping. In that case, however, the explanation was quite different, namely, that spontaneous emmission is independent of 9

the cavity field intensity, while cavity damping is intensity dependent. This logic will also apply to our system when the intensity of the cavity field is large. The term which causes decoherence, D(n, m, ), is completely independent of the intensity of the cavity field. So as this intensity increases, the photon damping begins to dominate over the mirror's motional damping, as far as influencing the final state in the cavity is concerned. (2) The interference peak of the Schr¨dinger cat, which o is a primary feature of this cat, is not significantly lowered by the decoherence process (See Figs.7(b)-7(d)), allthough there is a phase diffusion of the state. The reasoning for this is the simple fact that the decoherence is towards the number state basis, which preserves the photon number distribution. The photon number distribution at t = 2 is same for both the decohered state given by Eq.(24) and the undecohered state given by Eq.(5). This means that one of the primary signatures of the Schr¨dinger cat, namely, an oscillating phoo ton number distribution (that is, the probability of odd photon numbers being zero for an even coherent state and vice versa) is the same for the final state produced at t = 2, irrespective of whether there was decoherence or not. So the decoherence considered here is not acting to eliminate all nonclassical properties of the field that would be produced without decoherence. It does destroy the phase information, but maintains the nonclassicality of the number distribution. This is precisely the reason why the interference peak of the Schr¨dinger cat does not o appear to be destroyed even when scaled  is as high as unity, as depicted in Fig.7(d). So far we have only considered how the generation of the Schr¨dinger cat is affected in the presence of the miro ror's motional damping. Let us now briefly pause to consider how the generation of the other nonclassical states of the cavity field may be affected. The entangled states of two or more cavity modes mentioned in Section.III B are generated by a procedure identical to the generation of the multicomponent cats and hence should have similar patterns of decoherence. On the other hand, the Fock states mentioned in Section.III C will not atall be affected by the type of decoherence considered here, as it drives the cavity field towards a mixture of Fock states. Moreover, even after their production they will be very stable because, neither the Hamiltonian evolution, nor the decohering evolution destroys a Fock state of the cavity field. Ofcourse one will have to remember that in a realistic case the photon leakage will also be present, which does destroy Fock states [8,9]. Lastly, comes the superpositions of two successive Fock states, also described in Section.III C. These will, ofcourse, be seriously affected as the decoherence process will be destroying the coherence between successive Fock states. As the generation of the nonclassical states of the mirror depend crucially on the coherence between the different |n c  |n (t) m components of the system's state, it will also be affected. In fact, at the very instant of generation of a nonclassical state of the mirror of the type given by Eq.(22), 10

the coherence between any two of its components like |n () m and |m () m , will be e-D(n,m,,) of the undamped value. We have already mentioned that the decoherence timescale of the system may be increased by increasing the frequency of the mirror. But whether that actually helps in the generation of any of the nonclassical states described in this paper requires further scrutiny. For example, the multicomponent cats are generated only when k 2 t reaches a certain value. But D(n, m, , t) depends precisely on k 2 t and not simply on time. Thus increasing the frequency will ofcourse increase the decoherence timescale, but also increase the timescale for the production of the cat states proportionately, so that they are decohered by the same amount whenever they are produced. For the nonclassical states of the mirror described by Eq.(22), the situation is somewhat better, but not without its problems. By decreasing k (through m ), one not only decreases the rate of decoherence but also decreases the spatial separation between the coherent state components involved in the superposition. Hence the components in the superposition may become more coherent, but they also become less macroscopically distinguishable . However, in the generation of the superposition of two successive Fock states, decreasing m really does help. The reason is clear from Eq.(20). The components of the superposition are Fock states of the cavity field and thereby do not depend in any way on the parameter k. The only contribution of k comes in the amplitudes, and two successive Fock states can always be made to have significant amplitudes whenever the measurement outcome x is about halfway between the peaks of the gaussians x|n () and x|n+1 () , irrespective of the value of k. Thus there is atleast one type of nonclassical state whose generation can be aided by increasing the mirror frequency.

VI. CONCLUSION

In conclusion we would like to stress that the work presented here offers new prospects for the observation of nonclassical features of light in the cavity. Even when the decoherence due to the mirror's motion is maximum, the nonclassicality associated with the photon number distribution in the cavity is preserved. However, nonclassicality associated with the phase distribution is hindered. But here also, one can be optimistic from the viewpoint that the effect is not dominant unless the mirror is very heavily damped. We have not addressed the problem of detecting the states produced in the cavity because there exists an extensive literature on this topic [14­20]. The primary aim of further work must be to solve the system when the mirror is damped according to quantum Brownian motion models [11,31] so that one can set up explicit limits on the parameters such as the temperature and mass of the mirror required to observe the

nonclassical states in the cavity in their most undecohered condition. Nevertheless, we expect that the feature of decoherence of the field towards the number state basis should also be present in that full solution, since any physically sensible decoherence model must tend to localize the mirror state towards the coherent state basis. In addition there are prospects to utilize the system for tests of quantum Brownian motion, which can be explored further. Also, we have considered starting initially with only a coherent state inside the cavity. One might be able to produce more interesting nonclassical states by starting with nonclassical states. In fact, all that can be investigated in the Kerr medium can be done with this system. Even more can be done with the mirror sys-

tem perhaps becuase of the opportunities of conditional measurements.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF THE TIME EVOLUTION OPERATOR FOR THE UNDAMPED SYSTEM

swap the last two exponential factors in this expression. To acheive this we note first that the BCH expansion gives e-ib b [a a(b - b)]eib
 

The time evolution operator is given by U (t) = e-ira a e-itb

b+ikta a(b+b )





= a a(b e-it - beit ),

(A9)

(A1)

and again using Eq.(A6) we obtain e-ib b e-ka
 

where t is the time multiplied by m , k = g/m and r = 0 /m . We now consider a unitary transformation using the operator T =e

(A2)

Multiplying both sides on the right by e-ib b we arive at the relation required to swap the exponentials, namely e-ib b e-ka
 



Note that this is a displacement operator for the mirror in which the displacement amplitude has been replaced by the number operator for the cavity mode. Using the Baker-Cambell-Hausdorf expansion [32], the effect of this transformation is readily shown to be T bT  = b + ka a, T b T  = b + ka a, T a aT  = a a. Using the fact that U f ({Xi })U  = f ({U Xi U  }), (A6) (A3) (A4) (A5)

a(b -b)

We may now write the expression for U (t) as U (t) = e-ira ×e

and to obtain the final expression given in Eq.(3), we need only combine the arguments of the 3rd and 4th exponentials, which is readily acheived with the BCH relation [32].

for any function f , unitary operator U , and arbitrary set of operators {Xi }, the effect of the transformation on the time evolution operator is easily calculated to be T U (t)T  = e-ira

APPENDIX B: SOLUTION TO THE MASTER EQUATION FOR THE SYSTEM WHEN THE MIRROR'S MOTION IS DAMPED

Multiplying on the left by T , and on the right by T , we obtain the following expression for the time evolution operator: U (t) = e-ira




We need to solve Eq.(23), which contains two parts. The solution of the first part d(t) i = - [H, (t)] , dt h ¯ is known to be (t) = U (t)(0)U  (t) 11 (B2) (B1)

(A8) (Note that to obtain this expression we have swapped various exponentials which contain commuting arguments.) To obtain the final form of U (t), we need to

where, U (t) is given by Eq.(3). On the other hand, the second part,  d(t) = (2b(t)b - b b(t) - (t)b b) dt 2 is known to transform |i j | as [29] Pij |i j |  Pij i |j
(1-e-t )

n (, t)  n (, t)(1 - t/2).

(B8)

Hence we can set up the following differential equation (B3) dn (, t)  = -in (, t) + ikn - n (, t), dt 2 (B9)

|i e-t/2 j e-t/2 | (B4)

the solution for which (with initial condition n (, 0) = 0) is given by n (, t) = ikn (1 - e-(i+/2)t ). i + /2 (B10)

where, |i and |j are coherent states. Let the initial state of our system be (0) = | |c  |0 0|m , (B5)

Next let us determine how nm (t) evolves. Following Eq.(B2) it evolves as nm (t)  nm (t) eik while Eq.(B3) transforms nm (t)  nm (t) n (, t)|m (, t) = nm (t)e-|n (,t)-m (,t)|
(1-e-t ) t/2

that is, we assume the mirror to be in a vacuum state initially (for simplicity). As the damping localizes the mirror state to a coherent state basis, and corresponding to each number state of the field, the mirror is driven to a separate coherent state, at any time t the general form of the density matrix will be (t) =
n=0,m=0

nm (t)|n m|c  |n (, t) m (, t)|m . (B6)

(B12)

Thus, we can split the evolution of the entire system into separate evolutions labelled by m and n. In other words, we break our problem into that of calculating the evolution of each of the entities nm (t) |n (, t) m (, t)|m separately. In any small time step t during which evolution occurs only according to Eq.(B2), the amplitudes of the coherent states of the mirror change according to n (, t)  (1 - it)n (, t) + iknt, (B7)

where the smallness of t and the fact that Im(n (, t)m (, t) ) = 0 (from Eq.(B10)) have been used. Hence, evolving nm (0) according to Eq.(B11) and Eq.(B12) alternately and taking the limit t  0 we obtain nm (t) = nm (0)eik ×e

(B13)

while if evolution occurs according to Eq.(B3), then

Combining Eq.(B10), Eq.(B13) and Eq.(B6), and evaluating the integral in Eq.(B13) one can obtain Eqs.(24)(26) of section V, which constitutes the complete solution for the density matrix of the system at an arbitrary time.

On Quantum Mechanical Aspects of Microtubules
N.E. Mavromatosa and D.V. Nanopoulosb,c,d Abstract
We discuss possible quantum mechanical aspects of MicroTubules (MT), based on recent developments in quantum physics. We focus on potential mechanisms for `energyloss-free' transport along the microtubules, which could be considered as realizations of Fr¨hlich's ideas on the r^le of solitons for superconductivity and/or biological matter. In o o particular, by representing the MT arrangements as cavities, we present a novel scenario on the formation of macroscopic (or mesoscopic) quantum-coherent states, as a result of the (quantum-electromagnetic) interactions of the MT dimers with the surrounding molecules of the ordered water in the interior of the MT cylinders. Such states decohere due to dissipation through the walls of the MT. Transfer of energy without dissipation, due to such coherent modes, could occur only if the decoherence time is larger than the average time scale required for energy transfer across the cells. We present some generic order of magnitude estimates of the decoherence time in a typical model for MT dynamics. Our conclusion is that the quantum coherent states play a r^le in energy transfer if the dissipao tion through the walls of the MT cavities is fairly suppressed, corresponding to damping time scales Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec, for moderately large MT networks. We suggest specific experiments to test the above-conjectured quantum nature of the microtubular arrangements inside the cell. These experiments are similar in nature to those in atomic physics, used in the detection of the Rabi-Vacuum coupling between coherent cavity modes and atoms. Our conjecture is that a similar Rabi-Vacuum-splitting phenomenon occurs in the absorption (or emission) spectra of the MT dimers, which would constitute a manifestation of the dimer coupling with the coherent modes in the ordered-water environment (dipole quanta), which emerge due to `super-radiance'.

Introduction

MicroTubules (MT) appear to be one of the most fundamental structures of the interior of living cells [1]. These are paracrystalline cytoskeletal structures which seem to play a fundamental r^le for the cell mitosis. It is also believed that they o play an important r^le for the transfer of electric signals and, more general, of energy o in the cell. In this latter respect it should be mentioned that energy transfer across the cells, without dissipation, had been conjectured to occur in biological matter by Fr¨hlich [2], already some time ago. The phenomenon conjectured by Fr¨hlich was o o based on his one-dimensional superconductivity model: in one dimensional electron systems with holes, the formation of solitonic structures due to electron-hole pairing results in the transfer of electric current without dissipation. In a similar manner, Fr¨hlich conjectured that energy in biological matter could be transfered without o dissipation, if appropriate solitonic structures are formed inside the cells. This idea has lead theorists to construct various models for the energy transfer across the cell, based on the formation of kink classical solutions [3]. In the early works no specific microscopic models had been considered [3]. Recently, however, after the identification of the MT as one of the most important structures of the cell, both functionally and structurally, a model for their dynamics has been presented in ref. [4], in which the formation of solitonic structures, and their r^le in energy transfer across the MT, is discussed in terms of classical physics. o In ref. [5] we have considered the quantum aspects of this one-dimensional model, and argued on the consistent quantization of the soliton solutions, as well as the fact that such semiclassical solutions may emerge as a result of `decoherence' due to environmental entanglement, according to recent ideas [6]. The basic assumption of the model used in ref. [5] was that the fundamental structures in the MT (more specifically of the brain MT) are Ising spin chains (one-space-dimensional structures). The interaction of each chain with the neighboring chains and the surrounding water environment had been mimicked by suitable potential terms in the one-dimensional Hamiltonian. The model describing the dynamics of such one-dimensional sub-structures was the ferroelectric distortive spin chain model of ref. [4]. The one-dimensional nature of these fundamental building blocks, then, opens up the way for a mathematical formulation of the chain as a completely intergrable field theory model, characterized by an infinite-number of conservation laws. The latter are associated with global excitation modes, completely delocalised in the chain space-time. This integrability structure proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity [5]. Such features might turn out to be important for a model of the brain as a quantum computer. This formulation allowed the authors of ref. [5] to employ the so-called Liouville (non-critical) string theory approach to decoherence [7], which is a formalism to treat such completely integrable spin systems embedded in a `two-dimensional quantum gravity environment'. At this point we should stress that such an environment

does not necessarily represent realistic space-time effects. As stressed in ref. [5], an external stimulus may distort the neighboring space-time of the unpaired spins of the MT dimers, and such a distortion may be effectively described by a two-dimensional `metric' in the Liouville picture of MT [5], which should not be necessarily identified with a relatistic four dimensional space time metric 1 . The coupling of the MT chain with its `environment' may lead, according to the analysis of ref. [5], to the formation of macroscopic quantum coherent solitonic states. Then, the details of the environment would play a crucial r^le in determining o the time scales over which such coherent states could be sustained before collapsing to classical ground states. Such analyses have yield important results in the past [10, 11, 6, 12], concerning the passage from the quantum to classical world. In particular, in ref. [6] it was suggested that quantum coherent states may appear as a result of decoherence, depending on the nature of the environment [13]. Such states are minimum entropy/uncertainty states, which propagate `almost classically' in time, in the sense that their shape is retained during evolution. Such `almost classical' states are termed `pointer states' by Zurek [6]. In view of the results of ref. [12], concerning the localization of the wave function in open (stochastic) quantum-mechanical systems, the emergence of pointer states, as a result of decoherence, may be interpreted as implying that the localization process of the state vector had stopped at a stage where it is not complete, but is such that the resulting (minimum-entropy) state is least susceptible to the effects of the environment. Not all environments admit such pointer states [13]. Here lies one of the advantages of viewing the MT system of chains as a completely integrable Liouville-string theory. The model possesses a pointer basis [14], which in ref. [5] has been identified with the quantized (via squeezed-coherent states) soliton solutions of ref. [4]. Another advantage lies on the fact that energy is conserved on the average in the model, despite the environmental entanglement. This is for purely stringy reasons pertaining to the Liouville approach. The reader may find details in ref. [7]. Physically this means that such a formalism is capable of describing energy-loss-free transport in biological cells, thereby providing a realization of Fr¨hlich's ideas [2]. o In this article we focus our attention on the microscopic nature of such coherent states, and try to understand their emergence by as much `conventional' physics arguments as possible. By `conventional' we mean scenaria based on quantum electrodynamics, which are the major interactions expected to dominate at the energy scales of the MT 2 . We make an attempt to pick up possible sources of decoherence,
It is however, possible, that such a distortion involves a sufficient movement of mass so as to create a virtual microscopic singularity in the surrounding space time [8, 9, 5]; this could then cause collapse of the macroscopic quantum state, leading to conscious perception. Such daring assumptions/conjectures have gain some support by the fact that in certain physical models of MT dynamics [5] the estimated time of collapse is of order O(1 sec), which is in excellent qualitative agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings in Neurobiology. In the present work we shall not discuss these issues. 2 According to the above discussion, then, quantum gravity entanglement could be, if at all, important for the decoherence of the coherent state formed as a result of the water-dimer coupling.

consistent with the above-mentioned energy-loss-free transfer scenario in biological cells, and estimate the associated time scales. The structure of this article is a follows: in section 2 we review briefly the physical one-dimensional model describing MT dynamics, and discuss briefly the mathematical background for obtaining solitonic structures. An important r^le for o the existence of the solitonic structures is played by the ordered water in the interior of the MT. The importance of the water in the interior of the MT has been emphasized by S. Hameroff, in connection with information processing, already some time ago [15, 16]. In our article we present a scenario for the formation of electric-dipole quantum coherent modes in the water of the MT, inspired by earlier suggestions on `laser-like' behaviour of the water [17, 18, 19]. Such coherent modes couple with the unpaired electrons of the MT dimers. In this work we conjecture that such a coupling would result in the so-called Vacuum Field Rabi Splitting (VFRS) [20], a sort of dynamical Stark effect occuring in the emission or absorption spectra of the dimers as a result of the vaccum quantum fluctuations. This phenomenon is characteristic of the behaviour of atoms inside quantum electrodynamical cavities, the r^le of which is played in our work by the o MT cylindrical structures themselves. A review of this phenomenon in the atomic physics is given in section 3. The atomic Rabi Splitting is a consequence of the coupling of the atoms with the coherent modes of electromagnetic radiation inside the cavity. It is considered by many as a `proof' of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation [20]. In our work, we consider this phenomenon, if true, as a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of the MT arrangement inside the cell. This is discussed in section 4, where we present a scenario according to which the MT arrangements inside the cell act as fairly isolated cavities. The ordered-water molecules in their interior, then, provides an environment, necessary to form coherent quantum modes (dipole quanta) [17, 18, 19], whose coupling with the dimers results in VFRS in the respective absorption spectra. Due to dissipation from the cavity walls, there is decoherence of the combined dimer-cavity system coherent state. The resulting decoherence time scales are estimated, for various sources of envirnoments. The main conclusion of our analysis is that in order for the quantum coherent states to play a r^le in dissipationless energy transfer, i.e. the decoherence o time to be larger than the the scale required for energy transfer in MT - estimated to be of O(5 × 10-7 sec), for a moderately long MT, in the model of ref. [4] - the damping time scales of the MT cavities must be Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec. Finally, in section 5, we present our conclusions and suggest some epxeriments to test the above-conjectured quantum mechanical origin of MT arrangements inside the cell. The experiments are inspired by the physics of Rydberg atoms in
However this would require extreme isolation of the MT system, so that any conventional decoherence due to ordinary environmental entanglement is suppressed. Such isolated MT subsystems have been conjectured to occur in certain parts of brain, in which case quantum gravity plays a r^le in consciousness by inducing a collapse of the coherent-state of the MT dimers [5, 8, 9]. At o present, we do not know whether this is feasible inside the brain.

Review of the Physical Model for Microtubule Dynamics
Classical Considerations

MicroTubules (MT) are hollow cylinders comprised of an exterior surface (of crosssection diameter 25 nm) with 13 arrays (protofilaments) of protein dimers called tubulines. The interior of the cylinder (of cross-section diameter 14 nm) contains ordered water molecules, which implies the existence of an electric dipole moment and an electric field. The arrangement of the dimers is such that, if one ignores their size, they resemble triangular lattices on the MT surface. Each dimer consists of two hydrophobic protein pockets, and has an unpaired electron. There are two possible positions of the electron, called  and  conformations. When the electron is in the -conformation there is a 29o distortion of the electric dipole moment as compared to the  conformation. In standard models for the simulation of the MT dynamics, the `physical' degree of freedom - relevant for the description of the energy transfer - is the projection of the electric dipole moment on the longitudinal symmetry axis (x-axis) of the MT cylinder. The 29o distortion of the -conformation leads to a displacement un along the x-axis, which is thus the relevant physical degree of freedom. This way, the effective system is one-dimensional (spatial), and one has the possibility of a quantum integrable system [5]. Information processing occurs via interactions among the MT protofilament chains. The system may be considered as similar to a model of interacting Ising chains on a trinagular lattice, the latter being defined on the plane stemming from fileting open and flatening the cylindrical surface of MT. Classically, the various dimers can occur in either  or  conformations. Each dimer is influenced by the neighboring dimers resulting in the possibility of a transition. This is the basis for classical information processing, which constitutes the picture of a (classical) cellular automatum. The quantum computer character of the MT network results from the assumption that each dimer finds itself in a superposition of  and  conformations [8]. Viewed as a two-state quantum mechanical system, the MT tubulin dimers couple to conformational changes with 10-9 - 10-11 sec transitions, corresponding to an angular frequency   O(1010 )-O(1012 ) Hz. In the present work we assume the upper bound of this frequency range to represent (in order of magnitude) the characteristic frequency of the dimers, viewed as a two-state quantum-mechanical system: 0  O(1012 ) Hz (1)

The scenario for quantum computation in MT presuposes that there exists a macroscopic coherent state among the various chains. Let us now try to understand

its emergence. Let un be the displacement field of the n-th dimer in a MT chain. The continuous approximation proves sufficient for the study of phenomena associated with energy transfer in biological cells, and this implies that one can make the replacement un  u(x, t) (2) with x a spatial coordinate along the longitudinal symmetry axis of the MT. There is a time variable t due to fluctuations of the displacements u(x) as a result of the dipole oscillations in the dimers. At this stage, t is viewed as a reversible variable. The effects of the neighboring dimers (including neighboring chains) can be phenomenologically accounted for by an effective potential V (u). In the model of ref. [4] a double-well potential was used, leading to a classical kink solution for the u(x, t) field. More complicated interactions are allowed in the string picture, as explained in ref. [5]. More generic polynomial potential have also been considered in ref. [5]. The effects of the surrounding water molecules can be summarized by a viscuous force term that damps out the dimer oscillations, F = -t u (3)

with  determined phenomenologically at this stage. This friction should be viewed as an environmental effect, which however does not lead to energy dissipation, as a result of the non-trivial solitonic structure of the ground-state and the non-zero constant force due to the electric field. This is a well known result, directly relevant to energy transfer in biological systems [3]. In mathematical terms the effective equation of motion for the relevant field degree of freedom u(x, t) reads: u () + u () = P (u) (4)

where  = x-vt, v is the velocity of the soliton,    [4], and P (u) is a polynomial in u, of a certain degree, stemming from the variations of the potential V (u) describing interactions among the MT chains [5]. In the mathematical literature [23] there has been a classification of solutions of equations of this form. For certain forms of the potential, the solutions include kink solitons that may be responsible for dissipation-free energy transfer in biological cells 3 . A typical propagation velocity
In the `string picture of MT' the various solutions are related [5] by appropriate Renormalization-Scheme changes on the world-sheet of the string (generalizaing appropriately the particle like structures). This is reflected in certain ambiguities in the form of the string potential V (u); what seems to be a unique phenomenological potential in point-like theory, determining various forms of soliton solutions, may not have such a unique interpretation in the completelyintegrable (non-critical) string picture of MT. This suggests that the point-like field theory soliton solutions, discussed above, constitute only a `low-energy' approximation of more complicated (solitonic) ground states of the string. As discussed in the context of Liouville strings in ref. [5], such stringy ground states share similar properties with their point­like theory counterparts as far as dissipation-free energy transfer is concerned.

of the kink solitons of ref. [4] is v  2 m/sec. This implies that for moderately long microtubules, of length L  10-6 m, such kinks transport energy in tF  5 × 10-7 sec (5)

This scale is larger than the time scale that Fr¨hlich had conjectured as correspondo ing to the frequency of the coherent phonons in biological matter (t  10-11 - 10-12 s). In this article, however, we shall keep calling the time (5) the Fr¨hlich scale, o since, upon quantization, the kink soliton solutions of ref. [4] yield quantum coherent states [5] that are very similar to Fr¨hlich's phonons. o Therefore, in the above `phenomenological' approach to the MT physics, the importance of the water environment can be seen formally as follows: were it not for the friction term (3) there would be no stable solitonic structures in the ferroelectric distortive model of ref. [4] 4 .

2.2

Quantum Considerations

Let us attempt a microscopic analysis of the physics underlying the interaction of the water molecules with the dimers of the MT. Our investigation points towards the fact that, as a result of the ordered structure of the water environment, there appear collective coherent modes, which in turn interact with the dimer structures (mainly through the unpaired electrons of the dimers) leading to the formation of a quantum coherent solitonic state that extends over the whole network of MT. According to the idea put forward in ref. [5], following ref. [6], such coherent states should be viewed as the result of decoherence of the dimer system due to its interaction/coupling with the water environment. As we shall argue below, such a coupling could be detected by a phenomenon analogous to what is happening in atoms interacting with coherent modes of the electromagnetic radiation in Cavities, namely the Vacuum-Field Rabi Slitting (VFRS) [20]. Our conjecture is that the interior of MT, full of ordered water molecules, can be viewed as a cavity rather than a wave guide; the cavity structure can be formed by `closing' the ends of the MT, and is a way of providing a fairly isolated system which can sustain coherent modes. This type of environmental entanglement is described in the Liouville framework by the world-sheet renormalization-group -function,  u , of the displacement field, u(x), of the dimers, decribed above. A non-trivial  u = 0 expresses deviations from conformal invariance, as a consequence of environmental entanglement [5]. The -function corresponds to an energy-dependent environmental coupling, since its magnitude depends on the energy of the field u(x) [5]:  u = O[(E/Ms )2 ] (6)

In the (non-critical) Liouville string picture such a coupling is responsible for the appearance of the appropriate `dilaton'-like terms in the world-sheet action, which are essential for consistency of the Liouville string [24, 25, 5].

where Ms is a string scale, characteristic of the problem. The scale Ms acts as an ultraviolet cut-off for the energies of the low-energy field theory obtained from the `string', and its size depends on the details of the subsystem u(x, t) as well as the environment. The Master Equation for the time evolution of the density matrix  of the displacement field u in the Liouville approach reads [7, 5]: t  = i[, H] + i u [, u]Ms (7)

where H is the Hamiltonian of the dimer chain. The decoherence time in this approach is estimated as [5]: tdecoh/Liouv  1 N  u Ms (8)

where N denotes the number of dimers in the MT chain. The time scale (8) is the time over which the solitonic quantum coherent pointer states are formed in the MT networks, as a result of the ordered-water-induced decoherence. We now remark that, in the approach of viewing the MT as cavities, the main source of dissipation will then be the leakage of photons or other coherent modes from the cavity. Its rate can be assumed small for the MT of the brain, otherwise the incoherent mode will dominate. This dissipation constitutes an ordinary environment, which cannot lead to the formation of pointer states, but instead induces eventual collapse of the solitonic states into completely classical ground states. Hence, according to the above discussion, there are two stages when decoherence plays an important r^le. o · (i) The first stage concerns the coupling of the system of dimers with the coherent modes formed in the ordered water. This coupling pertains to a specific environment which induces decoherence in the dimer sub-system. producing quantum coherent states (`pointer states') according to refs. [6, 5]. The time scale of this decoherence corresponds to the time scale necessary for the formation of the solitonic coherent states of ref. [5], see eq. (8) above. · (ii) The second stage refers to the decoherence due to ordinary dissipation through the walls of the (imperfect) MT cavities. Such an ordinary environment does not admit a pointer basis [13], but causes collapse of the quantum coherent state of stage (i) down to a classical ground state. In this article, we shall estimate the decoherence time scales of both stages (i) and (ii) and compare them with the Fr¨hlich scale. Moreover, we shall propose o specific experimental tests for the detection of the quantum-mechanical behaviour of the MT arrangements inside the cell. An important feature of all these tests is, as we mentioned previously, the Vacuum-Field Rabi Splitting phenomenon, to a brief description of which we now turn for instructive purposes.

On the Rabi Splitting in Atomic Physics and the Quantum Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation
Description of the Rabi splitting phenomenon

3.1

In this section we shall recapitulate briefly the VFRS in atomic physics. This phenomenon has been predicted for the emission spectra of atoms inside electromagnetic cavities [20], in an attempt to understand the quantized nature of the electromagnetic radiation. The basic principle underlying the phenomenon is that, in the presence of an interaction among two oscillators in resonance, the frequency degeneracy is removed by an amount proportional to the strength of the coupling. In the cavity QED case of ref. [20], one oscillator consists of a small collection of N atoms, whilst the other is a resonant mode of a high-Q(uality) cavity 5 . Immediately after the suggestion of ref. [20], a similar phenomenon has been predicted for absorption spectra of atoms in cavities [27]. By now, the situation has been verified experimentally on a number of occasions [21]. In such experiments one excites the coupled atom-cavity system by a tuneable field probe. The excitation is then found resonant not at the `bare' atom or cavity frequencies but at the split frequencies of the `dressed' atom-field system. The spliting is enhanced for collections of atoms. For instance, as we shall review below, for a system of N atoms, the split is predicted to be [27]:  2 = Rabi splitting of a single atom (9) Rabi splitting = 2 N Despite its theoretical prediction by means of quantum mechanical oscillator systems coupled with a quantized radiation field mode in a cavity, at present there seems to be still a debate on the nature of the phenomenon: (i) the dominant opinion is that the Rabi splitting is a manifestation of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation (cavity field), and is caused as a result of an entanglement between the atom and the cavity coherent modes of radiation. It is a sort of Stark effect, but here it occurs in the absence of an external field [20]. This `dynamical Stark effect' is responsible for a splitting of the resonant lines of the atoms by an amount proportional to the collective atomic-dipole amplitude. (ii) there is however a dual interpretation [28], which claims that the splitting can be observed in optical cavities as well, and it is simply a result of classical wave mechanics inside the cavity, where the atomic sample behaves as a refractive medium with a complex index, which splits the cavity mode into two components. Irrespectively of this second classical interpretation, one cannot deny the presence of the phenomenon in entangled atom-quantum-coherent mode systems. This is the point of view we shall be taking in this work, in connection with our picture of viewing MT filled with ordered water as cavities. We shall try to make specific
The quantity Q is defined as the ratio of the stored-energy to the energy-loss per period [26], by making the analogy with a damped harmonic oscillator.

experimental predictions that could shed light in the formation of quantum coherent states, and their eventual decoherence. As mentioned above, the latter could be due to the interaction of the dimer unpaired spins (playing the r^le of the atoms in the o Rabi experiments) with the ordered-water coherent modes (playing the r^le of the o cavity fields). Possible scenaria for the origin of such cavity coherent modes will be described below. Let us first recapitulate briefly the theoretical basis of the Rabi-splitting phenomenon, which will allow the non-expert reader to assess the situation better. We shall present the phenomenon from a point of view that will help us transcribe it directly to the MT case. Consider an atom of a frequency 0 in interaction with a single coherent mode of electromagnetic radiation field of frequency . The relevant Hamiltonian is: H = h0 ¯
i

Siz + ha a + ¯
i

(¯ Si+ a + H.C.) h

(10)

where a , a are the creation and annihilation cavity radiation field modes, Siz ,Si± are the usual spin- 1 operators, and  is the atom-field coupling. The atom-field 2 system is not an isolated system, since there is dissipation due to the interaction of the system with the surrounding world. An important source of dissipation is the leakage of photons from the cavity at some rate . If the rate of dissipation is not too big, then a quantum coherent state can be formed, which would allow the observation of the vacuum-field Rabi oscillations. The density matrix  of the atom-field system obeys a Markov-type master equation for the evolution in time t [27]: i t  = - [H, ] - (a a - 2aa + a a) (11) h ¯  The limit  <<  N guarantees the possibility of the formation of a quantum coherent state, i.e. this limit describes environments that are weakly coupled to the system, and therefore the decoherence times (see below) are very long. In this limit one can concentrate on the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, and make the following (`secular') approximation for their evolution [27]: i (12) t ij = - (Ei - Ej )ij - ij ij h ¯ where ij denotes the damping factor, pertaining to the weak coupling of the atomfield system to the environment. The analysis of ref. [27] pertained to the evaluation of the susceptibility tensor of the system,  , which can be calculated by considering its interaction of the system with an external field of frequency . The absorption spectrum is proportional to Im(). A standard quantum-mechanical computation yields the result [27]: Im() = cos2  - / + 1 + { - 0 + /2 - 2 (2 + 4N2 )1/2 }2 + / sin2  2 + + { - 0 + /2 + 1 (2 + 4N2 )1/2 }2 2 2 -

with   0 - . In the above expression the damping factors ± represent the damping in the equation of motion for the off-diagonal element of the density matrix < 0 ||S,C > where ± are eigenfucntions of H, classified by the eigenvalues of ± the operators S 2 , and S z + a a  C, in particular [27]: S = N/2, and C = 1 - N/2. The expression (13) summarizes the effect of Rabi-vacuum splitting in absorption spectra of atoms: there is a doublet structure (splitting) of the absorption spectrum with peaks at: 1  = 0 - /2 ± (2 + 4N2 )1/2 (14) 2 For resonant cavities the splitting occurs with equal weights   = 0 ±  N (15) Notice here the enhancement in the effect for multi-atom systems N >> 1. This is the `Vacuum Field Rabi Splitting phenomenon', predicted in emission spectra in ref. [20]. As we have already mentioned, the above derivation pertains to absorption spectra, where the situation is formally much simpler [27]. It is also this latter case that is of interest to  for the purposes of this work. us The quantity 2 N is called the `Rabi frequency' [20]. From the emissionspectrum theoretical analysis an estimate of  may be inferrred which involves the matrix element, d, of atomic electric dipole between the energy states of the two-level atom [20]: Evac d.

whilst no energy exchange takes place between atom and cavity mode. This is also the case of interest in experiments using such Rabi couplings to construct

As mentioned above, there are simple experiments which confirmed this effect [21], involving beams of Rydberg atoms resonantly coupled to superconducting cavities. The situation which is of interest to us involves atoms that are near resonance with the cavity.

Schr¨dinger's cats in the laboratory, i.e. macro(meso)scopic combinations `measuro ing apparatus + atoms' to verify decoherence experimentally. The first experiment of this sort, which confirms theoretical expectations, is described in ref. [29]. Another important issue, which has been used above, and in ref. [29], is the dephasing of the atom as a result of the above-described atom-field Rabi entanglement. To understand better the situation, let us discuss a more generic case, that of a three-state atom, f, e, g, with energies Eg > Ee > Ef . Suppose one is interested in the transition f  e by absorption, in the presence of atoms in interaction with + - + a cavity mode. Calling Def  |e >< f |,Def  |f >< e| = (Def ) , we have the effective Hamiltonian for the transition f  e [30]:
ef + - Hef f = hef f Def Def ¯

;

ef f = ef +

2 n 

(19)

where the `effective' frequency ef f incorporates the dispersive frequency shifts (18) of the Rabi effect, appropriate for near-resonant atom-cavity-field systems; n is the number of cavity photons 7 . Consider now an experiment to measure, say, the photon number n in the cavity. The relevant probe P can be the above-described three-state atom, in a superposition of e and f states. In this picture the photon number n is an eigenvalue of the cavity signal operator a as ; the interaction Hamiltonian between atom and cavity then s reads [30]: h2  ¯ + - HI = a as Def Def (20)  s The probe observable is the atomic dipole operator: AP = 1 + - (D - Def ) 2i ef (21)

The Heisenberg evolution of this operator yields: i¯ h d ef AP = [AP , Hef f + HI ] dt (22)

from which it is easily seen that in a time interval t the phase of the probe is changing by: 2 n  = ef t + t (23)  The case of interest for the experiment of ref. [29] is a two-state atom; the resulting phase shift is then obtained from (23) by setting ef = 0. In that case, the phase entanglement due to the atom-field Rabi coupling is R =

 Notice that the n characteristic scaling law for the Rabi splitting (15) is also valid in the case of interaction of a single atom with n cavity oscillator quanta (e.g. a coherent cavity mode).

for a near resonance atom-field system, with a small detuning . Such a situation is encountered precisely in the experiment of ref. [29], which will constitute our prototype for the extension of the above results to the MT case. Before doing so it is instructive to review briefly the experiment of [29], where decoherence of an open mesoscopic system (`Schr¨dinger's cat') has been demonstrated. o

3.2

Rabi splitting and decoherence: experimenal verification

The experiment consists of sending a Rubidium atom with two circular Rydberg states e and g, through a microwave cavity storing a small coherent field | >. The coherent cavity mode is mesoscopic in the sense of possessing an average number of photons of order O(10). The atom-cavity coupling is measured by the Rabi frequency 2/2 = 48 kHz. The condition for Rabi dispersive shifts (18) is satisfied by having a /2  [70, 800] kHz. The set up of the experiment is as follows: The atom is prepared in the superposition of e, g states, by virtue of a resonant microwave cavity R1 . Then it crosses the cavity C, which is coupled to a reservoir that damps its energy (dissipation) at a characteristic time scale Tr << 1.5.ms. Typical cavities, used for atomic scale experiments such as the above, have dimensions which lie in the mm range or at most cm range. In the cavity C a number of photons varying from 0 to 10 is injected by a pulse source. The field in the cavity relaxes to vacuum - thereby causing dissipation through leakeage of photons through the cavity - during a time Tr , before being regenerated for the next atom. The experiment is at an effective temperature of T = 0.6K, which is low enough so as to minimize thermal effects. After leaving C, the atom passes through a second cavity R2 , identical to R1 ; one then measures the probability of finding the atom in the state, say, g. This would mean decoherence. The decoherence time is measured for various photon numbers; this helps testing the theoretical predictions that decoherence between two `pointer states' of a quantum superposition occurs at a rate proportional to the square of the distance among the states [31, 32, 6, 11]. Let us understand this latter point better. The coherent oscillator states, characterizing the cavity modes, constitute such a pointer basis: an oscillator in a coherent  state is defined by the average number of oscillator quanta n as: | >: || = n. Then, consider the measurement of the above-described experiment, according to which there is only a phase entanglement between the cavity and the atom: the combined atom-cavity (meter) system is originally in the state | >= |e, ei > +|g, e-i > (25)

According to (24) the dephasing is atomic-level dependent   2 tn/. Coupling the oscillator to a reservoir, that damps its energy in a characteristic time scale Tr , produces decoherence. According to the general theory [10, 32, 30, 31] the latter occurs during a time scale inversely proportional to the square of the distance

between the `pointer' states D 2 : tcollapse = 2Tr D2 (26)

This is easy to verify in a prototype toy model, involving only a phase entanglement, i.e. without energy dissipation. To this end, consider the Hamiltonian: H = ha a + a a ¯ (27)

with a , a creation and annihilation operators of a quantum oscillator, and  a phase damping. The `pointer' states for this problem are characterized by the eigenvalues n of the number operator a a which commutes with the Hamiltonian [a a , H] = 0, i.e. the pointer basis is {|n >}. The pertinent Markov master equation for the density matrix, , reads: t  =   (2a aa a - a aa a - a aa a) 2 (28)

Writing (t) = m,n mn (t)|n >< m| it is straightforward to determine the time dependence of nm (t) from (28) nm (t) = e-(n-m)
2 t/2

nm (0)

(29)

which implies that the coherence between two different (m = n) pointer (number) 1 states is damped at a typical scale given by (26), where Tr =  , and the distance D is given by n - m in the above example . As mentioned previously, this inverse D 2 -behaviour seems to be a generic feature of open (decohering) systems, including open string models [7, 5]. In the set up of ref. [29] the distance D is given by  2 t D = 2 nsin  2n3/2  (30)

for Rabi couplings 2, such that 2 tn << . For mesoscopic systems n  10, D > 1, and, hence, decoherence occurs over a much shorter time scale than Tr ; in particular, for /2  70kHz the decoherence time is 0.24Tr [29]. This concludes the construction of a Schr¨dinger's cat, and the associated `measurement process'. Noo tice that the above construction is made in two stages: first it involves an interaction of the atom with the cavity field, which results in a coherent state of the combined `atom-meter', and then dissipation is induced by coupling the cavity (measuring apparatus) to the environment, which damps its energy, thereby inducing decoherence in the `atom+meter' system. The important point to realize is that the more macroscopic the cavity mode is (i.e. the higher the number of oscillator quanta), the shorter the decoherence time is. This is exactly what was to be expected from the general theory [6, 10, 11, 7].

Rabi Vacuum Coupling in MT and Energy Transfer in the Cell
Microscopic Mechanisms for the formation of Coherent States in MT

Above we have sketched the experimental construction of a mesoscopic quantum coherent state (a `Schr¨dinger's cat' (SC)). The entanglement of the atom with the o coherent cavity mode, manifested experimentally by the `vacuum Rabi splitiing', leads to a quantum-coherent state for the combined atom-cavity system (SC), comprising of the superposition of the states of the two-level Rydberg atom. Dissipation induced by the leakage of photons in the cavity leads to decoherence of the coherent atom-cavity state, in a time scale given by (26). This time scale depends crucially on the nature of the coupled system, and the nature of the `environment'. It is the point of this session to attempt to discuss a similar situation that conjecturally occurs in the systems of MT. We believe that understanding the formation of Schr´dinger's o cats in MT networks will unravel, if true, the mysteries of the brain as a (quantum) computer, which might also be related to the important issue of `conscious perception', as advocated in refs. [9, 8, 5]. The first issue concerns the nature of the `cavity-field modes'. Our point in this section is to argue that the presence of ordered water, which seems to occupy the interior of the microtubules [16], plays an important r^le in producing coherent o modes, which resemble those of the ordinary electromagnetic field in superconducting cavities, discussed above. Let us first review briefly some suggestions about the r^le of the electric dipole o moment of water molecules in producing coherent modes after coupling with the electromagnetic radiation field [17]. Such a coupling implies a `laser-like' behaviour. Although it is not clear to us whether such a behaviour characterizes ordinary water, in fact we believe it does not due to the strong suppression of such couplings in the disordered ordinary water, however it is quite plausible that such a behaviour characterizes the ordered water molecules that exist in the interior of MT [16]. If true, then this electric dipole-quantum radiation coupling will be responsible, according to the analysis of ref. [17], for the appearance of collective quantum coherent modes. The Hamiltonian used in the theoretical model of ref. [17] is:
M

How =

[
j=1

1 2 L + A.dej ] 2I j

(31)

where A is the quantized electromagnetic field in the radiation gauge [17], M is the number of water molecules, Lj is the total angular momentum vector of a single molecule, I is the associated (average) moment of inertia, and dej is the electric dipole vector of a single molecule, |dej |  2e  de , with de  0.2 Angstr¨m. As a o result of the dipole-radiation interaction in (31) coherent modes emerge, which in ref. [18] have been interpreted as arising from the quantization of the Goldstone

modes responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electric dipole (rotational) symmetry. Such modes are termed `dipole quanta' in ref. [18]. This kind of mechanism has been applied to microtubules [19], with the conclusion that such coherent modes cause `super-radiance', i.e. create a specific quantummechanical ordering in the water molecules with characteristic times much shorter than those of thermal interaction. In addition, the optical medium inside the internal hollow core of the microtubule is made transparent by the coherent photons themselves [19]. Such phenomena, if observed, could verify the coherent-mode emission from living matter, thereby verifying Fr¨hlich's ideas. o In our picture of viewing the MT arrangements as cavities, these coherent modes are the quantum coherent `oscillator' modes of section 3, represented by annihilation and creation operators ac , a , which play the r^le of the cavity modes, if the orderedo c water interior of the MT is viewed as an isolated cavity 8 . The r^le of the small o collection of atoms, described in the atomic physics analogue above, is played in this picture by the protein dimers of the MT chains. The latter constitute a two-state system due to the  and  conformations, defined by the position on the unpaired spin in the dimer pockets. The presence of unpaired electrons is crucial to such an analogy. The interaction of the dipole-quanta coherent modes with the protein dimers results in an entanglement which we claim is responsible for the emergence of soliton quantum coherent states, extending over large scale, e.g. the MT or even the entire MT network. The issue, we are concerned with here, is whether such coherent states are responsible for energy-loss-free transport, as well as for quantum computations due to their eventual collapse, as a result of `environmental' entanglement of the entire `MT dimers + ordered water' system. An explicit construction of such solitonic states has been made in the field-theoretic model for MT dynamics of ref. [5], based on classical ferroelectric models for the displacement field u(x, t) discussed in section 2 [4]. The quantum-mechanical picture described here should be viewed as a simplification of the field-theoretic formalism, which, however, is sufficient for qualitative estimates of the induced decoherence.

4.2

Decoherence and dissipationless energy transfer

To study quantitatively the effects of decoherence in MT systems we make the plaussible assumption that the environmental entanglement of the `ordered-water cavity' (OWC), which is responsible for dissipation, is attributed entirely to the leakage
This was not the picture envisaged in ref. [17]. However, S. Hameroff, as early as 1974, had conjectured the r^le of MT as `dielectric waveguides' for photons [15], and in ref. [19] some o detailed mathematical construction of the emergence of coherent modes out of the ordered water are presented. In our work in this article we consider the implications of such coherent modes for the system of dimers, in particular for the formation of kink solitons of ref. [4]. Thus, our approach is different from that in refs. [17, 19], where attention has been concentrated only on the properties of the water molecules. We should emphasize that the phenomenon of optical transparency due to super-radiance may co-exist with the formation of kink soliton coherent states along the dimer chains, relevant to the dissipation-free energy transfer along the MT, discussed in the present work.

of photons (electromagnetic radiation quanta) from the MT interior of volume V (`cavity'). This leakage may occur from the nodes of the MT network, if one assumes fairly isolated interia. This leakage will cause decoherence of the coherent state of the `MT dimer-OWC' system. The leakage determines the damping time scale Tr in (26). The dimers with their two conformational states , play the r^le of the collection o of N two-level Rydberg atoms in the atomic physics analogue described in section 3. If we now make the assumption that the ordered-water dipole-quantum coherent modes couple to the dimers of the MT chains in a way similar to the one leading to a Rabi splitting, described above, then one may assume a coupling 0 of order: 0  ddimer Eow h ¯ (32)

where ddimer is the single-dimer electric dipole matrix element, associated wiith the transition from the  to the  conformation, and Eow is a r.m.s. typical value of the amplitude of a coherent dipole-quantum field mode. Given that each dimer has a mobile charge [1]: q = 18×2e, e the electron charge, one may estimate ddimer  36 × 0 × 1.6. × 10-19 × 4.10-9  3 × 10-18 Cb × Angstrom  (33)

where we used the fact that a typical distance for the estimate of the electric dipole moment for the `atomic' transition between the ,  conformations is of O(4 nm), i.e. of order of the distance between the two hydrophobic dimer pockets. We also took account of the fact that, as a result of the water environment, the electric charge of the dimers appears to be screened by the relative dielectric constant of the water, /0  80. We note, however, that the biological environment of the unpaired electric charges in the dimer may lead to further suppression of ddimer (33). The amplitude of the collective modes of the dipole-quanta may be estimated using the formula (17). In our case the `cavity volume' is: V  5 × 10-22 m3 (34)

which is a typical MT volume, for a moderately long MT L  10-6 m, considered as an isolated cavity 9 , and c a typical frequency of the dipole quanta collective mode dynamics. To estimate this frequency we assume, following the `super-radiance' model of ref. [19], that the dominant modes are those with frequencies in the
Here we consider only a single unit of the MT network. The MT network consists of a large number of such cavities/MT. Our scenario here is to examine soliton formation in a single (isolated) cavity MT, with the only source of dissipation the leakage of photons. This would explain the formation of kinks in a single MT [4, 5]. If the entire network of MT is viewed as a cavity, then the volume V is complicated, but in that case the volume can be estimated roughly as Nmt V , with V the average volume of each MT, and Nmt the number of MT in the network population. In such a case, the solitonic state extends over the entire network of MT. It is difficult to model such a situation by simple one-dimensional Hamiltonians as in refs. [4, 5].

range c  /¯ , where  is the energy difference between the two principal energy h eigenstates of the water molecule, which are assumed to play the dominant r^le in o the interaction with the (quantized) electromagnetic radiation field. For the water molecule: hc  4 meV ¯ (35) which yields c  /¯  6 × 1012 s-1 h (36) This is of the same order as the characteristic frequency of the dimers (1), implying that the dominant cavity mode and the dimer system are almost in resonance. Note that this is a feature shared by the Atomic Physics systems in Cavities examined in section 3, and thus we may apply the pertinent formalism to our system. From (17) one obtains for the r.m.s Eow in order of magnitude: Eow  104 V/m (37)

where we took into account the relative dielectric constant of water /0  80. It has not escaped our attention that the electric fields of such order of magnitude can be provided by the electromagnetic interactions of the MT dimer chains, the latter viewed as giant electric dipoles [4]. This may be seen to suggest that the superradiance coherent modes c , which in our scenario interact with the unpaired electric charges of the dimers and produce the kink solitons along the chains, owe their existence to the (quantized) electromagnetic interactions of the dimers themselves. We assume that the system of N MT dimers interacts with a single dipolequantum mode of the ordered water and we ignored interactions among the dimer spins 10 . In our work here we concentrate our attention on the formation of a coherent soliton along a single dimer chain, the interactions of the remaining 12 chains in a protofilament MT cylinder being represented by appropriate interaction terms in the effective potential of the chain MT model of ref. [4]. In a moderately long microtubule of length L  10-6 m there are N = L/8  102 (38)

tubulin dimers of average length 8 nm in each chain. Then, from (32), (33), and (37), the conjectured Rabi-vacuum splitting, describing the entanglement of the interior coherent modes with the dimers can be estimated to be of order  Rabi coupling for MT  M T = N 0  3 × 1011 s-1 (39) which is, on average, an order of magnitude smaller than the characteristic frequency of the dimers (1). In this way, the perturbative analysis of section 3, for small Rabi
More complicated situations, including interactions among the dimers, as well as of the dimers with more than one radiation quanta, which might undoubtedly occur in nature, complicate the above estimate.

implying that the condition 2 N /||2 << 1, necessary for the perturbative analysis 0 of section 3, is satisfied. The Rabi frequency (39) corresponds to an energy splitting hM T  0.1 meV for a moderately long MT. ¯ Having estimated the Rabi coupling between the dimers and the ordered-water coherent modes we now proceed to estimate the average time scale necessary for the formation of the pointer coherent states which arise due to this entanglement [6, 5]. This is the same as the decoherence time due to the water-dimer coupling. In such a case one may use the Liouville model of MT [5], discussed in section 2.2, which is known to possess pointer coherent states [14]. The relevant decoherence time scale is given by (8). For an accurate estimate of the decoherence time one should have a precise knowledge of the violations of conformal invariance associated with the water-dimer coupling. Unlike the quantum-gravity induced decoherence case, where a microscopic model for the description of the distortions caused in the environment of the chain by the external stimuli is available [5], at present a precise conformal-fieldtheory model for the description of the water-dimer coupling is lacking. However, for our purposes here, it suffices to use our generic approach to the string-theory representation of MT chains, described in ref. [5], where a good orderof-magnitude estimate for  u is provided by (6). We, therefore, merely need to have an estimate of the scales E and Ms for the problem at hand. To estimate the `string' scale Ms in our case 11 , where only quantum-electromagnetic interactions enter, we notice that in the standard string theory Ms acts as an ultraviolet cut-off in the energy of the effective target-sace field theory, in our case the field theory of the displacement field u(x, t). Since in the ferroelectric chain the closest distance separating two unpaired electrons, which are assumed to have the dominant interactions with the water, is the size of a tubulin dimer  dmin = 4 nm, an order of magnitiude estimate of Ms is: Ms  hv0 /dmin  1.5 × 10-4 eV, ¯ (41)

splittings  << 0 , is valid. Indeed, as can be seen from (1),(36), the detuning  is of order: /0  O(10) - O(100) (40)

where we took into account that the Liouville model for MT in ref. [5] is formally a relativistic string model, but with the r^le of the velocity of light played by the o sound velocity v0 = 1Km/sec in organic biological materials. It is interesting to note that this cut-off in energies is slightly higher than the kinetic energies of fast kinks, propagating with the valocity of sound. Indeed such energies are of order E0  10-2 eV. Such fast kinks have been associated in ref. [5] with quantum gravitational
In ref. [5], where scenaria for gravity-induced conscious perception were discussed, the scale Ms was taken to be the Planck scale 1019 GeV. In that case decoherence was induced by the coupling of the entire network of brain MT to quantum-gravity fluctuations due to the distortion of the surrounding space time, as result of abrupt conformational changes in the dimers, caused by external stimuli [9, 8, 5].
11

effects, due to abrupt distortions of space time, and hence their exclusion in the approach of the present work, by considering kinks with energies much less than those, as implied by Ms , is consistent with our considering only electromagnetic interactions among the dimers and its environment. The above estimate allows us to get an idea of the typical energy scales of the excitations of the MT systems that dominate the ordered-water-dimer coupling, in the above scenario, and lead to decoherence. As discussed in ref. [5], the dominant part of the energy of a kink in the model of ref. [4] is of order 1eV, and thus much higher than the Ms (41). Such scales may play a r^le in the decoherence o due to quantum-gravity entanglements [5], which however is much weaker than the electromagnetic ones considered here. On the other hand, as we shall argue now, a typical energy scale for the dimer displacement field u(x, t), much smaller than Ms , and therefore consistent with our low-energy approach, is provided by the kinetic energy of the kink, which is estimated to be of order [4] Ekin  5 × 10-8 eV (42)

As we shall argue below, this energy scale may be used for our estimate of the time scale (8), which is necessary for the formation of the coherent state due to the waterdimer coupling. We stresss that (42) should not be considered as a typical energy scale associated with the excitation spectrum of the dimers, pertaining to the Rabi splitting discussed above. It is rather an `effective scale', characterising `friction' effects between the dimers and the water environment. The latter are responsible [5] for decoherence and the eventual formation of the kink coherent states, which are minimum-entropy states [6], least susceptible to the effects of the water environent. To justify the above estimate, one should notice that the formation of coherent quantum states through decoherence due to friction [6] is the quantum analogue of the `drift velocity' acquired by a Brownian particle in classical mechanics. In the (non-relativistic) conformal-field-theory setting of ref. [5] such a friction could be described by the formation of point-like defects on the dimer chains, which could be described by appropriate non-relativistic membrane backgrounds in the 1 + 1dimensional string theory representation of the MT dynamics. Such membranes are stringy defects, which, for instance, could describe the result of an abrupt conformational change of a given dimer due to its coupling with the water environment. Scattering of stringy excitations u(x, t) off the defect causes `recoil' of the latter, which starts moving with a velocity vd . The recoil is due to quantum fluctuations as argued in ref. [33]. Such recoil effects are necessary for energy and momentum conservation in the case of (non-relativistic) heavy membranes, considered in ref. [33]. That model represents a pilot model for discussing decoherence due to water environment in our case. The important feature to notice is that the `effective mass' of the defect in such a stringy representation turns out to be inverssely proprotional to the string-coupling constant gs [33],  mdef ect = (8 2gs )-1 (43)

which, in turn, depends on the vacuum expectation value of the effective `dilaton' field : gs = e-<> . In the case at hand, as discussed in ref. [5], the dilaton field is proprotional to the friction coefficient , so that gs  exp(-) in order of magnitude. Strong friction, therefore, between water molecules and dimers, which may be assumed in our physical model of MT, implies weak string coupling, and hence the non-relativistic approximation for the membranes proves sufficient. Within the framework of identifying target time with the Liouville mode [7], then, the analysis of [33] has shown that the quantum recoil degrees of freedom of the membrane defect carry information and induce decoherence of the dimer (string) subsystem, corresponding to violations of conformal invariance of order:
2  recoil  O(vd /16gs Ms )

(44)

2 where vd is the recoil velocity of the defect. By energy-momentum conservation, the kinetic energy of the recoiling (non-relativistic) defect is at most of the same order as the kinetic energy of the displacement field (42). This would yield a lower bound on the decoherence time (8) estimated on the basis of (44) to be of order:

for a moderately long MT, with N = 102 dimers. This is the time scale over which solitonic coherent pointer states in the MT dimer system are formed (`pumped'), according to our scenario. Note that the scale (45) is not far from the original Fr¨hlich scale [2], 10-11 - 10-12 sec. o To answer the question whether quantum coherent pointer states are responsible for loss-free energy transport across the MT one should examine the time scale of the decoherence induced by the coupling of the MT to their biological environment as a consequence of dissipation through the walls of the MT cylinders. Such an ordinary environmental entanglement has been ignored in the derivation of (45). It is this environment that will induce decoherence and eventual collapse of the pointer states formed by the interaction of the dimers with the coherent modes in the ordered water. Using typical numbers of MT networks, we can estimate this decoherence time in a way similar to the corresponding situation in atomic physics (26,30): Tr tcollapse = (46) N n2 t 0 2nN sin2  where we took into account that the dominant (dimer)-(dipole quanta) coupling occurs for ordered-water `cavity' modes which are almost at resonance with the dimer oscillators (c.f. (36),(1)), slightly detuned by  : 0 / << 1, c.f. (40). We also assume that a typical coherent mode of dipole/quanta contains an average of n = O(1) - O(10) oscillator quanta. The macroscopic character of the Schr¨dinger's cat dimer-dipole-quanta system comes from the N dimers in a MT (or o Nmt N in MT networks) [5]. The time t appearing in (46) represents the `time' of interaction of the dimer system with the dipole quanta. A reasonable estimate of this time scale in our MT

towdecoh > 10-10 sec 

(45)

case can be obtained by equating it with the average life-time of a coherent dipolequantum state, which, in the super-radiance model of ref. [19] can be estimated as c¯ 2 V h t (47) 4d2 Nw L ej with dej the electric dipole moment of a water molecule, L the length of the MT, and Nw the number of water molecules in the volume V of the MT. For typical values of the parameters for moderately long MT, L  10-6 m, Nw  108 , a typical value of t is: t  10-4 sec (48) We remark at this point that this is considerably larger than the average life-time of a coherent dipole quantum state in the water model of ref. [17]. Indeed in that model, the corresponding life-time is estimated to be: t  2/0

(49)

where 0  1/I, is a typical frequency of resonating electromagnetic mode in the ordered water. For a typical value of the water molecule moment of intertia [17] this yields a time-scale associated with the coherent interaction O(10-14 sec). The time scale Tr , over which a cavity MT dissipates its energy, can be identified in our model with the average life-time (47) of a coherent-dipole quantum state: Tr  t  10-4 sec (50)

which leads to a naive estimate of the quality factor for the MT cavities, QM T  c Tr  O(108 ). We note, for comparison, that high-quality cavities encountered in Rydberg atom experiments dissipate energy in time scales of O(10-3)-O(10-4 ) sec, and have Q's which are comparable to QM T above. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that conditions like (50), characterizing MT cavities, are met in Nature. From (46), (39), and (50), one then obtains the following estimate for the collapse time of the kink coherent state of the MT dimers due to dissipation: tcollapse  O(10-7) - O(10-6 ) sec (51)

which is larger or equal than the Fr¨hlich scale (5) required for energy transport o across the MT by an average kink soliton in the model of ref. [4]. The result (51), then, implies that Quantum Physics may be responsible for dissipationless energy transfer across the MT. We close this section by remarking that if the condition Tcollapse > 5 × 10-7 sec  is not met, then the above picture, based on mesoscopic coherent states, would be inconsistent with energy-loss free energy transport, since decoherence due to environmental entanglement would occur before energy could be transported across the MT by the preformed quantum soliton. In such a case energy would be transported due to different mechanisms, one of which is the classical solitons scenario of ref. [4, 3]. However, even in such cases of fast decoherence, the Rabi coupling predicted above could still exist and be subjected to experimental verification.

Outlook: Possible Experimental Tests Using MicroTubules as Cavities

In the present work we have put forward a conjecture concerning the representation of the MT arrangements inside the cell as isolated high-Q(uality) cavities. We presented a scenario according to which the presence of the ordered water in the interior of the cylindrical arrangements results in the appearance of electric dipole quantum coherent modes, which couple to the unpaired electrons of the MT dimers via Rabi vacuum field couplings, familiar from the physics of Rydberg atoms in electromagnetic cavities [20]. In quantum optics, such couplings are considered as experimental proof of the quantized nature of the electromagnetic radiation. In our case, therefore, if present, such couplings could indicate the existence of the coherent quantum modes of electric dipole quanta in the ordered water environment of MT, conjectured in ref. [18, 17], and used in the present work. Some generic decoherence time estimates, due to environmental entanglement of the MT cavities, have been given. The conclusion was that only in fairly isolated cavities, which we conjecture exist inside the biological cells, decoherence occurs in time scales which are in agreement with the Fr¨hlich scale ( 5×10-7 sec) for energy o transfer across the MT via the formation of kink solitonic structures. In such a case, dissipationless energy transfer might occur in biological systems, an in particular in MT which are the substratum of cells, in much the same way as frictionless electric current transport occurs in superconductors, i.e. via quantum coherent modes that extend over relatively large spatial regions. A phenomenological analysis indicated that for moderately long MT networks such a situation could be met if the MT cavities dissipate energy in time scales of order Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec. This lower bound is comparable to the corresponding scales of atomic cavities [21],  10-4 sec, which, in turn, implies that the above scenaria, on dissipationless energy transport as a result of the formation of quantum coherent states, have a good chance of being realized at the scales of MT, which are comparable to those in Atomic Physics. We have conjectured in this work that an indirect verification of such a mechanism would be the experimental detection of the aforementioned Vacuum field Rabi coupling, M T , between the MT dimers and the ordered water quantum coherent modes. This coupling, if present, could be tested experimentally by the same methods used to measure VFRS in atomic physics [21], i.e. by using the MT themsleves as cavity environments, and considering tuneable probes to excite the coupled dimerwater system. Such probes could be pulses of (monochromatic ) light, for example, passing through the hollow cylinders of the MT. This would be the analogue of an external field in the atomic experiments described above, which would then resonate, not at the bare frequencies of the coherent dipole quanta or dimers, but at the Rabi splitted ones, and this would have been exhibited by a double pick in the absorption spectra of the dimers [21]. By using MT of different sizes one could thus check on  the characteristic N -enhancement of the Rabi coupling for MT systems with N dimers.

The technical complications that might arise in such experiments are associated with the absence of completely resonant cavities in practice. In fact, from our discussion in this article, one should expect a slight detuning  between the cavity mode and the dimer, of frequency 0 . As discussed in section 3, the detuning produces a split of the vacuum-Rabi doublet into a cavity line 0 + 2 / and an `atomic line' 0 -2 /. In atomic physics there are well established experiments [21, 22] to detect such splittings. In fact, detection of such lines is considered as a very efficient way of `quantum non-demolition' measurement [30] for small microwave photon numbers. Such atomic physics experiments, therefore, may be used as a guide in performing the corresponding biological experiments involving MT (as cavities), as suggested in the present work. We believe that such experimental set-ups will help in sheding some light on the issue of the quantum mechanical nature of the MT arrangements, and even on the processes of the transmission of electric signals (stimuli) by the neuronic systems. Clearly much more work needs to be done before even tentative conclusions are reached, concerning the nature of the MT arrangements. However, we believe that the present work constitutes a useful addition to the programme of understanding the nature of the MT arrangements inside the cell, and the associated processes of energy transfer across the cells.

On Quantum Mechanical Aspects of Microtubules
N.E. Mavromatosa and D.V. Nanopoulosb,c,d Abstract
We discuss possible quantum mechanical aspects of MicroTubules (MT), based on recent developments in quantum physics. We focus on potential mechanisms for `energyloss-free' transport along the microtubules, which could be considered as realizations of Fr¨hlich's ideas on the r^le of solitons for superconductivity and/or biological matter. In o o particular, by representing the MT arrangements as cavities, we present a novel scenario on the formation of macroscopic (or mesoscopic) quantum-coherent states, as a result of the (quantum-electromagnetic) interactions of the MT dimers with the surrounding molecules of the ordered water in the interior of the MT cylinders. Such states decohere due to dissipation through the walls of the MT. Transfer of energy without dissipation, due to such coherent modes, could occur only if the decoherence time is larger than the average time scale required for energy transfer across the cells. We present some generic order of magnitude estimates of the decoherence time in a typical model for MT dynamics. Our conclusion is that the quantum coherent states play a r^le in energy transfer if the dissipao tion through the walls of the MT cavities is fairly suppressed, corresponding to damping time scales Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec, for moderately large MT networks. We suggest specific experiments to test the above-conjectured quantum nature of the microtubular arrangements inside the cell. These experiments are similar in nature to those in atomic physics, used in the detection of the Rabi-Vacuum coupling between coherent cavity modes and atoms. Our conjecture is that a similar Rabi-Vacuum-splitting phenomenon occurs in the absorption (or emission) spectra of the MT dimers, which would constitute a manifestation of the dimer coupling with the coherent modes in the ordered-water environment (dipole quanta), which emerge due to `super-radiance'.

Introduction

MicroTubules (MT) appear to be one of the most fundamental structures of the interior of living cells [1]. These are paracrystalline cytoskeletal structures which seem to play a fundamental r^le for the cell mitosis. It is also believed that they o play an important r^le for the transfer of electric signals and, more general, of energy o in the cell. In this latter respect it should be mentioned that energy transfer across the cells, without dissipation, had been conjectured to occur in biological matter by Fr¨hlich [2], already some time ago. The phenomenon conjectured by Fr¨hlich was o o based on his one-dimensional superconductivity model: in one dimensional electron systems with holes, the formation of solitonic structures due to electron-hole pairing results in the transfer of electric current without dissipation. In a similar manner, Fr¨hlich conjectured that energy in biological matter could be transfered without o dissipation, if appropriate solitonic structures are formed inside the cells. This idea has lead theorists to construct various models for the energy transfer across the cell, based on the formation of kink classical solutions [3]. In the early works no specific microscopic models had been considered [3]. Recently, however, after the identification of the MT as one of the most important structures of the cell, both functionally and structurally, a model for their dynamics has been presented in ref. [4], in which the formation of solitonic structures, and their r^le in energy transfer across the MT, is discussed in terms of classical physics. o In ref. [5] we have considered the quantum aspects of this one-dimensional model, and argued on the consistent quantization of the soliton solutions, as well as the fact that such semiclassical solutions may emerge as a result of `decoherence' due to environmental entanglement, according to recent ideas [6]. The basic assumption of the model used in ref. [5] was that the fundamental structures in the MT (more specifically of the brain MT) are Ising spin chains (one-space-dimensional structures). The interaction of each chain with the neighboring chains and the surrounding water environment had been mimicked by suitable potential terms in the one-dimensional Hamiltonian. The model describing the dynamics of such one-dimensional sub-structures was the ferroelectric distortive spin chain model of ref. [4]. The one-dimensional nature of these fundamental building blocks, then, opens up the way for a mathematical formulation of the chain as a completely intergrable field theory model, characterized by an infinite-number of conservation laws. The latter are associated with global excitation modes, completely delocalised in the chain space-time. This integrability structure proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity [5]. Such features might turn out to be important for a model of the brain as a quantum computer. This formulation allowed the authors of ref. [5] to employ the so-called Liouville (non-critical) string theory approach to decoherence [7], which is a formalism to treat such completely integrable spin systems embedded in a `two-dimensional quantum gravity environment'. At this point we should stress that such an environment

does not necessarily represent realistic space-time effects. As stressed in ref. [5], an external stimulus may distort the neighboring space-time of the unpaired spins of the MT dimers, and such a distortion may be effectively described by a two-dimensional `metric' in the Liouville picture of MT [5], which should not be necessarily identified with a relatistic four dimensional space time metric 1 . The coupling of the MT chain with its `environment' may lead, according to the analysis of ref. [5], to the formation of macroscopic quantum coherent solitonic states. Then, the details of the environment would play a crucial r^le in determining o the time scales over which such coherent states could be sustained before collapsing to classical ground states. Such analyses have yield important results in the past [10, 11, 6, 12], concerning the passage from the quantum to classical world. In particular, in ref. [6] it was suggested that quantum coherent states may appear as a result of decoherence, depending on the nature of the environment [13]. Such states are minimum entropy/uncertainty states, which propagate `almost classically' in time, in the sense that their shape is retained during evolution. Such `almost classical' states are termed `pointer states' by Zurek [6]. In view of the results of ref. [12], concerning the localization of the wave function in open (stochastic) quantum-mechanical systems, the emergence of pointer states, as a result of decoherence, may be interpreted as implying that the localization process of the state vector had stopped at a stage where it is not complete, but is such that the resulting (minimum-entropy) state is least susceptible to the effects of the environment. Not all environments admit such pointer states [13]. Here lies one of the advantages of viewing the MT system of chains as a completely integrable Liouville-string theory. The model possesses a pointer basis [14], which in ref. [5] has been identified with the quantized (via squeezed-coherent states) soliton solutions of ref. [4]. Another advantage lies on the fact that energy is conserved on the average in the model, despite the environmental entanglement. This is for purely stringy reasons pertaining to the Liouville approach. The reader may find details in ref. [7]. Physically this means that such a formalism is capable of describing energy-loss-free transport in biological cells, thereby providing a realization of Fr¨hlich's ideas [2]. o In this article we focus our attention on the microscopic nature of such coherent states, and try to understand their emergence by as much `conventional' physics arguments as possible. By `conventional' we mean scenaria based on quantum electrodynamics, which are the major interactions expected to dominate at the energy scales of the MT 2 . We make an attempt to pick up possible sources of decoherence,
It is however, possible, that such a distortion involves a sufficient movement of mass so as to create a virtual microscopic singularity in the surrounding space time [8, 9, 5]; this could then cause collapse of the macroscopic quantum state, leading to conscious perception. Such daring assumptions/conjectures have gain some support by the fact that in certain physical models of MT dynamics [5] the estimated time of collapse is of order O(1 sec), which is in excellent qualitative agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings in Neurobiology. In the present work we shall not discuss these issues. 2 According to the above discussion, then, quantum gravity entanglement could be, if at all, important for the decoherence of the coherent state formed as a result of the water-dimer coupling.

consistent with the above-mentioned energy-loss-free transfer scenario in biological cells, and estimate the associated time scales. The structure of this article is a follows: in section 2 we review briefly the physical one-dimensional model describing MT dynamics, and discuss briefly the mathematical background for obtaining solitonic structures. An important r^le for o the existence of the solitonic structures is played by the ordered water in the interior of the MT. The importance of the water in the interior of the MT has been emphasized by S. Hameroff, in connection with information processing, already some time ago [15, 16]. In our article we present a scenario for the formation of electric-dipole quantum coherent modes in the water of the MT, inspired by earlier suggestions on `laser-like' behaviour of the water [17, 18, 19]. Such coherent modes couple with the unpaired electrons of the MT dimers. In this work we conjecture that such a coupling would result in the so-called Vacuum Field Rabi Splitting (VFRS) [20], a sort of dynamical Stark effect occuring in the emission or absorption spectra of the dimers as a result of the vaccum quantum fluctuations. This phenomenon is characteristic of the behaviour of atoms inside quantum electrodynamical cavities, the r^le of which is played in our work by the o MT cylindrical structures themselves. A review of this phenomenon in the atomic physics is given in section 3. The atomic Rabi Splitting is a consequence of the coupling of the atoms with the coherent modes of electromagnetic radiation inside the cavity. It is considered by many as a `proof' of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation [20]. In our work, we consider this phenomenon, if true, as a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of the MT arrangement inside the cell. This is discussed in section 4, where we present a scenario according to which the MT arrangements inside the cell act as fairly isolated cavities. The ordered-water molecules in their interior, then, provides an environment, necessary to form coherent quantum modes (dipole quanta) [17, 18, 19], whose coupling with the dimers results in VFRS in the respective absorption spectra. Due to dissipation from the cavity walls, there is decoherence of the combined dimer-cavity system coherent state. The resulting decoherence time scales are estimated, for various sources of envirnoments. The main conclusion of our analysis is that in order for the quantum coherent states to play a r^le in dissipationless energy transfer, i.e. the decoherence o time to be larger than the the scale required for energy transfer in MT - estimated to be of O(5 × 10-7 sec), for a moderately long MT, in the model of ref. [4] - the damping time scales of the MT cavities must be Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec. Finally, in section 5, we present our conclusions and suggest some epxeriments to test the above-conjectured quantum mechanical origin of MT arrangements inside the cell. The experiments are inspired by the physics of Rydberg atoms in
However this would require extreme isolation of the MT system, so that any conventional decoherence due to ordinary environmental entanglement is suppressed. Such isolated MT subsystems have been conjectured to occur in certain parts of brain, in which case quantum gravity plays a r^le in consciousness by inducing a collapse of the coherent-state of the MT dimers [5, 8, 9]. At o present, we do not know whether this is feasible inside the brain.

Review of the Physical Model for Microtubule Dynamics
Classical Considerations

MicroTubules (MT) are hollow cylinders comprised of an exterior surface (of crosssection diameter 25 nm) with 13 arrays (protofilaments) of protein dimers called tubulines. The interior of the cylinder (of cross-section diameter 14 nm) contains ordered water molecules, which implies the existence of an electric dipole moment and an electric field. The arrangement of the dimers is such that, if one ignores their size, they resemble triangular lattices on the MT surface. Each dimer consists of two hydrophobic protein pockets, and has an unpaired electron. There are two possible positions of the electron, called  and  conformations. When the electron is in the -conformation there is a 29o distortion of the electric dipole moment as compared to the  conformation. In standard models for the simulation of the MT dynamics, the `physical' degree of freedom - relevant for the description of the energy transfer - is the projection of the electric dipole moment on the longitudinal symmetry axis (x-axis) of the MT cylinder. The 29o distortion of the -conformation leads to a displacement un along the x-axis, which is thus the relevant physical degree of freedom. This way, the effective system is one-dimensional (spatial), and one has the possibility of a quantum integrable system [5]. Information processing occurs via interactions among the MT protofilament chains. The system may be considered as similar to a model of interacting Ising chains on a trinagular lattice, the latter being defined on the plane stemming from fileting open and flatening the cylindrical surface of MT. Classically, the various dimers can occur in either  or  conformations. Each dimer is influenced by the neighboring dimers resulting in the possibility of a transition. This is the basis for classical information processing, which constitutes the picture of a (classical) cellular automatum. The quantum computer character of the MT network results from the assumption that each dimer finds itself in a superposition of  and  conformations [8]. Viewed as a two-state quantum mechanical system, the MT tubulin dimers couple to conformational changes with 10-9 - 10-11 sec transitions, corresponding to an angular frequency   O(1010 )-O(1012 ) Hz. In the present work we assume the upper bound of this frequency range to represent (in order of magnitude) the characteristic frequency of the dimers, viewed as a two-state quantum-mechanical system: 0  O(1012 ) Hz (1)

The scenario for quantum computation in MT presuposes that there exists a macroscopic coherent state among the various chains. Let us now try to understand

its emergence. Let un be the displacement field of the n-th dimer in a MT chain. The continuous approximation proves sufficient for the study of phenomena associated with energy transfer in biological cells, and this implies that one can make the replacement un  u(x, t) (2) with x a spatial coordinate along the longitudinal symmetry axis of the MT. There is a time variable t due to fluctuations of the displacements u(x) as a result of the dipole oscillations in the dimers. At this stage, t is viewed as a reversible variable. The effects of the neighboring dimers (including neighboring chains) can be phenomenologically accounted for by an effective potential V (u). In the model of ref. [4] a double-well potential was used, leading to a classical kink solution for the u(x, t) field. More complicated interactions are allowed in the string picture, as explained in ref. [5]. More generic polynomial potential have also been considered in ref. [5]. The effects of the surrounding water molecules can be summarized by a viscuous force term that damps out the dimer oscillations, F = -t u (3)

with  determined phenomenologically at this stage. This friction should be viewed as an environmental effect, which however does not lead to energy dissipation, as a result of the non-trivial solitonic structure of the ground-state and the non-zero constant force due to the electric field. This is a well known result, directly relevant to energy transfer in biological systems [3]. In mathematical terms the effective equation of motion for the relevant field degree of freedom u(x, t) reads: u () + u () = P (u) (4)

where  = x-vt, v is the velocity of the soliton,    [4], and P (u) is a polynomial in u, of a certain degree, stemming from the variations of the potential V (u) describing interactions among the MT chains [5]. In the mathematical literature [23] there has been a classification of solutions of equations of this form. For certain forms of the potential, the solutions include kink solitons that may be responsible for dissipation-free energy transfer in biological cells 3 . A typical propagation velocity
In the `string picture of MT' the various solutions are related [5] by appropriate Renormalization-Scheme changes on the world-sheet of the string (generalizaing appropriately the particle like structures). This is reflected in certain ambiguities in the form of the string potential V (u); what seems to be a unique phenomenological potential in point-like theory, determining various forms of soliton solutions, may not have such a unique interpretation in the completelyintegrable (non-critical) string picture of MT. This suggests that the point-like field theory soliton solutions, discussed above, constitute only a `low-energy' approximation of more complicated (solitonic) ground states of the string. As discussed in the context of Liouville strings in ref. [5], such stringy ground states share similar properties with their point­like theory counterparts as far as dissipation-free energy transfer is concerned.

of the kink solitons of ref. [4] is v  2 m/sec. This implies that for moderately long microtubules, of length L  10-6 m, such kinks transport energy in tF  5 × 10-7 sec (5)

This scale is larger than the time scale that Fr¨hlich had conjectured as correspondo ing to the frequency of the coherent phonons in biological matter (t  10-11 - 10-12 s). In this article, however, we shall keep calling the time (5) the Fr¨hlich scale, o since, upon quantization, the kink soliton solutions of ref. [4] yield quantum coherent states [5] that are very similar to Fr¨hlich's phonons. o Therefore, in the above `phenomenological' approach to the MT physics, the importance of the water environment can be seen formally as follows: were it not for the friction term (3) there would be no stable solitonic structures in the ferroelectric distortive model of ref. [4] 4 .

2.2

Quantum Considerations

Let us attempt a microscopic analysis of the physics underlying the interaction of the water molecules with the dimers of the MT. Our investigation points towards the fact that, as a result of the ordered structure of the water environment, there appear collective coherent modes, which in turn interact with the dimer structures (mainly through the unpaired electrons of the dimers) leading to the formation of a quantum coherent solitonic state that extends over the whole network of MT. According to the idea put forward in ref. [5], following ref. [6], such coherent states should be viewed as the result of decoherence of the dimer system due to its interaction/coupling with the water environment. As we shall argue below, such a coupling could be detected by a phenomenon analogous to what is happening in atoms interacting with coherent modes of the electromagnetic radiation in Cavities, namely the Vacuum-Field Rabi Slitting (VFRS) [20]. Our conjecture is that the interior of MT, full of ordered water molecules, can be viewed as a cavity rather than a wave guide; the cavity structure can be formed by `closing' the ends of the MT, and is a way of providing a fairly isolated system which can sustain coherent modes. This type of environmental entanglement is described in the Liouville framework by the world-sheet renormalization-group -function,  u , of the displacement field, u(x), of the dimers, decribed above. A non-trivial  u = 0 expresses deviations from conformal invariance, as a consequence of environmental entanglement [5]. The -function corresponds to an energy-dependent environmental coupling, since its magnitude depends on the energy of the field u(x) [5]:  u = O[(E/Ms )2 ] (6)

In the (non-critical) Liouville string picture such a coupling is responsible for the appearance of the appropriate `dilaton'-like terms in the world-sheet action, which are essential for consistency of the Liouville string [24, 25, 5].

where Ms is a string scale, characteristic of the problem. The scale Ms acts as an ultraviolet cut-off for the energies of the low-energy field theory obtained from the `string', and its size depends on the details of the subsystem u(x, t) as well as the environment. The Master Equation for the time evolution of the density matrix  of the displacement field u in the Liouville approach reads [7, 5]: t  = i[, H] + i u [, u]Ms (7)

where H is the Hamiltonian of the dimer chain. The decoherence time in this approach is estimated as [5]: tdecoh/Liouv  1 N  u Ms (8)

where N denotes the number of dimers in the MT chain. The time scale (8) is the time over which the solitonic quantum coherent pointer states are formed in the MT networks, as a result of the ordered-water-induced decoherence. We now remark that, in the approach of viewing the MT as cavities, the main source of dissipation will then be the leakage of photons or other coherent modes from the cavity. Its rate can be assumed small for the MT of the brain, otherwise the incoherent mode will dominate. This dissipation constitutes an ordinary environment, which cannot lead to the formation of pointer states, but instead induces eventual collapse of the solitonic states into completely classical ground states. Hence, according to the above discussion, there are two stages when decoherence plays an important r^le. o · (i) The first stage concerns the coupling of the system of dimers with the coherent modes formed in the ordered water. This coupling pertains to a specific environment which induces decoherence in the dimer sub-system. producing quantum coherent states (`pointer states') according to refs. [6, 5]. The time scale of this decoherence corresponds to the time scale necessary for the formation of the solitonic coherent states of ref. [5], see eq. (8) above. · (ii) The second stage refers to the decoherence due to ordinary dissipation through the walls of the (imperfect) MT cavities. Such an ordinary environment does not admit a pointer basis [13], but causes collapse of the quantum coherent state of stage (i) down to a classical ground state. In this article, we shall estimate the decoherence time scales of both stages (i) and (ii) and compare them with the Fr¨hlich scale. Moreover, we shall propose o specific experimental tests for the detection of the quantum-mechanical behaviour of the MT arrangements inside the cell. An important feature of all these tests is, as we mentioned previously, the Vacuum-Field Rabi Splitting phenomenon, to a brief description of which we now turn for instructive purposes.

On the Rabi Splitting in Atomic Physics and the Quantum Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation
Description of the Rabi splitting phenomenon

3.1

In this section we shall recapitulate briefly the VFRS in atomic physics. This phenomenon has been predicted for the emission spectra of atoms inside electromagnetic cavities [20], in an attempt to understand the quantized nature of the electromagnetic radiation. The basic principle underlying the phenomenon is that, in the presence of an interaction among two oscillators in resonance, the frequency degeneracy is removed by an amount proportional to the strength of the coupling. In the cavity QED case of ref. [20], one oscillator consists of a small collection of N atoms, whilst the other is a resonant mode of a high-Q(uality) cavity 5 . Immediately after the suggestion of ref. [20], a similar phenomenon has been predicted for absorption spectra of atoms in cavities [27]. By now, the situation has been verified experimentally on a number of occasions [21]. In such experiments one excites the coupled atom-cavity system by a tuneable field probe. The excitation is then found resonant not at the `bare' atom or cavity frequencies but at the split frequencies of the `dressed' atom-field system. The spliting is enhanced for collections of atoms. For instance, as we shall review below, for a system of N atoms, the split is predicted to be [27]:  2 = Rabi splitting of a single atom (9) Rabi splitting = 2 N Despite its theoretical prediction by means of quantum mechanical oscillator systems coupled with a quantized radiation field mode in a cavity, at present there seems to be still a debate on the nature of the phenomenon: (i) the dominant opinion is that the Rabi splitting is a manifestation of the quantum nature of the electromagnetic radiation (cavity field), and is caused as a result of an entanglement between the atom and the cavity coherent modes of radiation. It is a sort of Stark effect, but here it occurs in the absence of an external field [20]. This `dynamical Stark effect' is responsible for a splitting of the resonant lines of the atoms by an amount proportional to the collective atomic-dipole amplitude. (ii) there is however a dual interpretation [28], which claims that the splitting can be observed in optical cavities as well, and it is simply a result of classical wave mechanics inside the cavity, where the atomic sample behaves as a refractive medium with a complex index, which splits the cavity mode into two components. Irrespectively of this second classical interpretation, one cannot deny the presence of the phenomenon in entangled atom-quantum-coherent mode systems. This is the point of view we shall be taking in this work, in connection with our picture of viewing MT filled with ordered water as cavities. We shall try to make specific
The quantity Q is defined as the ratio of the stored-energy to the energy-loss per period [26], by making the analogy with a damped harmonic oscillator.

experimental predictions that could shed light in the formation of quantum coherent states, and their eventual decoherence. As mentioned above, the latter could be due to the interaction of the dimer unpaired spins (playing the r^le of the atoms in the o Rabi experiments) with the ordered-water coherent modes (playing the r^le of the o cavity fields). Possible scenaria for the origin of such cavity coherent modes will be described below. Let us first recapitulate briefly the theoretical basis of the Rabi-splitting phenomenon, which will allow the non-expert reader to assess the situation better. We shall present the phenomenon from a point of view that will help us transcribe it directly to the MT case. Consider an atom of a frequency 0 in interaction with a single coherent mode of electromagnetic radiation field of frequency . The relevant Hamiltonian is: H = h0 ¯
i

Siz + ha a + ¯
i

(¯ Si+ a + H.C.) h

(10)

where a , a are the creation and annihilation cavity radiation field modes, Siz ,Si± are the usual spin- 1 operators, and  is the atom-field coupling. The atom-field 2 system is not an isolated system, since there is dissipation due to the interaction of the system with the surrounding world. An important source of dissipation is the leakage of photons from the cavity at some rate . If the rate of dissipation is not too big, then a quantum coherent state can be formed, which would allow the observation of the vacuum-field Rabi oscillations. The density matrix  of the atom-field system obeys a Markov-type master equation for the evolution in time t [27]: i t  = - [H, ] - (a a - 2aa + a a) (11) h ¯  The limit  <<  N guarantees the possibility of the formation of a quantum coherent state, i.e. this limit describes environments that are weakly coupled to the system, and therefore the decoherence times (see below) are very long. In this limit one can concentrate on the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, and make the following (`secular') approximation for their evolution [27]: i (12) t ij = - (Ei - Ej )ij - ij ij h ¯ where ij denotes the damping factor, pertaining to the weak coupling of the atomfield system to the environment. The analysis of ref. [27] pertained to the evaluation of the susceptibility tensor of the system,  , which can be calculated by considering its interaction of the system with an external field of frequency . The absorption spectrum is proportional to Im(). A standard quantum-mechanical computation yields the result [27]: Im() = cos2  - / + 1 + { - 0 + /2 - 2 (2 + 4N2 )1/2 }2 + / sin2  2 + + { - 0 + /2 + 1 (2 + 4N2 )1/2 }2 2 2 -

with   0 - . In the above expression the damping factors ± represent the damping in the equation of motion for the off-diagonal element of the density matrix < 0 ||S,C > where ± are eigenfucntions of H, classified by the eigenvalues of ± the operators S 2 , and S z + a a  C, in particular [27]: S = N/2, and C = 1 - N/2. The expression (13) summarizes the effect of Rabi-vacuum splitting in absorption spectra of atoms: there is a doublet structure (splitting) of the absorption spectrum with peaks at: 1  = 0 - /2 ± (2 + 4N2 )1/2 (14) 2 For resonant cavities the splitting occurs with equal weights   = 0 ±  N (15) Notice here the enhancement in the effect for multi-atom systems N >> 1. This is the `Vacuum Field Rabi Splitting phenomenon', predicted in emission spectra in ref. [20]. As we have already mentioned, the above derivation pertains to absorption spectra, where the situation is formally much simpler [27]. It is also this latter case that is of interest to  for the purposes of this work. us The quantity 2 N is called the `Rabi frequency' [20]. From the emissionspectrum theoretical analysis an estimate of  may be inferrred which involves the matrix element, d, of atomic electric dipole between the energy states of the two-level atom [20]: Evac d.

As mentioned above, there are simple experiments which confirmed this effect [21], involving beams of Rydberg atoms resonantly coupled to superconducting cavities.

Schr¨dinger's cats in the laboratory, i.e. macro(meso)scopic combinations `measuro ing apparatus + atoms' to verify decoherence experimentally. The first experiment of this sort, which confirms theoretical expectations, is described in ref. [29]. Another important issue, which has been used above, and in ref. [29], is the dephasing of the atom as a result of the above-described atom-field Rabi entanglement. To understand better the situation, let us discuss a more generic case, that of a three-state atom, f, e, g, with energies Eg > Ee > Ef . Suppose one is interested in the transition f  e by absorption, in the presence of atoms in interaction with + - + a cavity mode. Calling Def  |e >< f |,Def  |f >< e| = (Def ) , we have the effective Hamiltonian for the transition f  e [30]:

where the `effective' frequency ef f incorporates the dispersive frequency shifts (18) of the Rabi effect, appropriate for near-resonant atom-cavity-field systems; n is the number of cavity photons 7 . Consider now an experiment to measure, say, the photon number n in the cavity. The relevant probe P can be the above-described three-state atom, in a superposition of e and f states. In this picture the photon number n is an eigenvalue of the cavity signal operator a as ; the interaction Hamiltonian between atom and cavity then s reads [30]: h2  ¯ + - HI = a as Def Def (20)  s The probe observable is the atomic dipole operator: AP = 1 + - (D - Def ) 2i ef (21)

from which it is easily seen that in a time interval t the phase of the probe is changing by: 2 n  = ef t + t (23)  The case of interest for the experiment of ref. [29] is a two-state atom; the resulting phase shift is then obtained from (23) by setting ef = 0. In that case, the phase entanglement due to the atom-field Rabi coupling is R =

[29], which will constitute our prototype for the extension of the above results to the MT case. Before doing so it is instructive to review briefly the experiment of [29], where decoherence of an open mesoscopic system (`Schr¨dinger's cat') has been demonstrated. o

Rabi splitting and decoherence: experimenal verification

The experiment consists of sending a Rubidium atom with two circular Rydberg states e and g, through a microwave cavity storing a small coherent field | >. The coherent cavity mode is mesoscopic in the sense of possessing an average number of photons of order O(10). The atom-cavity coupling is measured by the Rabi frequency 2/2 = 48 kHz. The condition for Rabi dispersive shifts (18) is satisfied by having a /2  [70, 800] kHz. The set up of the experiment is as follows: The atom is prepared in the superposition of e, g states, by virtue of a resonant microwave cavity R1 . Then it crosses the cavity C, which is coupled to a reservoir that damps its energy (dissipation) at a characteristic time scale Tr << 1.5.ms. Typical cavities, used for atomic scale experiments such as the above, have dimensions which lie in the mm range or at most cm range. In the cavity C a number of photons varying from 0 to 10 is injected by a pulse source. The field in the cavity relaxes to vacuum - thereby causing dissipation through leakeage of photons through the cavity - during a time Tr , before being regenerated for the next atom. The experiment is at an effective temperature of T = 0.6K, which is low enough so as to minimize thermal effects. After leaving C, the atom passes through a second cavity R2 , identical to R1 ; one then measures the probability of finding the atom in the state, say, g. This would mean decoherence. The decoherence time is measured for various photon numbers; this helps testing the theoretical predictions that decoherence between two `pointer states' of a quantum superposition occurs at a rate proportional to the square of the distance among the states [31, 32, 6, 11]. Let us understand this latter point better. The coherent oscillator states, characterizing the cavity modes, constitute such a pointer basis: an oscillator in a coherent  state is defined by the average number of oscillator quanta n as: | >: || = n. Then, consider the measurement of the above-described experiment, according to which there is only a phase entanglement between the cavity and the atom: the combined atom-cavity (meter) system is originally in the state | >= |e, ei > +|g, e-i > (25)

According to (24) the dephasing is atomic-level dependent   2 tn/. Coupling the oscillator to a reservoir, that damps its energy in a characteristic time scale Tr , produces decoherence. According to the general theory [10, 32, 30, 31] the latter occurs during a time scale inversely proportional to the square of the distance

between the `pointer' states D 2 : tcollapse = 2Tr D2 (26)

This is easy to verify in a prototype toy model, involving only a phase entanglement, i.e. without energy dissipation. To this end, consider the Hamiltonian: H = ha a + a a ¯ (27)

with a , a creation and annihilation operators of a quantum oscillator, and  a phase damping. The `pointer' states for this problem are characterized by the eigenvalues n of the number operator a a which commutes with the Hamiltonian [a a , H] = 0, i.e. the pointer basis is {|n >}. The pertinent Markov master equation for the density matrix, , reads: t  =   (2a aa a - a aa a - a aa a) 2 (28)

Writing (t) = m,n mn (t)|n >< m| it is straightforward to determine the time dependence of nm (t) from (28) nm (t) = e-(n-m)
2 t/2

nm (0)

(29)

which implies that the coherence between two different (m = n) pointer (number) 1 states is damped at a typical scale given by (26), where Tr =  , and the distance D is given by n - m in the above example . As mentioned previously, this inverse D 2 -behaviour seems to be a generic feature of open (decohering) systems, including open string models [7, 5]. In the set up of ref. [29] the distance D is given by  2 t D = 2 nsin  2n3/2  (30)

for Rabi couplings 2, such that 2 tn << . For mesoscopic systems n  10, D > 1, and, hence, decoherence occurs over a much shorter time scale than Tr ; in particular, for /2  70kHz the decoherence time is 0.24Tr [29]. This concludes the construction of a Schr¨dinger's cat, and the associated `measurement process'. Noo tice that the above construction is made in two stages: first it involves an interaction of the atom with the cavity field, which results in a coherent state of the combined `atom-meter', and then dissipation is induced by coupling the cavity (measuring apparatus) to the environment, which damps its energy, thereby inducing decoherence in the `atom+meter' system. The important point to realize is that the more macroscopic the cavity mode is (i.e. the higher the number of oscillator quanta), the shorter the decoherence time is. This is exactly what was to be expected from the general theory [6, 10, 11, 7].

4.1

Rabi Vacuum Coupling in MT and Energy Transfer in the Cell
Microscopic Mechanisms for the formation of Coherent States in MT

Above we have sketched the experimental construction of a mesoscopic quantum coherent state (a `Schr¨dinger's cat' (SC)). The entanglement of the atom with the o coherent cavity mode, manifested experimentally by the `vacuum Rabi splitiing', leads to a quantum-coherent state for the combined atom-cavity system (SC), comprising of the superposition of the states of the two-level Rydberg atom. Dissipation induced by the leakage of photons in the cavity leads to decoherence of the coherent atom-cavity state, in a time scale given by (26). This time scale depends crucially on the nature of the coupled system, and the nature of the `environment'. It is the point of this session to attempt to discuss a similar situation that conjecturally occurs in the systems of MT. We believe that understanding the formation of Schr´dinger's o cats in MT networks will unravel, if true, the mysteries of the brain as a (quantum) computer, which might also be related to the important issue of `conscious perception', as advocated in refs. [9, 8, 5]. The first issue concerns the nature of the `cavity-field modes'. Our point in this section is to argue that the presence of ordered water, which seems to occupy the interior of the microtubules [16], plays an important r^le in producing coherent o modes, which resemble those of the ordinary electromagnetic field in superconducting cavities, discussed above. Let us first review briefly some suggestions about the r^le of the electric dipole o moment of water molecules in producing coherent modes after coupling with the electromagnetic radiation field [17]. Such a coupling implies a `laser-like' behaviour. Although it is not clear to us whether such a behaviour characterizes ordinary water, in fact we believe it does not due to the strong suppression of such couplings in the disordered ordinary water, however it is quite plausible that such a behaviour characterizes the ordered water molecules that exist in the interior of MT [16]. If true, then this electric dipole-quantum radiation coupling will be responsible, according to the analysis of ref. [17], for the appearance of collective quantum coherent modes. The Hamiltonian used in the theoretical model of ref. [17] is:
M

How =

[
j=1

1 2 L + A.dej ] 2I j

(31)

where A is the quantized electromagnetic field in the radiation gauge [17], M is the number of water molecules, Lj is the total angular momentum vector of a single molecule, I is the associated (average) moment of inertia, and dej is the electric dipole vector of a single molecule, |dej |  2e  de , with de  0.2 Angstr¨m. As a o result of the dipole-radiation interaction in (31) coherent modes emerge, which in ref. [18] have been interpreted as arising from the quantization of the Goldstone

modes responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electric dipole (rotational) symmetry. Such modes are termed `dipole quanta' in ref. [18]. This kind of mechanism has been applied to microtubules [19], with the conclusion that such coherent modes cause `super-radiance', i.e. create a specific quantummechanical ordering in the water molecules with characteristic times much shorter than those of thermal interaction. In addition, the optical medium inside the internal hollow core of the microtubule is made transparent by the coherent photons themselves [19]. Such phenomena, if observed, could verify the coherent-mode emission from living matter, thereby verifying Fr¨hlich's ideas. o In our picture of viewing the MT arrangements as cavities, these coherent modes are the quantum coherent `oscillator' modes of section 3, represented by annihilation and creation operators ac , a , which play the r^le of the cavity modes, if the orderedo c water interior of the MT is viewed as an isolated cavity 8 . The r^le of the small o collection of atoms, described in the atomic physics analogue above, is played in this picture by the protein dimers of the MT chains. The latter constitute a two-state system due to the  and  conformations, defined by the position on the unpaired spin in the dimer pockets. The presence of unpaired electrons is crucial to such an analogy. The interaction of the dipole-quanta coherent modes with the protein dimers results in an entanglement which we claim is responsible for the emergence of soliton quantum coherent states, extending over large scale, e.g. the MT or even the entire MT network. The issue, we are concerned with here, is whether such coherent states are responsible for energy-loss-free transport, as well as for quantum computations due to their eventual collapse, as a result of `environmental' entanglement of the entire `MT dimers + ordered water' system. An explicit construction of such solitonic states has been made in the field-theoretic model for MT dynamics of ref. [5], based on classical ferroelectric models for the displacement field u(x, t) discussed in section 2 [4]. The quantum-mechanical picture described here should be viewed as a simplification of the field-theoretic formalism, which, however, is sufficient for qualitative estimates of the induced decoherence.

4.2

Decoherence and dissipationless energy transfer

To study quantitatively the effects of decoherence in MT systems we make the plaussible assumption that the environmental entanglement of the `ordered-water cavity' (OWC), which is responsible for dissipation, is attributed entirely to the leakage
This was not the picture envisaged in ref. [17]. However, S. Hameroff, as early as 1974, had conjectured the r^le of MT as `dielectric waveguides' for photons [15], and in ref. [19] some o detailed mathematical construction of the emergence of coherent modes out of the ordered water are presented. In our work in this article we consider the implications of such coherent modes for the system of dimers, in particular for the formation of kink solitons of ref. [4]. Thus, our approach is different from that in refs. [17, 19], where attention has been concentrated only on the properties of the water molecules. We should emphasize that the phenomenon of optical transparency due to super-radiance may co-exist with the formation of kink soliton coherent states along the dimer chains, relevant to the dissipation-free energy transfer along the MT, discussed in the present work.

of photons (electromagnetic radiation quanta) from the MT interior of volume V (`cavity'). This leakage may occur from the nodes of the MT network, if one assumes fairly isolated interia. This leakage will cause decoherence of the coherent state of the `MT dimer-OWC' system. The leakage determines the damping time scale Tr in (26). The dimers with their two conformational states , play the r^le of the collection o of N two-level Rydberg atoms in the atomic physics analogue described in section 3. If we now make the assumption that the ordered-water dipole-quantum coherent modes couple to the dimers of the MT chains in a way similar to the one leading to a Rabi splitting, described above, then one may assume a coupling 0 of order: 0  ddimer Eow h ¯ (32)

where ddimer is the single-dimer electric dipole matrix element, associated wiith the transition from the  to the  conformation, and Eow is a r.m.s. typical value of the amplitude of a coherent dipole-quantum field mode. Given that each dimer has a mobile charge [1]: q = 18×2e, e the electron charge, one may estimate ddimer  36 × 0 × 1.6. × 10-19 × 4.10-9  3 × 10-18 Cb × Angstrom  (33)

where we used the fact that a typical distance for the estimate of the electric dipole moment for the `atomic' transition between the ,  conformations is of O(4 nm), i.e. of order of the distance between the two hydrophobic dimer pockets. We also took account of the fact that, as a result of the water environment, the electric charge of the dimers appears to be screened by the relative dielectric constant of the water, /0  80. We note, however, that the biological environment of the unpaired electric charges in the dimer may lead to further suppression of ddimer (33). The amplitude of the collective modes of the dipole-quanta may be estimated using the formula (17). In our case the `cavity volume' is: V  5 × 10-22 m3 (34)

which is a typical MT volume, for a moderately long MT L  10-6 m, considered as an isolated cavity 9 , and c a typical frequency of the dipole quanta collective mode dynamics. To estimate this frequency we assume, following the `super-radiance' model of ref. [19], that the dominant modes are those with frequencies in the
Here we consider only a single unit of the MT network. The MT network consists of a large number of such cavities/MT. Our scenario here is to examine soliton formation in a single (isolated) cavity MT, with the only source of dissipation the leakage of photons. This would explain the formation of kinks in a single MT [4, 5]. If the entire network of MT is viewed as a cavity, then the volume V is complicated, but in that case the volume can be estimated roughly as Nmt V , with V the average volume of each MT, and Nmt the number of MT in the network population. In such a case, the solitonic state extends over the entire network of MT. It is difficult to model such a situation by simple one-dimensional Hamiltonians as in refs. [4, 5].

range c  /¯ , where  is the energy difference between the two principal energy h eigenstates of the water molecule, which are assumed to play the dominant r^le in o the interaction with the (quantized) electromagnetic radiation field. For the water molecule: hc  4 meV ¯ (35) which yields c  /¯  6 × 1012 s-1 h (36) This is of the same order as the characteristic frequency of the dimers (1), implying that the dominant cavity mode and the dimer system are almost in resonance. Note that this is a feature shared by the Atomic Physics systems in Cavities examined in section 3, and thus we may apply the pertinent formalism to our system. From (17) one obtains for the r.m.s Eow in order of magnitude: Eow  104 V/m (37)

where we took into account the relative dielectric constant of water /0  80. It has not escaped our attention that the electric fields of such order of magnitude can be provided by the electromagnetic interactions of the MT dimer chains, the latter viewed as giant electric dipoles [4]. This may be seen to suggest that the superradiance coherent modes c , which in our scenario interact with the unpaired electric charges of the dimers and produce the kink solitons along the chains, owe their existence to the (quantized) electromagnetic interactions of the dimers themselves. We assume that the system of N MT dimers interacts with a single dipolequantum mode of the ordered water and we ignored interactions among the dimer spins 10 . In our work here we concentrate our attention on the formation of a coherent soliton along a single dimer chain, the interactions of the remaining 12 chains in a protofilament MT cylinder being represented by appropriate interaction terms in the effective potential of the chain MT model of ref. [4]. In a moderately long microtubule of length L  10-6 m there are N = L/8  102 (38)

tubulin dimers of average length 8 nm in each chain. Then, from (32), (33), and (37), the conjectured Rabi-vacuum splitting, describing the entanglement of the interior coherent modes with the dimers can be estimated to be of order  Rabi coupling for MT  M T = N 0  3 × 1011 s-1 (39) which is, on average, an order of magnitude smaller than the characteristic frequency of the dimers (1). In this way, the perturbative analysis of section 3, for small Rabi
More complicated situations, including interactions among the dimers, as well as of the dimers with more than one radiation quanta, which might undoubtedly occur in nature, complicate the above estimate.

implying that the condition 2 N /||2 << 1, necessary for the perturbative analysis 0 of section 3, is satisfied. The Rabi frequency (39) corresponds to an energy splitting hM T  0.1 meV for a moderately long MT. ¯ Having estimated the Rabi coupling between the dimers and the ordered-water coherent modes we now proceed to estimate the average time scale necessary for the formation of the pointer coherent states which arise due to this entanglement [6, 5]. This is the same as the decoherence time due to the water-dimer coupling. In such a case one may use the Liouville model of MT [5], discussed in section 2.2, which is known to possess pointer coherent states [14]. The relevant decoherence time scale is given by (8). For an accurate estimate of the decoherence time one should have a precise knowledge of the violations of conformal invariance associated with the water-dimer coupling. Unlike the quantum-gravity induced decoherence case, where a microscopic model for the description of the distortions caused in the environment of the chain by the external stimuli is available [5], at present a precise conformal-fieldtheory model for the description of the water-dimer coupling is lacking. However, for our purposes here, it suffices to use our generic approach to the string-theory representation of MT chains, described in ref. [5], where a good orderof-magnitude estimate for  u is provided by (6). We, therefore, merely need to have an estimate of the scales E and Ms for the problem at hand. To estimate the `string' scale Ms in our case 11 , where only quantum-electromagnetic interactions enter, we notice that in the standard string theory Ms acts as an ultraviolet cut-off in the energy of the effective target-sace field theory, in our case the field theory of the displacement field u(x, t). Since in the ferroelectric chain the closest distance separating two unpaired electrons, which are assumed to have the dominant interactions with the water, is the size of a tubulin dimer  dmin = 4 nm, an order of magnitiude estimate of Ms is: Ms  hv0 /dmin  1.5 × 10-4 eV, ¯ (41)

splittings  << 0 , is valid. Indeed, as can be seen from (1),(36), the detuning  is of order: /0  O(10) - O(100) (40)

where we took into account that the Liouville model for MT in ref. [5] is formally a relativistic string model, but with the r^le of the velocity of light played by the o sound velocity v0 = 1Km/sec in organic biological materials. It is interesting to note that this cut-off in energies is less than the kinetic energies of fast kinks, propagating with the valocity of sound. Indeed such energies are of order E0  10-2 eV. Such fast kinks have been associated in ref. [5] with quantum gravitational effects, due to
In ref. [5], where scenaria for gravity-induced conscious perception were discussed, the scale Ms was taken to be the Planck scale 1019 GeV. In that case decoherence was induced by the coupling of the entire network of brain MT to quantum-gravity fluctuations due to the distortion of the surrounding space time, as result of abrupt conformational changes in the dimers, caused by external stimuli [9, 8, 5].
11

abrupt distortions of space time, and hence their exclusion in the approach of the present work, by considering kinks with energies much less than those, as implied by Ms , is consistent with our considering only electromagnetic interactions among the dimers and its environment. The above estimate allows us to get an idea of the typical energy scales of the excitations of the MT systems that dominate the ordered-water-dimer coupling, in the above scenario, and lead to decoherence. As discussed in ref. [5], the dominant part of the energy of a kink in the model of ref. [4] is of order 1eV, and thus much higher than the Ms (41). Such scales may play a r^le in the decoherence o due to quantum-gravity entanglements [5], which however is much weaker than the electromagnetic ones considered here. On the other hand, as we shall argue now, a typical energy scale for the dimer displacement field u(x, t), much smaller than Ms , and therefore consistent with our low-energy approach, is provided by the kinetic energy of the kink, which is estimated to be of order [4] Ekin  5 × 10-8 eV (42)

As we shall argue below, this energy scale may be used for our estimate of the time scale (8), which is necessary for the formation of the coherent state due to the waterdimer coupling. We stresss that (42) should not be considered as a typical energy scale associated with the excitation spectrum of the dimers, pertaining to the Rabi splitting discussed above. It is rather an `effective scale', characterising `friction' effects between the dimers and the water environment. The latter are responsible [5] for decoherence and the eventual formation of the kink coherent states, which are minimum-entropy states [6], least susceptible to the effects of the water environent. To justify the above estimate, one should notice that the formation of coherent quantum states through decoherence due to friction [6] is the quantum analogue of the `drift velocity' acquired by a Brownian particle in classical mechanics. In the (non-relativistic) conformal-field-theory setting of ref. [5] such a friction could be described by the formation of point-like defects on the dimer chains, which could be described by appropriate non-relativistic membrane backgrounds in the 1 + 1dimensional string theory representation of the MT dynamics. Such membranes are stringy defects, which, for instance, could describe the result of an abrupt conformational change of a given dimer due to its coupling with the water environment. Scattering of stringy excitations u(x, t) off the defect causes `recoil' of the latter, which starts moving with a velocity vd . The recoil is due to quantum fluctuations as argued in ref. [33]. Such recoil effects are necessary for energy and momentum conservation in the case of (non-relativistic) heavy membranes, considered in ref. [33]. That model represents a pilot model for discussing decoherence due to water environment in our case. The important feature to notice is that the `effective mass' of the defect in such a stringy representation turns out to be inverssely proprotional to the string-coupling constant gs [33],  mdef ect = (8 2gs )-1 (43)

which, in turn, depends on the vacuum expectation value of the effective `dilaton' field : gs = e-<> . In the case at hand, as discussed in ref. [5], the dilaton field is proprotional to the friction coefficient , so that gs  exp(-) in order of magnitude. Strong friction, therefore, between water molecules and dimers, which may be assumed in our physical model of MT, implies weak string coupling, and hence the non-relativistic approximation for the membranes proves sufficient. Within the framework of identifying target time with the Liouville mode [7], then, the analysis of [33] has shown that the quantum recoil degrees of freedom of the membrane defect carry information and induce decoherence of the dimer (string) subsystem, corresponding to violations of conformal invariance of order:
2  recoil  O(vd /16gs Ms )

(44)

2 where vd is the recoil velocity of the defect. By energy-momentum conservation, the kinetic energy of the recoiling (non-relativistic) defect is at most of the same order as the kinetic energy of the displacement field (42). This would yield a lower bound on the decoherence time (8) estimated on the basis of (44) to be of order:

for a moderately long MT, with N = 102 dimers. This is the time scale over which solitonic coherent pointer states in the MT dimer system are formed (`pumped'), according to our scenario. Note that the scale (45) is not far from the original Fr¨hlich scale [2], 10-11 - 10-12 sec. o To answer the question whether quantum coherent pointer states are responsible for loss-free energy transport across the MT one should examine the time scale of the decoherence induced by the coupling of the MT to their biological environment as a consequence of dissipation through the walls of the MT cylinders. Such an ordinary environmental entanglement has been ignored in the derivation of (45). It is this environment that will induce decoherence and eventual collapse of the pointer states formed by the interaction of the dimers with the coherent modes in the ordered water. Using typical numbers of MT networks, we can estimate this decoherence time in a way similar to the corresponding situation in atomic physics (26,30): Tr tcollapse = (46) N n2 t 0 2nN sin2  where we took into account that the dominant (dimer)-(dipole quanta) coupling occurs for ordered-water `cavity' modes which are almost at resonance with the dimer oscillators (c.f. (36),(1)), slightly detuned by  : 0 / << 1, c.f. (40). We also assume that a typical coherent mode of dipole/quanta contains an average of n = O(1) - O(10) oscillator quanta. The macroscopic character of the Schr¨dinger's cat dimer-dipole-quanta system comes from the N dimers in a MT (or o Nmt N in MT networks) [5]. The time t appearing in (46) represents the `time' of interaction of the dimer system with the dipole quanta. A reasonable estimate of this time scale in our MT

towdecoh > 10-10 sec 

(45)

case can be obtained by equating it with the average life-time of a coherent dipolequantum state, which, in the super-radiance model of ref. [19] can be estimated as c¯ 2 V h t (47) 4d2 Nw L ej with dej the electric dipole moment of a water molecule, L the length of the MT, and Nw the number of water molecules in the volume V of the MT. For typical values of the parameters for moderately long MT, L  10-6 m, Nw  108 , a typical value of t is: t  10-4 sec (48) We remark at this point that this is considerably larger than the average life-time of a coherent dipole quantum state in the water model of ref. [17]. Indeed in that model, the corresponding life-time is estimated to be: t  2/0

(49)

where 0  1/I, is a typical frequency of resonating electromagnetic mode in the ordered water. For a typical value of the water molecule moment of intertia [17] this yields a time-scale associated with the coherent interaction O(10-14 sec). The time scale Tr , over which a cavity MT dissipates its energy, can be identified in our model with the average life-time (47) of a coherent-dipole quantum state: Tr  t  10-4 sec (50)

which leads to a naive estimate of the quality factor for the MT cavities, QM T  c Tr  O(108 ). We note, for comparison, that high-quality cavities encountered in Rydberg atom experiments dissipate energy in time scales of O(10-3)-O(10-4 ) sec, and have Q's which are comparable to QM T above. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that conditions like (50), characterizing MT cavities, are met in Nature. From (46), (39), and (50), one then obtains the following estimate for the collapse time of the kink coherent state of the MT dimers due to dissipation: tcollapse  O(10-7) - O(10-6 ) sec (51)

which is larger or equal than the Fr¨hlich scale (5) required for energy transport o across the MT by an average kink soliton in the model of ref. [4]. The result (51), then, implies that Quantum Physics may be responsible for dissipationless energy transfer across the MT. We close this section by remarking that if the condition Tcollapse > 5 × 10-7 sec  is not met, then the above picture, based on mesoscopic coherent states, would be inconsistent with energy-loss free energy transport, since decoherence due to environmental entanglement would occur before energy could be transported across the MT by the preformed quantum soliton. In such a case energy would be transported due to different mechanisms, one of which is the classical solitons scenario of ref. [4, 3]. However, even in such cases of fast decoherence, the Rabi coupling predicted above could still exist and be subjected to experimental verification.

Outlook: Possible Experimental Tests Using MicroTubules as Cavities

In the present work we have put forward a conjecture concerning the representation of the MT arrangements inside the cell as isolated high-Q(uality) cavities. We presented a scenario according to which the presence of the ordered water in the interior of the cylindrical arrangements results in the appearance of electric dipole quantum coherent modes, which couple to the unpaired electrons of the MT dimers via Rabi vacuum field couplings, familiar from the physics of Rydberg atoms in electromagnetic cavities [20]. In quantum optics, such couplings are considered as experimental proof of the quantized nature of the electromagnetic radiation. In our case, therefore, if present, such couplings could indicate the existence of the coherent quantum modes of electric dipole quanta in the ordered water environment of MT, conjectured in ref. [18, 17], and used in the present work. Some generic decoherence time estimates, due to environmental entanglement of the MT cavities, have been given. The conclusion was that only in fairly isolated cavities, which we conjecture exist inside the biological cells, decoherence occurs in time scales which are in agreement with the Fr¨hlich scale ( 5×10-7 sec) for energy o transfer across the MT via the formation of kink solitonic structures. In such a case, dissipationless energy transfer might occur in biological systems, an in particular in MT which are the substratum of cells, in much the same way as frictionless electric current transport occurs in superconductors, i.e. via quantum coherent modes that extend over relatively large spatial regions. A phenomenological analysis indicated that for moderately long MT networks such a situation could be met if the MT cavities dissipate energy in time scales of order Tr  10-4 - 10-5 sec. This lower bound is comparable to the corresponding scales of atomic cavities [21],  10-4 sec, which, in turn, implies that the above scenaria, on dissipationless energy transport as a result of the formation of quantum coherent states, have a good chance of being realized at the scales of MT, which are comparable to those in Atomic Physics. We have conjectured in this work that an indirect verification of such a mechanism would be the experimental detection of the aforementioned Vacuum field Rabi coupling, M T , between the MT dimers and the ordered water quantum coherent modes. This coupling, if present, could be tested experimentally by the same methods used to measure VFRS in atomic physics [21], i.e. by using the MT themsleves as cavity environments, and considering tuneable probes to excite the coupled dimerwater system. Such probes could be pulses of (monochromatic ) light, for example, passing through the hollow cylinders of the MT. This would be the analogue of an external field in the atomic experiments described above, which would then resonate, not at the bare frequencies of the coherent dipole quanta or dimers, but at the Rabi splitted ones, and this would have been exhibited by a double pick in the absorption spectra of the dimers [21]. By using MT of different sizes one could thus check on  the characteristic N -enhancement of the Rabi coupling for MT systems with N dimers.

The technical complications that might arise in such experiments are associated with the absence of completely resonant cavities in practice. In fact, from our discussion in this article, one should expect a slight detuning  between the cavity mode and the dimer, of frequency 0 . As discussed in section 3, the detuning produces a split of the vacuum-Rabi doublet into a cavity line 0 + 2 / and an `atomic line' 0 -2 /. In atomic physics there are well established experiments [21, 22] to detect such splittings. In fact, detection of such lines is considered as a very efficient way of `quantum non-demolition' measurement [30] for small microwave photon numbers. Such atomic physics experiments, therefore, may be used as a guide in performing the corresponding biological experiments involving MT (as cavities), as suggested in the present work. We believe that such experimental set-ups will help in sheding some light on the issue of the quantum mechanical nature of the MT arrangements, and even on the processes of the transmission of electric signals (stimuli) by the neuronic systems. Clearly much more work needs to be done before even tentative conclusions are reached, concerning the nature of the MT arrangements. However, we believe that the present work constitutes a useful addition to the programme of understanding the nature of the MT arrangements inside the cell, and the associated processes of energy transfer across the cells.

A Multiparticle Generalization of Entanglement Swapping
S.Bose, V.Vedral and P.L.Knight
Optics Section, The Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, England (February 1, 2008) We generalize the procedure of entanglement swapping to obtain a scheme for manipulating entanglement in multiparticle systems. We describe how this scheme allows to establish multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to distant users in a communication network through a prior distribution of singlets followed by only local measurements. We show that this scheme can be regarded as a method of generating entangled states of many particles and compare it with existing schemes using simple quantum computational networks. We highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement swappings during the distribution of entangled particles between two parties. Applications of multiparticle entangled states in cryptographic conferencing and in reading messages from more than one source through a single measurement are also described. Pacs Nos: 03.65.Bz

I. INTRODUCTION

There are numerous uses of spatially separated entangled pairs of particles such as cryptography based on Bell's theorem [1], teleportation [2], superdense coding [3], cheating bit commitment [4] and, of course, simply testing Bell's inequalities [5,6]. It is natural to expect that three or more spatially separated particles in an entangled state (such as a GHZ state [7]) will have varied applications as well. A well known application is in testing nonlocality from new directions [7­9]. More recently, applications such as reducing communication complexity [10] and quantum telecomputation [11] have been suggested. An idea of cryptography with GHZ states [12] has also been suggested earlier. This essentially means that multiparticle entangled states present possibilities of implementing networked cryptographic conferencing [13,14] in an alternative way and we shall elaborate briefly on this aspect in section VI of this article. In addition, we shall show (by generalizing superdense coding [3] to the multiparticle case), that the use of multiparticle entangled states can allow one to read messages from more than one source through a single measurement. In short, distributed entangled particles in a multiparticle entangled state may be extremely useful for certain forms of quantum communication. Hence it will become necessary to distribute entangled N-tuplets between nodes of communication networks if any set of users of the network wish to harness the benefits of these forms of quantum communication. The prime focus of this paper is to present a method of manipulating entanglement in multiparticle systems that can accomplish this task by just a local measurement if each of the users share singlets with a central node prior to that. In a sense, it allows one to construct a Biham-Huttner-Mor (BHM) like telephone exchange [14], with the added capability of setting up multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to different users of the network. Our scheme is actually obtained by generalizing an earlier scheme of Zukowski et al [15] known as entanglement 1

swapping to the multiparticle case. Building on an earlier proposal by Yurke and Stoler [16] of entangling particles originating from independent sources, they showed that through entanglement swapping one can entangle particles which do not even share any common past. Their aim was to realize 'event ready detectors' for Bell experiments. In section V we point out two ways in which their original entanglement swapping scheme can come to a practical advantage while distributing entangled particles between two parties. We also point out that our form of multiparticle entanglement manipulation differs from the method proposed recently by Zeilinger et al [17] for the generation of multiparticle entangled states in the application of a few quantum gates and yet can be used for the same purpose. We begin by briefly recapitulating the original entanglement swapping scheme of Zukowski et al [15] in Section.II.
II. THE ENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING SCHEME OF ZUKOWSKI ET AL

In terms of a binary variable ui  {0, 1} and its complement uc (defined as 1 - ui ), one can write down any i Bell state (not normalized) of two particles i and j as |(i, j)
±

= |ui , uj ± |uc , uc . i j

(1)

In the above it is understood that |ui and |uc are two i orthogonal states of a two state system. Consider the initial state of four particles 1,2,3 and 4 to be |(1, 2)
+

 |(3, 4)

+

= |u1 , u2 , u3 , u4 + |uc , uc , u3 , u4 1 2 + |u1 , u2 , uc , uc 3 4 + |uc , uc , uc , uc . 1 2 3 4

(2)

That is, particles 1 and 2 are mutually entangled (in a Bell state), and particles 3 and 4 are mutually entangled (also in a Bell state). When we conduct a measurement of the Bell operator (defined in [6]) on particles 2 and 3

(which projects particles 2 and 3 to a Bell state), then the joint state of the four particles become either of the following four : |1 = (|u2 , u3 + |uc , uc )  (|u1 , u4 + |uc , uc ) , (3a) 2 3 1 4 |2 = (|u2 , u3 - |uc , uc )  (|u1 , u4 - |uc , uc ) , (3b) 2 3 1 4 |3 = (|u2 , uc + |uc , u3 )  (|u1 , uc + |uc , u4 ) , (3c) 3 2 4 1 |4 = (|u2 , uc - |uc , u3 )  (|u1 , uc - |uc , u4 ) . (3d) 2 4 1 3 To derive the above, only the orthogonality of |ui and |uc is required. In other words, no matter what the outi come is, the particles 1 and 4 are now in one of the Bell states . Whereas prior to the measurement, the Bell pairs were (1,2) and (3,4), after the measurement the Bell pairs are (2,3) and (1,4). It can easily be shown that the same fact would hold true even if (1,2) and (3,4) started in some other Bell states than those in Eq.(2). A pictorial way of representing the above process is given in Fig.1.

where a greater number of particles are involved. An explicit scheme that generalizes entanglement swapping to the case of generating a 3-particle GHZ state from three Bell pairs has already been presented by Zukowski et al [18]. But it should be interesting to demonstrate that their entanglement swapping scheme may actually be significantly generalized to the case of starting with cat states involving any number of particles, doing local measurements by selecting any number of particles from the different cat states and also ending up with cat states involving any number of particles ( The cat state is a terminology used to refer to generalizations of Bell states and GHZ states to higher number of particles). To see that consider an initial state in which there are N different sets of entangled particles in cat states. Let each of these sets be labelled by m (where m = 1, 2, .., N ), the ith particle of the mth set be labelled by i(m) and the total number of particles in the mth set be nm . Then the initial state can be represented by

where the symbols ui(m) stand for binary variables  {0, 1} with uc i(m) = 1 - ui(m) . Now imagine that the first pm particles from all the entangled sets are brought toN gether (i.e a total of p = m=1 pm particles) and a joint measurement is performed on all of them. Note that the set of all cat states of p particles forms a complete orthonormal basis. Let the nature of the measurement on the selected particles be such that it projects them to this basis. Such a basis will be composed of states of the type
N pm N pm

(6)

By simply operating with |(p) (p)| on | of Eq.(4), we find that the rest of the particles (i.e those not being measured) are projected to states of the type
N N nm N nm

It is clear that the most interesting aspect of this scheme is that particles 1 and 4 which do not share any common past are entangled after the swapping.

where |E(n) denotes a n particle cat state. As a specific example, in Fig.2, we have shown the conversion of a collection of two Bell states and a 3 particle GHZ state to a 3 particle GHZ state and a 4 particle GHZ state due to a projection of 3 of these particles to a 3 particle GHZ state.

A, B, C and D are users who share the Bell pairs (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8) respectively with a central exchange O. Now suppose that A, B and C wish to share a GHZ triplet. Then a measurement which projects particles 2, 3 and 5 to GHZ states will have to be performed at O. Immediately, particles 1, 4 and 6 belonging to A, B and C respectively will be reduced to a GHZ state. In a similar manner one can entangle particles belonging to any N users of the network and create a N particle cat state. The main advantages of using this technique for establishing entanglement over the simple generation of N particle entangled states at a source and their subsequent distribution are as follows. (A) Firstly, each user can at first purify [19] a large number of partially decohered Bell pairs shared with the central exchange to obtain a smaller number of pure shared Bell pairs. These can then be used as the starting point for the generation of any types of multiparticle cat states of the particles possessed by the users. The problems of decoherence during propagation of the particles can thus be avoided in principle. Also the necessity of having to purify N-particle cat states can be totally evaded. Purification of singlets followed by our scheme will generate N-particle cats in their purest form. (B) Secondly, our method allows a certain degree of freedom to entangle particles belonging to any set of users only if the necessity arises. It may not be known in advance exactly which set of users will need to share a N particle cat state. To arrange for all possibilities in an a priori fashion would require selecting all possible combinations of users and distributing particles in multiparticle entangled states among them. That is very uneconomical. On the other hand, generating entangled N-tuplets at the time of need and supplying them to the users who wish to communicate is definitely time consuming.

FIG. 2. The conversion of two Bell states and a 3 particle GHZ state to a 3 particle GHZ state and a 4 particle GHZ state due to a GHZ state projection on three particles (one taken from each of the initially entangled sets) is shown. The bold lines connect mutually entangled particles and the dashed lines connect particles on which the GHZ state projection is made.

As must be evident from Fig.2, there is a general pencil and paper rule for finding out the result when our method of entanglement manipulation is applied to a certain collection of cat states of particles. One just has to connect the particles being measured to frame a polygon and those not being measured to frame a complementary polygon. These two polygons represent the two multiparticle cat states obtained after the manipulation.
IV. ESTABLISHING MULTIPARTICLE ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN PARTICLES LOCATED AT DIFFERENT NODES OF A COMMUNICATION NETWORK

We now describe how our method of multiparticle entanglement manipulation can be used to set up entanglement between particles belonging to N users in a communication network. To begin with, each user of the network needs to share entangled pairs of particles (in a Bell state) with a central exchange. Consider Fig.3: 3

A 1

FIG. 3. The configuration used for the distribution of entanglement. Initially users A,B,C and D share Bell pairs with the central exchange O. Subsequently, a local measurement at O is sufficient to entangle particles belonging to any subset of users chosen from A, B, C and D .

It is pertinent to compare our scheme with the BHM cryptographic network with exchanges [14]. There are two main differences. (A) Firstly, they used a time reversed EPR scheme for setting up the connections and had quantum memories to protect their states. They had, of course, compared their scheme with one that uses the original entanglement swapping of two Bell pairs to establish connections. We, use a multiparticle generalization of entanglement swapping for our connections and are thereby unable to take advantage of any type of quantum memories. (B) Secondly, their prime focus was to connect any pair of users of a N-user network on request, while our main focus is to establish multiparticle entangled states of the particles possesed by the users.
V. PRACTICAL USES OF STANDARD ENTANGLEMENT SWAPPING A. Speeding up the distribution of entanglement

station O and the users A and B to communicate the particular Bell state to which particles 1 and 4 are projected. So for photons in Bell states, this procedure cannot really save any time. But for particles possesing mass, this is definitely a way to reduce the time needed to supply to distant users with a Bell pair. In this way one can reduce the time needed to supply two distant users with a Bell pair even further by including more and more Bell pair producing and measuring substations on the way.

O (b) 1 23 C O D 4

We now explain how standard entanglement swapping helps to save a significant amount of time when one wants to supply two distant users with a pair of atoms or electrons (or any particle possesing mass) in a Bell state from some central source. The trick is to place several Bell state producing and Bell state measuring substations in the route between them. Consider Fig.4(a): A and B are two users separated by a distance L; O, which is situated midway between A and B is a source of Bell pairs. The time needed for the particles to reach A and B is at least t1 = L/2v where v < c (the speed of light) is the speed of the particles. Now consider Fig.4(b) in which two Bell pair producing stations C and D are introduced halfway between AO and BO respectively and O is now just a Bell state measuring station. At t = 0, both C and D send off Bell pairs (1,2) and (3,4) respectively. 2 and 3 arrive at O, 1 reaches A and 4 reaches B. They all arrive at their destinations exactly at t = L/4v. At this instant a Bell state measurement is performed on particles 2 and 3 at O. This measurement immediately reduces the particles 1 and 4 reaching A and B respectively, to a Bell state. If the time of measurement is denoted by tm , then the time needed to supply a Bell pair to A and B with the two extra substations C and D on the path is t2 = L/4v + tm . It is evident that t2 is lesser than t1 if tm < L/4v. Of course, to this time one needs to add the time needed to do classical communication between the 4

FIG. 4. A method of increasing the speed of distributing an entangled pair of particles (that posses mass) between two distant users A and B is illustrated. Extra Bell state generating substations C and D are inserted between A and B and a Bell state projection is performed at O to speed up the distribution of a Bell pair between A and B.

B. Correction of amplitude errors developed due to propagation

We would like to show that entanglement swapping can be used, with some probability which we quantify, to correct amplitude errors that might develop in maximally entangled states during propagation. Assume that in Fig.4(b), the Bell pairs emitted from C and D acquire amplitude errors and become less entangled states of the type | = cos |01 + sin |10 . (9)

Thus, the combined state of the two entangled pairs, when particles 2 and 3 reach O is given by,

| = cos2 |0101 + sin  cos (|1001 + |0110 ) + sin2 |1010 .

(10)

(1) All members of the group must be able to decrypt the encrypted public messages broadcasted by any member of the group. (2) Nobody outside the group must be able to decrypt the encrypted public messages broadcasted by members of this group. Such requirements may arise when the members of a committee are to take some decision which has to have the consent of everybody within the committee, but must be kept secret from the rest of the world. One can regard this as a special case of networked cryptographic conferencing [13,14].To establish the secret key for this type of meeting, the committee can employ either of two possible options. The first one is to use simple two-user cryptographic key distributions [1,21], to set up random keys shared by each pair of users. Whenever a certain user intends to broadcast a secret message for the group, she has to encrypt it using a separate key for each of the other users of the group. However, for the type of conferencing considered here, this is not a good option because of two reasons. Firstly, the broadcaster has to encrypt the same message several times using different keys. Secondly, the broadcaster will have the freedom to send different messages to different members of the group and thereby mislead a subset of the group. A better option is that the users within the group share particles in multiparticle maximally entangled states. To generate the random key, all users conduct measurements in two nonorthogonal bases on the particles belonging to them. The results of those measurements in which the bases chosen by all the users coincide, are used to establish the secret key known to all the users within the group. This can then be used to frame encrypted messages that can be decrypted by an user if and only if she is a member of the group. If the users are sure about the fact that they are sharing a perfect N-particle cat state, they can even use a single basis to perform their measurements and thereby reduce the wastage of bits due to the noncoincidence of all their bases. It is known that the 3 particle GHZ states are eigenstates of certain operators of the form Sx Sx Sy [7] and by measuring the eigenvalues of these operators one can verify whether the state is intact or corrupted by some evesdropper. But measuring these operators should not change the particular GHZ state in which the particles are because this state is an eigenstate of the operator being measured. So, in principle, while doing a 3 party cryptography with a 3 particle GHZ state, one can essentially use the same set of particles for verifying the fidelity of the GHZ state and the susequent establishment of a secret key. It should be mentioned here that the idea of using GHZ states for cryptography is not entirely new but has been presented earlier [12].

If a Bell state measurement is now performed on particles 2 and 3 that reach O, then the probability of them being projected onto the Bell states |00 + |11 or |00 - |11 is sin2 2/2, while the probability of them being projected onto any of the other two Bell states is (1+cos2 2)/2. In the first case (i.e when 2 and 3 get projected to |00 +|11 or |00 - |11 ), the distant particles 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell states |00 + |11 or |00 - |11 . In this way in spite of amplitude errors due to propagation of the particles, A and B may finally share a Bell state. Of course in case of the other two outcomes of the state of particles 2 and 3, particles 1 and 4 go to states even less entangled than that of Eq.(9). That is why we can consider entanglement swapping suitable for correction of amplitude errors only probabilistically. The probability of success in this case (sin2 2/2), is lower than the probability of failure ((1 + cos2 2)/2). However, from the outcome of the Bell state measurement, one knows when the correction has been successful. This may be regarded as a kind of purification in series in contrast to the standard purifications [19] which occur in parallel. It should be noted that earlier there have been suggestions [20] of placing several stations in series in the path between two distant users, purifying singlets shared by adjacent stations and then using teleportation from one station to the next to derive purified singlets shared by the two users. The suggestion here is quite different in the sense that the methodology of entanglement swapping itself is being used for supplying a pair of distant users with a pure Bell pair and no separate purification procedure is invoked.

VI. COMMUNICATION SCHEMES USING DISTRIBUTED MULTIPARTICLE ENTANGLEMENT

So far we have described how particles belonging to several users in a network can be put in a multiparticle entangled state. We now describe how such a situation can be useful. The uses that readily come to mind are tests of nonlocality for many particle entangled states [7­9]. Reducing the communication complexity of certain functions [10] may also be a field of application of multiparticle entangled states. We describe here two possible applications in communications.

A. Cryptographic conferencing

Consider the following situation. A certain group of users may need to have a secret meeting. Let the meeting be subject to the following two conditions: 5

B. A multiparticle generalization of entanglement swapping

Sharing particles in a multiparticle entangled state may also help an user to read messages from more than one user through a single measurement. This is a kind of generalization of the well known superdense coding scheme [3]. Suppose N + 1 users are sharing a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state, possessing one particle each. Also suppose that one of them, say user 1, intends to receive messages from the N other users, whom we shall refer to as senders. This can be done in the following way. The N senders will have to mutually decide a priori to perform only certain unitary operations on the particles given to them. One of the senders will have any of 4 possible unitary operations at his/her disposal, while each of the others will have any of 2 possible unitary operations at their disposal. They will be encoding bits onto the particles possessed by them through these unitary operations. In that way, one of the senders will be encoding 2 bits on his/her particle, while each of the others will be encoding 1 bit each. Now, the unitary transformations must be so chosen that for each possible combination of unitary transformations performed by the senders, the state of the N + 1 particles go to a different member of the set of maximally entangled states of N + 1 particles. This is certainly possible because the N senders are allowed to perform 4 × 2 × 2 × ... × 2 = 2N +1 different combinations of unitary operations on the initial N + 1 particle maximally entangled state and there are exactly 2N +1 states in the set of maximally entangled states of N + 1 particles. After performing their unitary operations, each of the N senders send their particles to user 1. User 1 then performs a measurement on the N + 1 particles possessed by him, which identifies the particular maximally entangled state in which these particles are. Since each of these maximally entangled states correspond to a different combination of unitary transformations performed by the senders, he can learn about the messages sent by each of the senders from the outcome of his measurement. Thus a single measurement is sufficient to reveal the messages sent by more than one user.

FIG. 5. The general circuit to generate a N particle maximally entangled state from disentangled inputs is shown. One can generate any desired state chosen from the basis of maximally entangled states of N particles by inputting an appropriate combination of zeros and ones at the input port on the left hand side. When we input any specific N particle maximally entangled state from the right hand side, then by measuring the bits obtained on the left hand side, one can conclude which maximally entangled state was inputted. In other words, when run in the reverse direction, the circuit represents a measuring device for N particle maximally entangled states. The box in the figure stands for a Hadamard transformation .

Now let us compare the efficiency of the above scheme with the case when user 1 performs a superdense coded communication [3] with each of the N senders separately. For that we have to refer to the quantum circuits needed to perform measurements of multiparticle maximally entangled states. The circuit shown in Fig.5 does exactly this when run in the reverse direction (i.e inputs from the right and output from the left). The vertical lines are Controlled Nots [22] and the box is a unitary transformation equivalent to a rotation on the Bloch sphere known as the Hadamard transformation [22] (For optical implementations of elementary gates, see e.g. [23]). Thus, if user 1 was using our scheme then she would need to measure a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state and therefore require N Controlled Nots and one Hadamard transformation gate. She learns N + 1 bits of information from this measurement. Thus if a Hadamard transformation takes time th and a Controlled Not takes time tc , then the rate of information gain is r1 = N +1 th + N t c (11)

bits per unit time. On the other hand, if user 1 was separately doing superdense coded communication with each of the N senders, she would need to do N Bell state measurements which require one Controlled Not and one Hadamard transformation each. She gains 2N bits of information from this. Thus the rate of information gain in this case is r2 = 2N . N (th + tc ) (12)

If one assumes that quantum gates have the same time scale of operation (that is, th = tc ), then r2 is exactly equal to r1 . However if one defines efficiency as rate divided by the number of particles used (considering particles and channels required to propagate them to be important resources), then our method is definitely more efficient because it requires only N + 1 particles as opposed to superdense coded communication with each sender which requires 2N particles.

VII. ENTANGLED STATES OF HIGHER NUMBER OF PARTICLES FROM ENTANGLED STATES OF LOWER NUMBER OF PARTICLES

VIII. COMPARISON WITH THE METHOD OF ZEILINGER ET AL.

Entangled states involving higher number of particles can be generated from entangled states involving lower number of particles by employing our scheme. The basic ingredients which we need are GHZ (three particle maximally entangled) states and a Bell state measuring device. Let us describe how to proceed from a N particle maximally entangled state to a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state. One has to take one particle from the N particle maximally entangled state and another particle from a GHZ state and perform a Bell state measurement on these two particles. The result will be to put these two particles in a Bell state and the remaining N +1 particles in a maximally entangled state . Symbolically, the way of proceeding from a N particle maximally entangled state to a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state is given by |E(N )  |E(3) Bell State Meas. - |E(N + 1)  |E(2) .

We would now like to compare our method of generating multiparticle entangled states to that of Zeilinger et al [17]. We describe how the Zeilinger group's scheme works in the spirit of the former sections, i.e. using projections onto the Bell states. We then use simple quantum computational networks, consisting of Controlled Not and Not operations [22], to present measurements in the Bell and generalized Bell basis. This quantum computational approach, as we will see shortly, immediately reveals a basic similarity between the two schemes of generating multiparticle entangled states and shows precisely how they differ. Assume that we start with two entangled pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) of two-level systems in a state |(1, 2)  |(3, 4) = (|0, 0 + |1, 1 )  (|0, 0 + |1, 1 ) = |0, 0, 0, 0 + |0, 0, 1, 1 + |1, 1, 0, 0 + |1, 1, 1, 1 . (13) As before we omit the normalization. The fact that we use this particular, "computational" basis (0, 1) does not limit the generality of our method, but is more convenient in describing the action of quantum gates. Suppose now that we affect a Controlled Not gate between qubits 2 (control) and 3 (target), i.e. qubit 3 changes its value only if qubit 2 is in the state |1 . The above state then becomes: |0, 0, 0, 0 + |0, 0, 1, 1 + |1, 1, 1, 0 + |1, 1, 0, 1 (14)

An example of proceeding from a 4 particle maximally entangled state to a 5 particle maximally entangled state by the above procedure is shown in Fig.5 .

Now we measure the value of the third qubit. We have two possibilities depending on whether the outcome of this measurement is 0 or 1: |0, 0, 0 + |1, 1, 1 |0, 0, 1 + |1, 1, 0 outcome outcome 0 1 (15) (16)

FIG. 6. Building of a 5 particle entangled state from a 4 particle entangled state using a GHZ state and a Bell state measurement

As far as the question of generating the GHZ state, which is a basic ingredient, is concerned, one can perhaps use the method suggested by Zeilinger et al. [17] which is described in the next section. Alternatively, one can generate GHZ states using our method by starting from three Bell pairs and performing a GHZ state measurement taking one particle from each pair. An explicit scheme to produce 3-particle GHZ states from 3 entangled pairs have been suggested by Zukowski et al. [18] earlier. 7

So, by the action of a single Controlled not gate and a measurement , we can create a GHZ state out of two pairs initially in a Bell state. A network for this operation is given in Fig. 7. Now this directly generalizes to more entangled particles. Suppose that we have a group of N entangled particles and M entangled particles, each one in a maximally entangled state. It is then enough to perform a Controlled Not operation between a particle from the first and a particle from the second group, and then a measurement of the target particle. The end product will clearly be a maximally entangled state of N + M - 1 particles and a single particle disentangled from the rest. This completes our description of Zeilinger et al's scheme.

IX. CONCLUSION

FIG. 7. Implementation of Zeilinger's scheme using quantum gates. The production of a GHZ state with the use of a controlled not, and a measurement is shown.

Let us now compare this to our scheme of generating multiparticle entanglement. The basic ingredient in our protocol is a projection onto a maximally entangled state of N particles. The network for a measurement in this basis is an inverse of the network which generates maximally entangled state from a distentangled input in the computational basis. It is simply the circuit of Fig. 5 run in the reverse direction. In order to generate a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state , we have to do a Bell state measurement selecting one particle from the GHZ state and another particle from a N particle maximally entangled state. A Bell state measurement will require a Controlled Not gate and a Hadamard transformation gate, as is evident from Fig. 5 , specializing to the case of two inputs. Meanwhile, to generate a N + 1 particle maximally entangled state using Zeilinger group's scheme one may require to start with a N particle maximally entangled state and a Bell state and will have to perform a Controlled Not choosing one particle from each set followed by a measurement on one of the particles. Hence as far a comparing our scheme with Zeilinger group's scheme is concerned, in the case of generating N + 1 particle maximally entangled state from a N particle maximally entangled state, our scheme has just one extra Hadamard transformation. However, our method necessarily requires a GHZ state for proceeding from N to N + 1 particle maximally entangled state, while for the scheme of Zeilinger et al, Bell states are sufficient. In that sense the latter method is simpler. However as far as setting up entanglement between particles belonging to distant users is concerned, our method is necessary. For example, if the operator at O in Fig.3 performed the manipulation described by the Zeilinger group manipulation on particles 2 and 3, then 1, 2 and 4 will go into a GHZ state and essentially the subsystem of particles 1 and 4 will be in a disentangled state. This method will thus not be applicable to setting up entanglement between particles belonging to distant users.

In this paper we have described a scheme for manipulation of multiparticle entangled states and have demonstrated its potential applications. Our analysis remains at a very schematic and theoretical level, and practical implementations have not been considered. The direction from which practical implementations of our scheme and similar schemes may be approached is uncertain at present. There is, however, a number of possible practical implementations involving entangled photons [17,23], entangled ions in a linear trap [24] and entangled nuclear spins in NMR [25]. In general, any medium that proves to be useful for quantum computation will immediately support implementation of multiparticle entanglement manipulations. This may also enable us to study the problem of quantifying the amount of entanglement in a given multi-particle entangled state [26]. For example, we showed how to create an N particle entangled state given an M particle entangled state. By studying creation and destruction of entanglement in these measurements we can perhaps relate amounts of entanglement present in states involving different number of particles. In this paper we have dealt solely with pure states. It should be interesting to generalize our scheme to arbitrary density matrices. A novel feature of entanglement swapping is that it allows superluminal establishment of entanglement between two distant particles. This contrasts with standard schemes of setting up entanglement which rely on generating entangled particles at a point and supplying them to distant users and as such can take place at most at the speed light takes to travel from the source of the particles to either of the users. Another feature of entanglement swapping is that the particles which are entangled finally can come from totally independent initial sets of entangled particles, which means they must have had different values of local hidden variables (if one supposed that they exist). It should then be interesting to investigate whether these can lead to any stronger type or different type of violation of local hidden variable (LHV) models than that given by Bell's inequality.

Abstract In this paper we give a quantum mechanical algorithm that can search a database by a single query, when the number of solutions is more than a quarter. It utilizes modified Grover operator of arbitrary phase.

Introduction

For N  N, let ZN = {0, 1, . . . , N - 1} denote the additive cyclic group of order N and consider an arbitrary function F : ZN  Z2 , The database searching problem is to find some i  ZN such that F (i) = 1 under the assumption that such an i exists. We assume that the structure of F is unknown so that it is not possible to obtain a knowledge about F without evaluating it on ZN . Let t = |{i  ZN : F (i) = 1}|. There is a quantum mechanical algorithm to solve this problem in expected time of order O( N/t), which is optimal up to a multiplicative constant [4, 2, 1]. Especially when t = N/4 is known, the original Grover algorithm in [4] can search a solution only by a single query [2]. It uses the -phase, i.e., marking the states by multiplying ei = -1. When t = N/2, by changing this phase to /2, that is, by marking the states by multiplying ei/2 = i and modifying the corresponding diffusion transform according to this phase, the solution can be found with certainty after a single iteration [3]. In this paper, we generalize Grover algorithm for arbitrary phase. When t  N/4, we give generalized conditional phase and diffusion transform

Grover Operator of Arbitrary Phase

Let BN = {|a }aZn = {|e1 , |e2 , . . . , |eN } be the standard basis of an n2 qubit quantum register with N = 2n and HN be the corresponding Hilbert space, which represents the state vectors of a quantum system. Let Hm be an m-dimensional subspace of HN spanned by a basis Bm = {|ei1 , |ei2 , . . . , |eim }. Let l be a positive integer such that 1  l  m. For   R, the conditional -phase transform on a subspace Hm , SHm : F, Hm  Hm is defined by  for k = 1, 2, . . . , m, where i = -1. Let SHm denote SHlm , where Fl (eik ) = F , l, ik il .

For example, when m is a power of 2, in a suitably arranged basis we may H set W1 m to be the Walsh-Hadamard transform. When m is not a power of 2, the approximate Fourier transform in [5] can be used.

TWO-MODE SQUEEZED STATES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS: KEY TO HADRON MODIFICATION IN DENSE MATTER
M. ASAKAWA Department of Physics, School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya, 464 - 01, Japan ¨  T. CSORGO MTA KFKI RMKI, H - 1525 Budapest 114, POB. 49, Hungary Department of Physics, Columbia University, 538 W 120-th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA
We discuss the possibility to observe hadron modification in hot and dense matter via the correlation of identical particles. We find that a modification of hadronic masses in medium leads to two-mode squeezing which signals itself in large backto-back correlations of hadrons. This effect leads to a large signal of a small shift in -mass at RHIC.

Introduction

The Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) effect has been widely measured in heavy ion collisions. It has been expected that the effect will give some clue to the size of the system at freeze-out. Another interesting topic in heavy ion physics is the possibility of hadron modification in medium. So far these two have been considered as two different aspects of heavy ion physics. The HBT effect is concerned with freeze-out where interaction disappears, whereas the hadron modification is caused by interaction. However, this picture is purely classical. Since the HBT effect is of quantum nature, we need quantum mechanical consideration. In relativistic heavy ion collisions, freeze-out looks rather prompt. The distribution of final state hadrons is, in most of the cases, almost exponential 1 and this suggests that the system is almost thermalized up to some time and then breaks up suddenly 2 . Motivated by this, we have modeled 3,4 freezeout as follows. The system remains thermalized until freeze-out. Hadrons are modified due to interaction and their masses are shifted. As a result, it is dressed pseudo-particles that are thermalized. Then, freeze-out is assumed to take place suddenly. This scenario was investigated in details for small modification of pion and kaon masses in ref. 4 . Here we summarize the theoretical results of that work and will apply the results to the correlation signal of mass modification of  mesons. 1

Calculation of Correlation Functions

In this paper, we use the following scalar theory and we ignore the isospin structure, because it is not essential in our argument. Throughout this paper, we adopt the mean field approximation for simplicity and for clarity. In addition, we do not take into account the finiteness of the system. Calculations for finite systems will be presented elsewhere. The theory in the vacuum is given by the following free Lagrangian L0 : L0 = 1 1 µ (x) µ (x) - m2 2 (x), 2 2 0 (1)

where m0 is the vacuum mass of the scalar field (x). After standard canonical quantization and normal ordering, we get the well-known diagonalized Hamiltonian, H0 = k a ak d3 k, where k = m2 + k2 . When the temper0 k ature and/or chemical density is non-vanishing and the mass of the  field is shifted, within the mean field approximation, this is expressed by the following Lagrangian in medium LM : LM = 1 1 µ (x) µ (x) - (m2 + m2 )2 (x). 1 2 2 0 (2)

The mass shift M is given by M = m2 + m2 - m0 . Let us define the 1 0 quanta that diagonalize the Lagrangian (2) as bk . The point here is that the b-quanta are, in general, different from the a-quanta which are the fundamental excitations in the vacuum. In other words, the a-operators do not diagonalize the Hamiltonian in medium HM . By normal ordering of HM , we obtain HM H1 = = H0 + H 1 , 1 m2 1 [ak a-k + 2a a-k + a a ] d3 k. -k k -k 4 k

(3)

Therefore, in medium, mode k and mode -k of the a-quanta are mixed. This Hamiltonian (3) can be exactly diagonalized with the following Bogoliubov transformation: a = cosh rk b + sinh rk b-k , k k ak = sinh rk b + cosh rk bk , -k a = cosh r-k b + sinh r-k bk , -k -k a-k = sinh r-k b + cosh r-k b-k , k (4)

where rk = 0.5 log (k /k ) and k = m2 + m2 + k2 . This gives the exact 0 1 relationship between the quanta in the vacuum (a-quanta) and the quanta in medium (b-quanta) in this theory. With the b-operators, the in-medium 2

Hamiltonian (3) is diagonalized as HM = k b bk d3 k. This is almost trivial, k since the mass of the  field is shifted to m2 + m2 in medium. However, 0 1 the important point here is that it is the b-quanta that are thermalized in medium, since the b-operators diagonalize the in-medium Hamiltonian. On the other hand, the b-quanta are not observed experimentally. It is the aquanta that are observed. Therefore, in calculating final state observables, we have to evaluate the expectation value of operators defined in terms of a and a operators, O(a, a ) with the density matrix defined in the b-basis, b , i.e., O(a, a ) = Tr b O(a, a ). The calculation of the one and two-particle distribution functions which are needed to obtain the two-particle correlation is straightforward, but the Glauber ­ Sudarshan representation of the thermal density matrix 5 , d2 k b = P (k )|k k |, (5) 
k

is useful . Here |k is a coherent state satisfying bk |k = k |k and P (k ) = 1 fB,k exp - |k |2 fB,k , (6)

3

where fB,k is the Bose­Einstein distribution function with mass m2 + m2 . 0 1 With this formula, we obtain the one-particle distribution in the final state, a ak = cosh 2rk fB,k + sinh2 rk . k (7)

This result for the spectrum is the same for the two-mode squeezing as the one obtained for one-mode squeezed states. Since we have ignored the finite size effect, the two-particle distribution function a a  ak ak takes a trivial value k k a ak a  ak unless k = ±k . If we assume the uniformity of the system, k k i.e., fB,k = fB,-k and rk = r-k , we get the two-particle correlation functions C2 (k, ±k) as follows: C2 (k, k) = 2(!), fB,k (fB,k +1) sinh2 2rk + 2 sinh4 rk = 1. (cosh 2rk fB,k + sinh2 rk )2 (8) C2 (k, -k) = 1 +

In all other cases, the two-particle correlation function is 1. This result implies two important issues, (i) the intercept of the correlation function C2 (k, k) remains the canonical value of 2, even if quanta in medium are different from those in the vacuum, (ii) back-to-back correlation (C2 (k, -k) = 1) is generated by hadron modification. This is caused by the mixing of k and -k modes due to the mean field effect. 3

Fig. 1. Slight mass-shift of  results in large back-to-back correlations.

Thus the correlation properties of two-mode squeezed states are essentially different from those properties of the one-mode squeezed states, that were invoked in ref. 3 . In our case, the mean field carries no momentum. Due to momentum conservation, only k and -k modes get additional correlation. In contrast, when one mode squeezing is assumed, C2 (k, -k) = 1 and one can show that the intercept of the two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation function may take up any non-negative value: 0 < C2 (k, k) < . The medium effects on the momentum distribution of pions and kaons are evaluated numerically for static fireballs on Figs. 1 and 2. of ref. 4 . These figures indicates that the medium modification of hadronic masses results in a very small change in the shape of the momentum distributions. The deviation of C2 (k, -k) from unity was found to be small for pions in ref. 4 if their massshift is below the 10% level. However, the medium modification of kaons may be observable in the two-particle correlation function according to Figs. 4 and 5. of ref. 4 . The enhancement at large values of particle momenta in the CMS of the fireball is a strongly increasing function of the medium modification of the kaonic masses, e.g. a 14 MeV decrease of kaonic mass results in a 10 % increase of C(k, -k) correlation function. Since back-to-back correlations of  mesons may be observable by the PHENIX detector at RHIC 6 , (the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider which shall be operational by 1999 colliding Au + Au with  s = 40 TeV) we apply here our model to the case of a tiny mass-shift of 4

-mesons on Fig. 1. Since the  is much heavier than the kaons, the backto-back correlation function of  mesons has a much better signal/noise ratio, than that of kaons, which is due to the heavier mass of  (m = 1020 MeV vs. mK = 494 MeV). Fig. 1. indicates that a 1 % shift in the mass of  mesons results in a 50 % signal at |k| = 500 MeV. 3 Summary

A new method has been found to test the medium modification of kaons, utilizing their quantum correlations at large momentum difference. The effect follows from basic principles of statistical physics and canonical quantization. Back-to-back correlations are not contaminated by resonance decays, in contrast to the Bose­Einstein correlation functions at small relative momenta. For a locally thermalized expanding source, however, back-to-back correlations will appear in the rest frame of each fluid element. Thus, for such systems a more realistic estimate is necessary to learn more about the magnitude of the correlations of kaons at large relative momenta. This effect may be the only high transverse momentum signal of DCC formation and may provide a possibility for precision measurement of -mass modification at the RHIC accelerator. In the present study we have neglected finite size effects, which will make the correlation function vary smoothly around both k1 = k2 and k1 = -k2 . Acknowledgment We would like to thank M.

TWO-MODE SQUEEZED STATES IN HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS: KEY TO HADRON MODIFICATION IN DENSE MATTER ?
M. ASAKAWA Department of Physics, School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya, 464 - 01, Japan ¨  T. CSORGO MTA KFKI RMKI, H - 1525 Budapest 114, POB. 49, Hungary Department of Physics, Columbia University, 538 W 120-th Street, New York, NY 10027, USA
We discuss the possibility to observe hadron modification in hot and dense matter via the correlation of identical particles. We find that a modification of hadronic masses in medium leads to two-mode squeezing which signals itself in back-to-back correlations of hadrons. Although this effect leads to a signal of a shift in -mass at RHIC, larger signal is expected for the mass shift of kaons or pions.

Introduction

The Hanbury-Brown Twiss (HBT) effect has been widely measured in heavy ion collisions. It has been expected that the effect will give some clue to the size of the system at freeze-out. Another interesting topic in heavy ion physics is the possibility of hadron modification in medium. So far these two have been considered as two different aspects of heavy ion physics. The HBT effect is concerned with freeze-out where interaction disappears, whereas the hadron modification is caused by interaction. However, this picture is purely classical. Since the HBT effect is of quantum nature, we need quantum mechanical consideration. In relativistic heavy ion collisions, freeze-out looks rather prompt. The distribution of final state hadrons is, in most of the cases, almost exponential 1 and this suggests that the system is almost thermalized up to some time and then breaks up suddenly 2 . Motivated by this, we have modeled 3,4 freezeout as follows. The system remains thermalized until freeze-out. Hadrons are modified due to interaction and their masses are shifted. As a result, it is dressed pseudo-particles that are thermalized. Then, freeze-out is assumed to take place suddenly. This scenario was investigated for small modification of pion and kaon masses in ref. 4 . Here we summarize the correct theoretical results, following the ideas of ref. 4 , and will apply the results to the correlation signal of mass modification of  mesons. 1

Calculation of Correlation Functions

In this paper, we use the following scalar theory and we ignore the isospin structure, because it is not essential in our argument. Throughout this paper, we adopt the mean field approximation for simplicity and for clarity. In addition, we do not take into account the finiteness of the system. Calculations for finite systems will be presented elsewhere. The theory in the vacuum is given by the following free Lagrangian L0 : L0 = 1 1 µ (x) µ (x) - m2 2 (x), 2 2 0 (1)

where m0 is the vacuum mass of the scalar field (x). After standard canonical quantization and normal ordering, we get the well-known diagonalized Hamiltonian, H0 = k a ak d3 k, where k = m2 + k2 . When the temper0 k ature and/or chemical density is non-vanishing and the mass of the  field is shifted, within the mean field approximation, this is expressed by the following Lagrangian in medium LM : LM = 1 1 µ (x) µ (x) - m2 2 (x). 2 2  (2)

The mass shift M is given by M = m - m0 . Let us define the quanta that diagonalize the Lagrangian (2) as bk . The point here is that the b-quanta are, in general, different from the a-quanta which are the fundamental excitations in the vacuum. In other words, the a-operators do not diagonalize the Hamiltonian in medium HM . By normal ordering of HM , we obtain HM H1 = H 0 + H1 , m2 - m2  0 = 4 1 [a a + 2a a-k + a a ] d3 k. -k k -k k k -k

(3)

Therefore, in medium, mode k and mode -k of the a-quanta are mixed. This Hamiltonian (3) can be exactly diagonalized with the following Bogoliubov transformation: a = cosh rk b + sinh rk b-k , k k ak = sinh rk b + cosh rk bk , -k a = cosh r-k b + sinh r-k bk , -k -k a-k = sinh r-k b + cosh r-k b-k , k (4)

where rk = 0.5 log k /k and k = m2 + k2 . This gives the exact re lationship between the quanta in the vacuum (a-quanta) and the quanta in medium (b-quanta) in this theory. With the b-operators, the in-medium Hamiltonian (3) is diagonalized as HM = k b bk d3 k. This is almost trivial, since k 2

the mass of the  field is shifted to m in medium. However, the important point here is that it is the b-quanta that are thermalized in medium, since the b-operators diagonalize the in-medium Hamiltonian. On the other hand, the b-quanta are not observed experimentally. It is the a-quanta that are observed. Therefore, in calculating final state observables, we have to evaluate the expectation value of operators defined in terms of a and a operators, O(a, a ) with the density matrix defined in the b-basis, b , i.e., O(a, a ) = Tr b O(a, a ). The calculation of the one and two-particle distribution functions which are needed to obtain the two-particle correlation is straightforward, but the Glauber ­ Sudarshan representation of the thermal density matrix 5 , d2 k b = P (k )|k k |, (5) 
k

is useful . Here |k is a coherent state satisfying bk |k = k |k and P (k ) = | |2 1 exp - k nk nk , (6)

3

where nk is a Bose­Einstein distribution function with mass m : nk = exp( m2  1 . + k2 /T ) - 1 (7)

We obtain the following measurable one-particle distribution in the final state: N1 (k) = a ak = |ck |2 nk + |s-k |2 n-k + |s-k |2 , k (8)

where ck = cosh rk , sk = sinh rk (similar expressions hold for -k). If we assume the uniformity of the system, i.e., nk = n-k and rk = r-k , the spectrum of eq. (8) will become the same as the spectrum obtained for one-mode squeezed states 4 . Since we have ignored the finite size effect, the two-particle distribution function a a  ak ak takes a trivial value a ak a  ak unless k k k k k = ±k . We get the non-trivial two-particle correlation functions C2 (k, ±k) as follows: C2 (k, k) = 2(!), |c sk nk + c s-k n-k + c s-k |2 k -k -k = 1. N1 (k) N1 (-k) (9)

C2 (k, -k) = 1 +

In all other cases, the two-particle correlation function is 1. This result implies two important issues, (i) the intercept of the correlation function C2 (k, k) 3

remains the canonical value of 2, even if quanta in medium are different from those in the vacuum, (ii) back-to-back correlation (C2 (k, -k) = 1) is generated by hadron modification. This is caused by the mixing of k and -k modes due to the mean field effect.

Fig. 1. Large mass-shift of  results in a small back-to-back correlation. Solid line stands for a 10 %, dashed line for a 20 % decrease in m . The freeze-out temperature was assumed to be T = 140 MeV. Similar effect for pions leads to bigger signal.

Thus the correlation properties of two-mode squeezed states are essentially different from those properties of the one-mode squeezed states, that were invoked in ref. 3 . In our case, the mean field carries no momentum. Due to momentum conservation, only k and -k modes get additional correlation. In contrast, when one mode squeezing is assumed, C2 (k, -k) = 1 and one can show that the intercept of the two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation function may take up any non-negative value: 0 < C2 (k, k) < . Although the importance of the back-to-back correlation functions was well realized in ref 4 , the formula for the back-to-back correlation function was incorrectly given by eq. (18) of ref. 4 . The correct expression for the back-to-back correlation function is presented by our eq. (9). Since back-to-back correlations of  mesons may be observable by the PHENIX detector at RHIC 6 , (the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider which shall  be operational by 1999 colliding Au + Au at s = 40 TeV) we apply here 4

our model to the case of a 10 - 20 % mass-shift of -mesons on Fig. 1. The back-to-back correlation function of  mesons has a worse signal-to-noise ratio, than that of kaons, which is due to the heavier mass of  (m = 1020 MeV vs. mK = 494 MeV). Fig. 1. indicates that a 10 - 20 % shift in the mass of  mesons results in a small signal in the back-to-back correlation function. 3 Summary

A new method has been found to test the medium modification of bosons, utilizing their quantum correlations at large momentum difference. The effect follows from basic principles of statistical physics and canonical quantization. Back-to-back correlations are not contaminated by resonance decays at larger momentuma of the particles, in contrast to the Bose­Einstein correlation functions at small relative momenta. For a locally thermalized expanding source, however, back-to-back correlations will appear in the rest frame of each fluid element. Thus, for such systems a more realistic estimate is necessary to learn more about the magnitude of the correlations of  or other mesons at large relative momenta. Contrary to previous expectations 3,4 the effect is the biggest for the lightest particles (photons, pions or kaons) and the back-to-back correlations vanish for very large values of particle momenta.

INTRODUCTION

Tunneling times, reflection times and dwell times have been well studied for barriers. Regrettably, we still do not have universally accepted answers for these times; even the concepts for these times remain in dispute [1­4]. Part of the problem is that motion in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier is a quantum process that is confounded by the interference between matter reflecting and tunneling. Herein, we investigate reflection of particles with sub-barrier energy by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. This simplifies the problem as all particles are reflected only. We use a trajectory representation [5­8] to derive the reflection time. The generator of the motion for the trajectory is a generalized Hamilton's characteristic function [7,8]. We compare our results with those extrapolated from investigations of tunneling. We have chosen to examine the semi-infinite rectangular barrier because its Schr¨dinger representation o is familiar. Separation of variables applies. Furthermore, exact solutions exist in closed form in terms of elementary functions for both the trajectory and Schr¨dinger representations. o Microstates of the Schr¨dinger wave function exist for reflection by a semi-infinite barrier because this o barrier induces a nodal singularity in the trajectory representation that is associated with a non-isolated 1

zero in the Schr¨dinger wave function [8]. We show that the reflection time is deterministic. It depends o upon the particular microstate of the reflecting particle. A reflection time that is a function of the particular microstate is a manifestation that the Schr¨dinger wave function is not in general an exhaustive description o of nonrelativistic phenomenon. A recent investigation has shown that an Ermakov system, composed of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation and the Schr¨dinger equation, determines a constant of the motion in the form of an Ermakov o invariant [9]. That investigation has also shown that the microstates are functions of this Ermakov invariant. The existence of a deterministic reflection time that depends upon a constant of the motion that, in turn, specifies the microstate resolves the heretofore "underdetermination" between the Copenhagen interpretation and a causal interpretation [10] in favor of a causal interpretation. We include in this investigation a study of oblique incidence where we show the existence of Goos-H¨nchen a displacement between the incident trajectory's entry point and the reflected trajectory's exit point in the barrier [11]. The Goos-H¨nchen displacement is also deterministic. It too is dependent upon the particular a microstate. The Goos-H¨nchen effect is presented as a candidate to sidestep the conceptual difficulties in a tunneling with "clocks" [12] and the absence of a time operator in the operator formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics [13]. Our investigation of oblique incidence also shows that the trajectory representation is not a hydrodynamic representation for the trajectories are not stream lines as demonstrated by their becoming imbedded in the surface of constant Hamilton's characteristic function at the turning point infinitely deep inside the barrier. This allows velocities to increase without bound to develop along the trajectory at the turning point. This also induces the turning points to be cusps. The reflection time is finite for either normal or oblique incidence while the distance traversed by the trajectory is infinite. Therefore, the velocity along the trajectory must be infinite over a measurable duration. We also examine the square well which is an extension of the semi-infinite barrier problem. We report that the reflection time as well as the period of libration are determined by the particular microstate. We show that these times can be functions of a constant of the motion generated by an Ermakov system. The trajectory representation need not assign a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function o as shown elsewhere by certain transmission without reflection from a semi-infinite barrier by a particle with super-barrier energy [14] and by certain tunneling through a finite barrier by a particle with sub-barrier energy [15]. Without a probability requirement, the trajectory representation does not need a wave packet to describe or localize a particle. This simplifies our investigation by allowing us to use a monochromatic particle. This also generalizes our findings by making them independent of the shape of a wave packet. In this investigation, we apply the Schr¨dinger representation without the Copenhagen interpretation o which assigns a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function. Lest we forget, Schr¨dinger opposed o o the Copenhagen interpretation of his wave function. For completeness, scattering of particles with super-barrier energy from a semi-infinite barrier has been reported elsewhere [14]. In Section 2, we develop the equations of motion for normal incidence, determine the reflection time, and show that it is dependent upon the particular microstate. We develop the corresponding Schr¨dinger o representation to show that it does not discern the dependence due to microstates. In Section 3, we develop the trajectory equations for oblique incidence and determine the Goos-H¨nchen effect. We also demonstrate a that the trajectories are generally not wave normals. In Section 3, we develop the reflection time and the libration period for the square well. We show that reflection time and libration period are described by a constant of the motion that is beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.

NORMAL INCIDENCE

Equation of Motion: Let us initially consider the reflection of a particle that is normally incident to a semi-infinite rectangular barrier whose potential is given by

2

V (x) =

0, U,

x<0 x0

where U is finite positive. For normal incidence, the particle will have motion only in the x-direction. We choose a sub-barrier energy given by Ex = (¯ kx )2 /(2m) < U where Ex is the energy for an incident particle, h kx is the wavenumber in the x-direction, m is mass of the particle, and h = h/(2) where in turn h is Planck's ¯ constant. For normal incidence, we make it explicit by using Ex that only the x-dimension contributes to energy. The trajectory representation is based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. The timeindependent generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics is given for one-dimensional motion in the x-direction with normal incidence by [6­8] h ¯2 (W/x)2 + V - Ex = - < W;x > (1) 2m 4m where < W ; x > is the Schwarzian derivative of W with respect to x. The Schwarzian derivative is given by < W ; x >= 3  3 W/x3 - W/x 2  2 /W x2 W/x
2

.

In Eq. (1), W is Hamilton's characteristic function, W/x is the momentum conjugate to x. The left side of Eq. (1) manifests the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation while the Schwarzian derivative on the right side manifests the higher order quantum effects. We explicitly note that W and W/x are real even in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier (x  0). The general solution for W/x is given by [7,8] W/x = ±(2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1 (2)

where (a, b, c) is a set of real coefficients such that a, b > 0, and (, ) is a set of normalized independent solutions of the associated time-independent one-dimensional Schr¨dinger equation, o -¯ 2 d2  h + (V - Ex ) = 0. 2m dx2 The independent solutions (, ) are normalized so that their Wronskian, W(, ) =  d/dx - d/dx , is scaled to give W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)] > 0. ( The nonlinearity of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi h equation induces this normalization upon W.) This ensures that (a2 + b2 + c) > 0. We note for completeness that a particular set (, ) of independent solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation may be chosen o by the superposition principle so that the coefficient c is zero. The motion in phase space is specified by Eq. (2). This phase-space trajectory is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The ± sign in Eq. (2) designates that the motion may be in either x-direction. The corresponding solution for the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, W , is given by W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 +K (3)

where K is an integration constant which we may set to zero herein. Hamilton's characteristic function is a generator of motion. The equation of motion in the domain [x, t] is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for a constant coordinate (often called Jacobi's theorem). The procedure simplifies for coordinates whose conjugate momenta are separation constants. For stationarity, Ex is a separation constant for time for a trajectory with normal incidence. Thus, the equation of motion for the trajectory time, t, relative to its constant coordinate  , is given as a function of x by

3

t -  = W/Ex

(4)

where the trajectory for a given energy, Ex , is a function of a set of coefficients (a, b, c) and  specifies the epoch. Microstates: A particle with normal incidence and with sub-barrier energy, Ex , has its turning point at x =  where the Schr¨dinger wave function goes to a non-isolated zero [7,8]. In the generalized Hamiltono Jacobi representation, the barrier induces a nodal singularity at x =  in W/x [8]. From Eq. (2), W/x  0 as x  , regardless of the values of the coefficients a, b and c, because at least one independent solution of the set (, ), in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier, must increase without bound as x  . Each trajectory, which is specified by the particular values of the coefficients a, b and c, is a particular microstate of the Schr¨dinger wave function [7,8]. o Reflection: A set of independent solutions (, ) for our given semi-infinite rectangular barrier can be chosen as  x<0 1/4  cos[kx x + arctan(/kx )],  2m · (5) = exp(-x)  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4) x  0.  2 1/2 , [1 + (/kx ) ] and   sin[kx x + arctan(/kx )],  1/4   2m   kx kx ·  kx +  exp(x) + kx -  h ¯ 2 k 2 (ab - c2 /4)    2[1 + (/kx )2 ]1/2 x<0 exp(-x) , x0 (6)

=

where  = [2m(U - Ex )]1/2 . The corresponding Wronskian obeys W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 as h expected. The conjugate momentum is given by Eq. (2) as W (Ex , a, b, c, x)/x = ±(2m)1/2 [a2 (Ex , x) + b2 (Ex , x) + c(Ex , x)(Ex , x)]-1 where  and  are respectfully given by Eqs. (5) and (6) and where the dependence of the conjugate momentum upon energy, Ex , and the set of coefficients (a, b, c) is made explicit. By Eqs. (2), (5) and (6), W/x and  2 W/x2 are continuous across the barrier interface at x = 0. As expected, we see from Eq. (6) that the exp(x) term in  will induce a nodal singularity in W/x, Eq. (2), for any allowed values of the coefficients a, b and c at the trajectory's turning point at x = . We define the reflection time, tR , herein as the duration that a particle spends in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier, which is given by the round trip time for the particle between the barrier surface at x = 0 and the turning point at x = . From the equation of motion, Eq. (4), and Eqs. (3), (5) and (6), the reflection time, tR = 2[t() - t(0)], is given by tR = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] m . a + c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 ¯ kx h (7)

The reflection time, tR , is dependent upon the particular trajectory or microstate as specified by the coefficients a, b and c. We find that tR is inversely proportional to  consistent with Barton [16] who found that tunneling time, tT , decreased with increasing  for wave packets tunneling through inverted oscillator barriers. The reflection time is finite because  and kx are real and W 2 > 0. But the trajectory traverses an infinite distance between the interface at x = 0 and the turning point at x =  in a finite duration of time. 4

Hence, the velocity along the trajectory must be infinite for a measurable duration of time. Note that this infinite velocity exists even though limx W/x  0 as already noted. (We discuss later an analogous effect in higher dimensions, cf. § 3, ¶ Trajectory Directions and Wave Normals). As already noted, all trajectories, regardless of the particular values of the coefficients, a, b and c have their turning point at x =  because the solution, W/x, to the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (1), has a nodal point there. Any distribution of the reflection time, tR , over an ensemble of different microstates is due to the particular distribution of the coefficients a, b and c and not due to any adduced distribution of early turning points at finite depths as hypothesized by quantum interpretations that attribute a probability amplitude to . Let us now examine tR for a particular case. Let us assume that a = b and c = 0. In such case, the reflection time, Eq. (7), becomes tR = 2m/(¯ kx ) = h/[Ex (U - Ex )]1/2 . h ¯ This finding for monochromatic propagation is consistent with findings for tunneling by wave packets. For rectangular barriers, Hauge and Stovneng [1] and Olkhovsky and Recami [3] have shown for phase times and for Larmor times respectfully that tR = tT . For arbitrarily large thick barriers, Hartman [17] has shown that tT  2m/(¯ kx ) for spatial Gaussian wave packets, and Fletcher [18] has shown that tT = h/[Ex (U - Ex )]1/2 h ¯ for wave packets with temporal exponential leading and trailing tails. Schr¨dinger Representation: We now investigate the corresponding Schr¨dinger representation for moo o nochromatic reflection by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. The Schr¨dinger wave function, , can be o represented in trigonometric form as [7,8] (2m)1/4 cos(W/¯ ) h 2 /(4b)]1/2 (W/x)1/2 [a - c (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 cos arctan [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 = .

While  =  where  is independent of the coefficients a, b and c, the generator of motion, W , for each particular trajectory (a microstate of ) is a function of the coefficients a, b and c is given by Eq. (3). Hence, the Schr¨dinger wave function, , is not an exhaustive description of reflection of a particle with sub-barrier o energy by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. We can represent  in an exponential format as an alternative to Eq. (8) by = (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 2[a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 exp i arctan b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 + exp -i arctan b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2

where the first and second exponential terms represent respectfully the incident and reflected waves. Although  in its trigonometric representation, Eq. (8), is independent of the coefficients a, b and c, this is not the case for exponential case when the incident and reflected waves are considered individually. Neither the incident wave nor the reflected wave, when considered separately, are independent of these coefficients for [8,14] b(/) + c/2 (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 exp ±i arctan 2 /(4b)]1/2 2[a - c (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 ± ic/(4ab - c2 )1/2 ] ib .

When a = b and c = 0 as in the case studied by Olkhovsky and Racimi [3] and Hauge and Stovneng [1], then in the classically allowed region, x < 0, the generator of motion simplifies to 5

W (Ex , a, b, c, x)|a=b,c=0,x<0 = h arctan{tan[kx x + arctan(/kx )]}. ¯ This generator of the motion by Eq. (8) is, within a constant phase factor, consistent with an incident plane wave given by (2m)1/4 (kx - i) exp(ikx x), 2 2[¯ kx (kx + 2 )]1/2 h and a reflected plane wave given by (2m)1/4 (kx + i) exp(-ikx x). 2 2[¯ kx (kx + 2 )]1/2 h This is the particular microstate, where a = b, and c = 0, that contemporary physics tacitly assumes when working in the Schr¨dinger representation [17,18]. This particular microstate manifests rectilinear o propagation for both the incident and reflected unmodulated plane waves. The incident and reflected waves for a more general microstate, where a = b or c = 0, have compound modulation in both amplitude and wavenumber by Eq. (9) [14,15]. These waves with compound modulation are still solutions to the Schr¨dinger o equation [14].

OBLIQUE INCIDENCE

Trajectory Equation: Let us now examine the more general case of oblique incidence. We can always choose our cartesian coordinate system so that the trajectory lies in the x, y-plane. The generalized HamiltonJacobi equation and the Schr¨dinger equation are separable in cartesian coordinates. In a Hamilton-Jacobi o representation, the cartesian coordinate y is cyclic with a transformed constant y-momentum given by hky . ¯ The cartesian coordinate z is also cyclic but the transformed constant z-momentum is zero for our choice of orientation for the coordinate system. The generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for oblique incidence is given by (W/x)2 + (W/y)2 h ¯2 +V -E =- < W;x > 2m 4m where E is the energy for a particle with oblique incidence. As y-momentum is constant, any contribution due to a latent < W ; y > is zero. The solution for the generator of the motion is given by b(/) + c/2 + hky y. ¯ (ab - c2 /4)1/2 In the above,  and  are still given by Eqs.

where E is constrained so that kx and  are real. Equation (2) is still valid for W/x. The trajectory equation, which describes the progress of the trajectory along the cyclic coordinate y as a function of x, is the equation of motion produced by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for the constant (reference) coordinate yo given by y - yo = -W/(¯ ky ). h 6 (11)

Goos-H¨nchen Effect: The lateral displacement, y, between where the trajectory enters and exits the a barrier is known as the Goos-H¨nchen effect [11]. By the trajectory equation, Eq. (11), the Goos-H¨nchen a a effect, y = 2[y() - y(0)], is given by y = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] ky . a + c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 kx

Hence, the Goos-H¨nchen effect, for a given energy E and a given ky , is a function of the coefficients a, b a and c. Analogous to the time of reflection, y is inversely proportional to  and kx . The Goos-H¨nchen a effect gives us an alternative to reflection time for describing the quantum effects of reflection. Trajectory Directions and Wave Normals: We already know that the turning point for the trajectory is at x =  inside the semi-infinite barrier. We now investigate the behavior of the trajectory near the turning point by studying Eq. (11) there. As the trajectory approaches the turning point, we have that W/x goes to zero as lim W ky x exp(-2x) . - 4(ab - c2 /4)1/2 (¯ ky ) h kx 1 + (/kx )2 (12)

x

Thus, as x  , the trajectory becomes asymptotic to the x-direction regardless of the values of the coefficients a, b and c. Nevertheless, how W/x goes to zero is still a function of the coefficients a, b and c. Hence, the turning point at x =  for the trajectory is a symmetric cusp in the x, y-plane for all allowed values of a, b and c. This is just another manifestation that W/x has a nodal singularity for a particle with sub-barrier energy reflecting from a semi-infinite barrier. A symmetric cusp for a turning point at infinity formed by its two branches, with mirror symmetry of each other, approaching a common asymptote is consistent with traversing an infinite displacement in x while transversing only a finite distance y. It is also consistent with a Schr¨dinger wave function that decreases exponentially in the classically forbidden o region. Meanwhile, the wave normal is given by W . From Eq. (10), the wave normal is W = (2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1^ + hky ^. i ¯  (13)

At the turning point, we know that limx (a2 + b2 + c)-1 = 0 because at least one solution of the set of independent solutions (, ) must increase without bound at the turning point at x = . Thus, we conclude from Eqs. (12) and (13) that the trajectory's direction at the turning point is embedded in a surface of constant W because the wave normal is orthogonal to the trajectory. This is a manifestation that the trajectories are not stream lines of a hydrodynamic representation of quantum mechanics. We also conclude that, when the trajectory direction is embedded in a surface of constant W, its velocity increases without bound (cf. § 2, ¶ Reflection).

SQUARE WELLS

Let us now investigate reflection inside square wells as an extension of reflection from semi-infinite rectangular barriers. The potential for a square well may be given by V (x) = U, 0, |x| > q |x|  q

where q is finite positive and where Ex , U, kx and  maintain their previous definitions. A finite square well always has at least one symmetric bound state. While our results, Eqs. (16) and (17), are valid for both symmetric and antisymmetric bound states, we discuss only the symmetric bound states to shorten the presentation. We could have arbitrarily chosen to present only the antisymmetric (or odd) bound states 7

just as easily except that not all square wells have sufficient size, that is (2mU )1/2 q/¯ > /2, to ensure that h an antisymmetric bound state exists. For bound states, Ex < U . Energy is quantized for symmetric bound states by the familiar transcendental equation tan(kx q) = /kx , which can be established from either the quantization of the action variable, J, for symmetric states by [9] J= W/x dx = (2n + 1)h, n = 0, 1, 2, · · · and n < (2mU )1/2 q/¯ h

or the quantization energy, Ex , so that |x=± = 0. In either case, the quantization is independent of the coefficients a, b and c [7]. The set of independent solutions (, ) for this square well is chosen such that  represents the symmetric bound state given by  x>q  cos(kx q) exp[-(x - q)], 1/4   2m cos(kx x), -q  x  q · = (14)  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4)   cos(kx q) exp[(x + q)] x < -q. The other solution, , is unbound and is not unique as any amount of  may be added to it. While  is symmetric for the symmetric bound state, the corresponding  that we have chosen is antisymmetric. We present this unbound solution as   exp[(x - q)] - cos(2kx q) exp[-(x + a)]  , x>q    2 sin(kx q) 1/4  2m sin(kx x), -q  x  q (15) · =  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4)   cos(2kx q) exp[(x + q)] - exp[-(x + q)]   , x < -q.  2 sin(kx q) The corresponding Wronskian obeys W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 as expected. For bound states, h microstates of the Schr¨dinger wave function exist where the particular choice of the set of coefficients o (a, b, c) specifies a unique trajectory in phase space for a given quantized energy Ex [8]. By Eqs. (3), (4), (14) and (15) and by the quantizing condition tan(kx q) = /kx , we can evaluate the reflection time, t±R , as the time for the round trip between the barrier interface at x = ±q and the turning point at x = ±. The reflection time, t±R = 2|t(±q) - t(±)|, is finite for traversing an infinite distance as given by t±R = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] m a ± c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 ¯ kx h

(16)

where the sign for the coefficient c in the denominator is dependent upon which interface, x = ±q, is applicable. The trajectory for the microstate will not be symmetric for c = 0 for our choice of (, ). The existence of nonsymmetric microstates of symmetric Schr¨dinger wave functions has already been discussed o elsewhere [5]. Otherwise, Eqs. (7) and (16) are very similar. For completeness, we present the trajectory's period for a complete libration cycle for a bound microstate in our square well. This libration period, tLibration = 2|t() - t(-)|, for a microstate is given from Eqs. (3), (4), (14) and (15) and the quantizing condition tan(kx q) = /kx by tLibration = 4 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ][a + b(/kx )2 ] m(q + -1 ) . a2 + (2ab - c2 )(/kx )2 + b2 (/kx )4 h ¯ kx (17)

So the libration period is a function of the coefficients a, b and c even though, as shown elsewhere [7], the action variable and energy are not. For any allowed set of coefficients (a, b, c), tLibration is always finite. We may, for a given E or J, describe the microstate and subsequently express t±R and tLibration in terms of other constants instead of the full set of coefficients (a, b, c). The Wronskian, W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)], h provides one constant. Also, there exists a constant of the motion, I, which is an Ermakov invariant 8

established by the Ermakov system formed by the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (1), and the Schr¨dinger equation. This constant of the motion is given for bound states by [9] o I = {W   2 + (¯ 2 /W  )[W  /(2W  ) +   ]2 }/(2m)1/2 h = [a - c2 /(4b)]-1 = b¯ 2 W 2 /(2m) > 0. h (18)

Hence, I is positive definite for bound states (it is zero for unbound states [9]). The Ermakov invariant, I, and the normalized Wronskian, W, are functions of the set (a, b, c) but not E. Therefore, the set (I, W, a, b, c) is redundant [9]. Three independent members are necessary and sufficient to span the space described by this set. However, the subset (I, W, b) is also redundant with only two independent members as shown by Eq. (18). We are free to select I and any two other members of the set (I, W, a, b, c) except the combination (W, b) to describe t±R and tLibration for either a quantized E or J. Thus, t±R and tLibration are described by a constant of the motion that is beyond the Copenhagen interpretation. References 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. E. H.

Abstract The reflection time, during which a particle is in the classically forbidden region, is described by the trajectory representation for reflection by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. The Schr¨dinger wave o function has microstates for such reflection. The reflection time is a function of the microstate. For oblique reflection, the Goos-H¨nchen displacement is also a function of the microstate. For a square well a duct, we develop a proposed test where consistent overdetermination of the trajectory by a redundant set of observed constants of the motion would be beyond the Copenhagen interpretation.

INTRODUCTION

Tunneling times, reflection times and dwell times have been well studied for barriers. Regrettably, we still do not have universally accepted answers for these times; even the concepts for these times remain in dispute [1­4]. Part of the problem is that motion in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier is a quantum process that is confounded by the interference between matter reflecting and tunneling. Herein, we investigate reflection of particles with sub-barrier energy by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. This simplifies the problem as all particles are reflected only. We use a trajectory representation [5­8] to derive the reflection time. We compare our results with those extrapolated from other investigations of tunneling. We first study reflection time for normal incidence to show that the trajectory method is valid as it produces reflection times that are consistent with other results. We next study the Goos-H¨nchen displacement a for oblique incidence. We then consider square wells and ducts. The Goos-H¨nchen displacements for a a square well duct and other constants of the motion present a proposed, strong test for resolving the 1

"underdetermination" issue [9] whether the trajectory representation and the Copenhagen interpretations may be distinguished. This proposed test hinges on whether an overdetermined set of constants of the motion is consistent in observation with the theoretical redundance of this set. This investigation is an application of the trajectory representation. We begin with the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the trajectory and its solution, a generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, which is the generator of the motion [7,8]. Application of the trajectory representation to a quantum problem follows a recipe for processing the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function of quantum mechanics which in practice is similar to the recipe for processing the classical Hamilton's characteristic function for the analogous problem in classical mechanics. This recipe is standard; in both cases, the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equations for constant coordinates (often called Jacobi's theorem) are the equations of motion. Those unfamiliar with the trajectory representation who are interested in the theoretical foundations of the trajectory representation can find a progressive treatment in references 5 through 8. The trajectory representations differs with Bohmian mechanics [10] even though both spring from essentially the same generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation. These differences have been discussed elsewhere [5,6,11]. In this exposition, we shall note significant differences as they occur. We have chosen to examine the semi-infinite rectangular barrier because its Schr¨dinger representation o is familiar. Separation of variables applies. Furthermore, exact solutions exist in closed form in terms of elementary functions for both the trajectory and Schr¨dinger representations. o Microstates of the Schr¨dinger wave function exist for reflection by a semi-infinite barrier because this o barrier induces a nodal singularity in the trajectory representation that is associated with a non-isolated zero in the Schr¨dinger wave function [8]. We show that the reflection time and the Goos-H¨nchen displacement o a are deterministic. They depend upon the particular microstate of the reflecting particle. A reflection time or a Goos-H¨nchen displacement that is a function of the particular microstate is a manifestation that the a Schr¨dinger wave function is not in general an exhaustive description of nonrelativistic phenomenon. o We include in this investigation a study of oblique incidence where there is a Goos-H¨nchen displacement a between the incident trajectory's entry point and the reflected trajectory's exit point in the barrier [12]. We show that the Goos-H¨nchen displacement is dependent upon the particular microstate. The Goos-H¨nchen a a displacement is presented as a candidate to sidestep the conceptual difficulties in tunneling with "clocks" [13] and the absence of a time operator in the operator formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics [14]. Therefore, the Goos-H¨nchen displacement offers a better test for resolving the underdetermination a than reflection time. Our investigation of oblique incidence also shows that the trajectory representation is not a hydrodynamic representation, such as Bohmian mechanics, for the trajectories are not stream lines as they become imbedded in the surface of constant Hamilton's characteristic function at the turning point infinitely deep inside the barrier. This allows velocities to increase without bound along the trajectory at the turning point. This also induces the turning points to be cusps. The reflection time is finite for either normal or oblique incidence while the distance traversed by the trajectory is infinite. Therefore, the velocity along the trajectory must be infinite over a measurable duration. We also examine a square well and a square well duct which are extensions of the semi-infinite barrier problem. We report that the reflection time as well as the period of libration are determined by the particular microstate. We show that these times are functions of various constant of the motion. The trajectory representation is causal and not based upon chance [5­8]. The trajectory representation has shown, by certain tunneling through a finite barrier by a particle with sub-barrier energy, that the Born postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation, which attributes a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger o wave function, is unnecessary [15]. Any solitary trajectory or microstate is sufficient by itself to specify the Schr¨dinger wave function [7]. The set of initial conditions that are necessary and sufficient to specify the o particular trajectory or microstate are known [6]. There is no need to invoke an ensemble of trajectories to get the Schr¨dinger wave function or to describe quantum phenomena. The trajectory representation renders o predictions for an individual particle viz-a-viz the probability predictions of the Copenhagen representation for an ensemble of particles [15]. While both the trajectory representation and Bohmian mechanics are causal, Bohmian mechanics is still a stochastic theory [16] where an ensemble of trajectories are needed to 2

describe quantum phenomena. Without a stochastic requirement, the trajectory representation does not need a wave packet to describe or localize a particle. This simplifies our investigation by allowing us to use a monochromatic particle. This also generalizes our findings by making them independent of the shape of a wave packet. In this investigation, we apply the Schr¨dinger representation without the Copenhagen interpretation o which assigns a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function. Lest we forget, Schr¨dinger opposed o o the Copenhagen interpretation of his wave function. For completeness, scattering of particles with super-barrier energy from a semi-infinite barrier has been reported elsewhere [11]. In Section 2, we develop the equations of motion for normal incidence, determine the reflection time, and show that it is dependent upon the particular microstate. We develop the corresponding Schr¨dinger o representation as far as it goes to show that it does not discern the dependence due to microstates. In Section 3, we develop the trajectory equations for oblique incidence and determine the Goos-H¨nchen displacement. a We also demonstrate that the trajectories are generally not wave normals. In Section 4, we develop the reflection time and the libration period for the square well. We show that reflection time and libration period are described by constants of the motion that are beyond the Copenhagen interpretation. In Section 5, we investigate square well ducts. We develop the Goos-H¨nchen displacement and libration displacement a as constants of the motion for a trajectory in the square well duct. We show that overdetermining the microstate (trajectory) in a duct renders a strong test for resolving underdetermination.

NORMAL INCIDENCE

Equation of Motion: Let us initially consider the reflection of a particle that is normally incident to a semi-infinite rectangular barrier whose potential is given by V (x) = 0, U, x<0 x0

where U is finite positive. For normal incidence, the particle will have motion only in the x-direction. We choose a sub-barrier energy given by Ex = (¯ kx )2 /(2m) < U where Ex is the energy for an incident particle, h kx is the wavenumber in the x-direction, m is mass of the particle, and h = h/(2) where in turn h is Planck's ¯ constant. For normal incidence, we make it explicit by using Ex that only the x-dimension contributes to energy. The trajectory representation is based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. The timeindependent generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics is a phenomenological equation that is given for one-dimensional motion in the x-direction with normal incidence by [6­8] (W/x)2 h ¯2 + V - Ex = - W;x (1) 2m 4m where W ; x is the Schwarzian derivative of W with respect to x. The Schwarzian derivative is given by W;x = 3  3 W/x3 - W/x 2  2 W/x2 W/x
2

.

In Eq. (1), W is Hamilton's characteristic function, W/x is the momentum conjugate to x. The left side of Eq. (1) manifests the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation while the Schwarzian derivative on the right side manifests the higher order quantum effects. We explicitly note that W and W/x are real even in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier (x  0). The general solution for W/x is given by [7,8] W/x = ±(2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1 3 (2)

where (a, b, c) is a set of real coefficients such that a, b > 0, and (, ) is a set of normalized independent solutions of the associated time-independent one-dimensional Schr¨dinger equation, o -¯ 2 d2  h + (V - Ex ) = 0. 2m dx2 The independent solutions (, ) are normalized so that their Wronskian, W(, ) =  d/dx - d/dx , is scaled to give W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)] > 0. ( The nonlinearity of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi h equation induces this normalization upon W.) This ensures that (a2 + b2 + c) > 0. Also, the conjugate momentum is not the mechanical momentum, i.e., W/x = mx. We note for completeness that a particular  set (, ) of independent solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation may be chosen by the superposition principle o so that the coefficient c is zero. The motion in phase space is specified by Eq. (2). This phase-space trajectory is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The ± sign in Eq. (2) designates that the motion may be in either x-direction. The corresponding solution for the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, W , is given by W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 +K (3)

where K is an integration constant which we may set to zero herein. Hamilton's characteristic function is a generator of motion. The equation of motion in the domain [x, t] is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for a constant coordinate. The procedure simplifies for coordinates whose conjugate momenta are separation constants. For stationarity, Ex is a separation constant for time for a trajectory with normal incidence. Thus, the equation of motion for the trajectory time, t, relative to its constant coordinate  , is given as a function of x by t -  = W/Ex (4)

where the trajectory for a given energy, Ex , is a function of a set of coefficients (a, b, c) and  specifies the epoch. The equation of motion for the trajectory, Eq. (4), and the Bohmian equation of motion differ. Bohmian mechanics asserts that W/x in Eq. (1) would be the mechanical momentum, mx and the  subsequent integration of Eq. (1) would become Bohm's equation of motion [10]. Microstates: A particle with normal incidence and with sub-barrier energy, Ex , has its turning point at x =  where the Schr¨dinger wave function goes to a non-isolated zero [7,8]. In the generalized Hamiltono Jacobi representation, the barrier induces a nodal singularity at x =  in W/x [8]. From Eq. (2), W/x  0 as x  , regardless of the values of the coefficients a, b and c, because at least one independent solution of the set (, ), in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier, must increase without bound as x  . Each trajectory, which is specified by the particular values of the coefficients a, b and c, is a particular microstate of the Schr¨dinger wave function [7,8]. Each microstate, by itself, is sufficient to o specify the quantum results of a single event; there is no need to invoke an ensemble of microstates to describe quantum phenomenon [17]. Reflection: A set of independent solutions (, ) for our given semi-infinite rectangular barrier can be chosen as  x<0 1/4  cos[kx x + arctan(/kx )],  2m (5) · = exp(-x)  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4) , x  0.

(5) and (6) and where the dependence of the conjugate momentum upon energy, Ex , and the set of coefficients (a, b, c) is made explicit. By Eqs. (2), (5) and (6), W/x and  2 W/x2 are continuous across the barrier interface at x = 0. As expected, we see from Eq. (6) that the exp(x) term in  will induce a nodal singularity in W/x, Eq. (2), for any allowed values of the coefficients a, b and c at the trajectory's turning point at x = . We define the reflection time, tR , herein as the duration that a particle spends in the classically forbidden region inside the barrier, which is given by the round trip time for the particle between the barrier surface at x = 0 and the turning point at x = . From the equation of motion, Eq. (4), and Eqs. (3), (5) and (6), the reflection time, tR = 2[t() - t(0)], is given by tR = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] m . a + c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 ¯ kx h (7)

x<0 exp(-x) , x0 (6)

The reflection time, tR , is dependent upon the particular trajectory or microstate as specified by the coefficients a, b and c. We find that tR is inversely proportional to  consistent with Barton [18] who found that tunneling time, tT , decreased with increasing  for wave packets tunneling through inverted oscillator barriers. The reflection time is finite because  and kx are real and W 2 > 0. But the trajectory traverses an infinite distance between the interface at x = 0 and the turning point at x =  in a finite duration of time. Hence, the velocity along the trajectory must be infinite for a measurable duration of time. Note that this infinite velocity exists even though limx W/x  0 as already noted. (We discuss later an analogous effect in higher dimensions, cf. § 3, ¶ Trajectory Directions and Wave Normals). As already noted, all trajectories, regardless of the particular values of the coefficients, a, b and c have their turning point at x =  because the solution, W/x, to the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (1), has a nodal point there. The set of coefficients (a, b, c) can be specified the set of initial conditions (xo , xo , xo ) for a particle at some finite xo [7]. Even if we could not prescribe the set of initial conditions  ¨ (xo , xo , xo ) (due perhaps to limits of practicality, but not to any limits of principle for the trajectory repre ¨ sentation), then we would have to determine the distribution of the coefficients a, b and c. Any distribution of the reflection time, tR , over an ensemble of different microstates is due to the particular distribution of the coefficients a, b and c and not due to any adduced distribution of early turning points at finite depths as hypothesized by quantum interpretations that attribute a probability amplitude to . In general, these distributions will not be the same. Let us now examine tR for a particular case. Let us assume that a = b and c = 0. In such case, the reflection time, Eq. (7), becomes tR = 2m/(¯ kx ) = h/[Ex (U - Ex )]1/2 . h ¯ This finding for monochromatic propagation is consistent with findings for tunneling by wave packets. For rectangular barriers, Hauge and Stovneng [1] and Olkhovsky and Recami [3] have shown for phase times and for Larmor times respectfully that tR = tT where tT is tunneling time. For arbitrarily large thick barriers, 5

Hartman [19] has shown that tT  2m/(¯ kx ) for spatial Gaussian wave packets, and Fletcher [20] has h shown that tT = h/[Ex (U - Ex )]1/2 for wave packets with temporal exponential leading and trailing tails. ¯ As the trajectory representation is consistent with other work, we have confidence in applying it to less studied situations in § 3­5. Schr¨dinger Representation: We now investigate the corresponding Schr¨dinger representation for moo o nochromatic reflection by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. As all particles are reflected, the Schr¨dinger o wave function for the x-component can be represented by a real function within an arbitrary phase factor. The Schr¨dinger wave function, , can be represented in trigonometric form as [7,8] o (2m)1/4 cos(W/¯ ) h [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 (W/x)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 cos arctan [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 = .

where  and d/dx are continuous across the barrier interface at x = 0 as described by Eq. (5). While  =  where  is independent of the coefficients a, b and c, the generator of motion, W , for each particular trajectory (a microstate of ) is a function of the coefficients a, b and c is given by Eq. (3). Hence, the Schr¨dinger wave function, , is not an exhaustive description of reflection of a particle with sub-barrier o energy by a semi-infinite rectangular barrier. The intermediate steps in Eq. (8) systematically inject the coefficients (a, b, c) into the amplitude and phase of  so that  still remains independent of these coefficients. Nevertheless, (a, b, c) determine the microstate of . Each microstate of  has its distinguishing amplitude and phase modulation determined by the coefficients (a, b, c). We note that the Copenhagen interpretation asserts that  would be the exhaustive description of nonrelativistic quantum phenomenon. Therefore, the Copenhagen school would declare the intermediate steps in Eq. (8) to be extraphysical. Again, we apply the Schr¨dinger representation herein o without the Copenhagen interpretation. We can represent  in an exponential format as an alternative to Eq. (8) by = (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 2[a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 exp i arctan b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 + exp -i arctan b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2

where the first and second exponential terms represent respectfully the incident and reflected waves. Although  in its trigonometric representation, Eq. (8), is independent of the coefficients a, b and c, this is not the case for exponential case when the incident and reflected waves are considered individually. Neither the incident wave nor the reflected wave, when considered separately, are independent of these coefficients for [8,11] (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 b(/) + c/2 exp ±i arctan 2 /(4b)]1/2 2[a - c (ab - c2 /4)1/2 ib [1 ± ic/(4ab - c2 )1/2 ] ± .

When a = b and c = 0 as in the case studied by Hauge and Stovneng [1] and Olkhovsky and Recami [3], then in the classically allowed region, x < 0, the generator of motion simplifies to W (Ex , a, b, c, x)
a=b,c=0,x<0

= h arctan{tan[kx x + arctan(/kx )]}. ¯

This generator of the motion by Eq. (8) is, within a constant phase factor, consistent with an incident plane wave given by (2m)1/4 (kx - i) exp(ikx x), 2 2[¯ kx (kx + 2 )]1/2 h 6

and a reflected plane wave given by (2m)1/4 (kx + i) exp(-ikx x). 2 2[¯ kx (kx + 2 )]1/2 h This is the particular microstate, where a = b, and c = 0, that contemporary physics tacitly assumes when working in the Schr¨dinger representation [19,20]. This particular microstate manifests rectilinear o propagation for both the incident and reflected unmodulated plane waves. The incident and reflected waves for a more general microstate, where a = b or c = 0, have compound modulation in both amplitude and wavenumber by Eq. (9) [11,15]. These waves with compound modulation are still solutions to the Schr¨dinger o equation [11]. Underdetermination: As the Copenhagen interpretation does not entertain microstates of , the Copenhagen predictions for reflection time, tR , will differ with the trajectory predictions of reflection time, Eq. (7), which are dependent upon the microstate for the trajectory tR is a function of the coefficients (a, b, c). Bohmian Mechanics: As the x-component of the wave function is real within a constant phase factor, Bohmian mechanics asserts that W would be independent of x [10]. Therefore, Bohmian mechanics concludes that the particle would stand still at its initial position, inside or outside the barrier or at the barrier interface, and particle reflection would not occur.

OBLIQUE INCIDENCE

Trajectory Equation: Let us now examine the more general case of oblique incidence. We can always choose our cartesian coordinate system so that the trajectory lies in the x, y-plane. The generalized HamiltonJacobi equation and the Schr¨dinger equation are separable in cartesian coordinates. In a Hamilton-Jacobi o representation, the cartesian coordinate y is cyclic with a transformed constant y-momentum given by h ¯ ky . (This prescribes that y-motion is constant or the y-component in the Schr¨dinger representation is an o unmodulated wave.) The cartesian coordinate z is also cyclic but the transformed constant z-momentum is zero for our choice of orientation for the coordinate system. The generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for oblique incidence is given by (W/x)2 + (W/y)2 h ¯2 +V -E =- W;x 2m 4m where E is the energy for a particle with oblique incidence. As y-momentum is constant, any contribution due to a latent W ; y is zero. The solution for the generator of the motion is given by W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 + hky y. ¯ (10)

In the above,  and  are still given by Eqs. (5) and (6) respectfully, but where now kx = and = 2m(U - E) 2 + ky h ¯2

where E is constrained so that kx and  are real. Equation (2) is still valid for W/x. 7

The trajectory equation, which describes the progress of the trajectory along the cyclic coordinate y as a function of x, is the equation of motion produced by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for the constant (reference) coordinate yo given by y - yo = -W/(¯ ky ). h (11)

Goos-H¨nchen Displacement: The lateral displacement, y, between where the trajectory enters and a exits the barrier is known as the Goos-H¨nchen displacement [12]. By the trajectory equation, Eq. (11), the a Goos-H¨nchen displacement, y = 2[y() - y(0)], is given by a y = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] ky . a + c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 kx

Hence, the Goos-H¨nchen displacement, for a given energy E and a given ky , is a function of the coefficients a a, b and c. Analogous to the time of reflection, y is inversely proportional to  and kx . The Goos-H¨nchen a effect gives us an alternative to reflection time for describing the quantum effects of reflection. Trajectory Directions and Wave Normals: We already know that the turning point for the trajectory is at x =  inside the semi-infinite barrier. We now investigate the behavior of the trajectory near the turning point by studying Eq. (11) there. As the trajectory approaches the turning point, we have that W/x goes to zero as lim ky x exp(-2x) W . - 4(ab - c2 /4)1/2 (¯ ky ) h kx 1 + (/kx )2 (12)

x

Thus, as x  , the trajectory becomes asymptotic to the x-direction regardless of the values of the coefficients a, b and c. Nevertheless, how W/x goes to zero is still a function of the coefficients a, b and c. Hence, the turning point at x =  for the trajectory is a symmetric cusp in the x, y-plane for all allowed values of a, b and c. This is just another manifestation that W/x has a nodal singularity for a particle with sub-barrier energy reflecting from a semi-infinite barrier. A symmetric cusp for a turning point at infinity, which is formed by its two branches with mirror symmetry of each other that approach a common asymptote, is consistent with traversing an infinite displacement in x while transversing only a finite distance y. It is also consistent with a Schr¨dinger wave function that decreases exponentially in the classically forbidden o region. Meanwhile, the wave normal is given by W . From Eq. (10), the wave normal is W = (2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1^ + hky ^. i ¯  (13)

At the turning point, we know that limx (a2 + b2 + c)-1 = 0 because at least one solution of the set of independent solutions (, ) must increase without bound at the turning point at x = . Thus, we conclude from Eqs. (12) and (13) that the trajectory's direction at the turning point is embedded in a surface of constant W because the wave normal is orthogonal to the trajectory. This is a manifestation that the trajectories are not stream lines of a hydrodynamic representation of quantum mechanics. We also conclude that, when the trajectory direction is embedded in a surface of constant W, its velocity increases without bound (cf. § 2, ¶ Reflection). Underdetermination: The Goos-H¨nchen displacement, y, renders a better case than tR to resolve the a underdetermination issue because the Schr¨dinger representation has an operator for y but does not have one o for time t. Thus, both the trajectory representation and the Copenhagen have the means to determine y. Again as the Copenhagen interpretation does not entertain microstates of , the Copenhagen predictions for Goos-H¨nchen displacement, y, will differ with the trajectory predictions of Goos-H¨nchen displacement, a a Eq. (7), which are dependent upon the microstate for the trajectory y is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). 8

Bohmian Mechanics: As the x-component of the wave function is real within a constant phase factor, Bohmian mechanics asserts that W would be independent of x [10]. Therefore, Bohmian mechanics concludes that the particle would travel in the y-direction only and would never reflect off the barrier.

SQUARE WELLS

Let us now investigate reflection inside square wells as an extension of reflection from semi-infinite rectangular barriers. The potential for a square well may be given by V (x) = U, 0, |x| > q |x|  q (14)

where q is finite positive and where Ex , U, kx and  maintain their previous definitions. A finite square well always has at least one symmetric bound state. While our results, Eqs. (17) and (18), are valid for both symmetric and antisymmetric bound states, we discuss only the symmetric bound states to shorten the presentation. We could have arbitrarily chosen to present only the antisymmetric (or odd) bound states just as easily except that not all square wells have sufficient size, that is (2mU )1/2 q/¯ > /2, to ensure that h an antisymmetric bound state exists. For bound states, Ex < U . Energy is quantized for symmetric bound states by the familiar transcendental equation tan(kx q) = /kx , which can be established from either the quantization of the action variable, J, for symmetric states by [17] J= W/x dx = (2n + 1)h, n = 0, 1, 2, · · · and n < (2mU )1/2 q/¯ h

or the quantization energy, Ex , so that |x=± = 0. In either case, the quantization is independent of the coefficients a, b and c [7]. The set of independent solutions (, ) for this square well is chosen such that  represents the symmetric bound state given by  x>q  cos(kx q) exp[-(x - q)],  1/4  2m cos(kx x), -q  x  q · (15) =  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4)   cos(kx q) exp[(x + q)] x < -q. The other solution, , is unbound and is not unique as any amount of  may be added to it. While  is symmetric for the symmetric bound state, the corresponding  that we have chosen is antisymmetric. We present this unbound solution as   exp[(x - q)] - cos(2kx q) exp[-(x + a)]  , x>q   2 sin(kx q) 1/4   2m sin(kx x), -q  x  q · = (16)  h 2 ¯ 2 kx (ab - c2 /4)  cos(2k q) exp[(x + q)] - exp[-(x + q)]  x   , x < -q.  2 sin(kx q) The corresponding Wronskian obeys W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 as expected. For bound states, h microstates of the Schr¨dinger wave function exist where the particular choice of the set of coefficients o (a, b, c) specifies a unique trajectory in phase space for a given quantized energy Ex [8]. By Eqs. (3), (4), (15) and (16) and by the quantizing condition tan(kx q) = /kx , we can evaluate the reflection time, t±R , as the time for the round trip between the barrier interface at x = ±q and the turning point at x = ±. The reflection time, t±R = 2|t(±q) - t(±)|, is finite for traversing an infinite distance as given by t±R = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] m a ± c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 ¯ kx h 9

(17)

where the sign for the coefficient c in the denominator is dependent upon which interface, x = ±q, is applicable. The trajectory for the microstate will not be symmetric for c = 0 for our choice of (, ). The existence of unsymmetric microstates of symmetric Schr¨dinger wave functions has already been discussed o elsewhere [5]. Otherwise, Eqs. (7) and (17) are very similar. We note that t+R and t-R are constant of the motion. For completeness, we present the trajectory's period for a complete libration cycle for a bound microstate in our square well. This libration period, tLibration = 2|t() - t(-)|, for a microstate is given from Eqs. (3), (4), (15) and (16) and the quantizing condition tan(kx q) = /kx by tLibration = 4 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ][a + b(/kx )2 ] m(q + -1 ) . a2 + (2ab - c2 )(/kx )2 + b2 (/kx )4 h ¯ kx (18)

So the libration period is a function of the coefficients a, b and c even though, as shown elsewhere [7], the action variable and energy are not. For any allowed set of coefficients (a, b, c), tLibration is always finite. We note that tLibration is another constant of the motion. In Bohmian mechanics, the one-dimensional bound state is the archetype for a particle standing still in its original position [10]. We defer further comments on underdetermination until our investigation of square well ducts.

5

SQUARE WELL DUCTS:

Let us consider a duct whose axis in two dimension (x, y) is aligned along the y-axis. The potential, V (x), that forms the duct is still the square well potential given by Eq. (14). The cartesian coordinate y is cyclic with a transformed constant y-momentum given by hky as was the case oblique incidence given in § 3. The ¯ generator of the motion and the equation of motion are given by Eqs. (10) and (11) respectively where the potential is given by Eq. (14). The Goos-H¨nchen displacement, y±R = 2|y(±q) - y(±)|, is given by a y±R = 2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] ky a ± c(/kx ) + b(/kx )2 kx (19)

where the sign for the subscript of y and the coefficient c in the denominator is dependent upon which interface, x = ±q, is applicable. The corresponding distance transversed in y by the trajectory during a libration period, yLibration = 2|y() - y(-)|, for a microstate is given from Eqs. (3), (4), (15) and (16) and the quantizing condition tan(kx q) = /kx by yLibration = 4 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ][a + b(/kx )2 ] ky (q + -1 ) . a2 + (2ab - c2 )(/kx )2 + b2 (/kx )4 kx (20)

We now know how the trajectory (microstate) in a duct behaves according to its set of coefficients (a, b, c). In order to resolve underdetermination, we shall now develop a proposed test whether an observed overdetermined set of constants of the motion, that is accessible to the Copenhagen interpretation, is consistent with theoretical redundancy. While we have been able for a given Ex or J to describe the set of coefficients (a, b, c) in terms of the set of initial conditions [xo , xo , xo ] in the spirit of Hamilton, the Copenhagen school would argue that we cannot  ¨ measure these initial conditions simultaneously due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (but we could identify either x or x; note that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle does not address x). The Copenhagen  ¨ school would conclude that we can specify neither the coefficients a, b and c nor subsequently the microstate, which is consistent with Copenhagen postulate that  is an exhaustive description of nonrelativistic quantum phenomena. In the following three paragraphs, the set of coefficients (a, b, c) shall be specified by another set of constants of the motion that are measurable by the Copenhagen school. We can also express the set of coefficients (a, b, c) in terms of constants of the motion in the spirit of Jacobi. (Note that the coefficients a, b and c are, in their own right, constants of the motion.) The constants 10

of the motion Ex and J are independent of (a, b, c) [7]. Let us survey what other constants of the motion we have that are dependent on the coefficients (a, b, c). The Wronskian, W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab-c2 /4)], provides h such a constant of the motion. In addition, y+ , y+ and yLibration are all such constants of the motion. Also, there exists a constant of the motion, I, which is an Ermakov invariant established by the Ermakov system formed by the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (1), and the Schr¨dinger equation. This o constant of the motion is given for bound states by [17] I = {W   2 + (¯ 2 /W  )[W  /(2W  ) +   ]2 }/(2m)1/2 h = [a - c2 /(4b)]-1 = b¯ 2 W 2 /(2m) > 0. h Hence, I is positive definite for bound states (it is zero for unbound states) [17]. We may, for a given E or J, describe the microstate in terms of other constants of the motion instead of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). This would remove the Copenhagen school's objection regarding specifying the set of coefficients (a, b, c) by the set of initial conditions [xo , xo , xo ]. Three independent constants of the  ¨ motion are necessary and sufficient to specify the set of coefficients (a, b, c). We have already developed a redundant set of five constants of the motion (I, W, y+ , y- , yLibration ) that have been expressed herein as functions of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The set (b, W, I) is redundant as b can be specified by b= The coefficients a and c are specified by a= and c= ky (2m)1/2 [1 + (/kx )2 ] h ¯W2 kx 1 1 - y+ y- . (2m)1/2 ky [1 + (/kx )2 ] 2 h ¯W kx 1 1 + y+ y- - 2mI h ¯W2  kx
2

2m I . h ¯2 W2

The set of Goos-H¨nchen displacements (y+ , y- ) and yLibration ) are measurable in the Copenhagen a interpretation for there is an operator for y in the Schr¨dinger representation. The Copenhagen school may o still demurer with the objection that the set (I, W, a, c) is redundant and that we need one more constant of the motion independent of this set to specify the set (a, b, c) by accessible measurements. The set of initial conditions provides us this other constant. The Copenhagen school must stipulate that we can know either xo or xo by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and perhaps even also know xo . Thus, the set (y+ , y- , )  ¨ where  is either xo or xo determines the set (a, b, c) in a means acceptable to the Copenhagen school.  We can now specify the microstate and consequently the trajectory for a particle in a way acceptable to the Copenhagen school. We still have the constant of the motion, yLibration , which has not been used to specify the set of coefficients (a, b, c). With the addition of yLibration , we have overdetermined the set of coefficients (a, b, c). We may now propose a test of whether the observed overdetermination of a microstate is consistent with the theoretical redundancy in the set of constants of the motion (yLibration , y+ , y- , ) where  is either xo or xo . This set is accessible to the Copenhagen school. Thus, this redundancy is a strong  test for resolving the underdetermination issue. If observation is consistent with the theoretical dependence among the super-sufficient set of constants of the motion, then microstates are so, and the Copenhagen interpretation is in variance.

Engineering two-mode interactions in ion traps
J. Steinbach, J. Twamley, and P.L. Knight
Optics Section, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College, London SW7 2BZ, United Kingdom (April 8, 1997) We describe how two vibrational degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion can be coupled through the action of suitably-chosen laser excitation. We concentrate on a two-dimensional ion trap with dissimilar vibrational frequencies in the x- and y-directions of motion, and derive from first principles a variety of quantized two-mode couplings, concentrating on a linear coupling which takes excitations from one mode to another. We demonstrate how this can result in a state rotation, in which it is possible to transfer the motional state of the ion from say the x-direction to the y-direction without prior knowledge of that motional state. 03.75.Be

(2) (3)

In recent years advances in the cooling and trapping of ions have led to a situation in which the centre-of-mass (CM) motion of trapped ions has to be treated quantum mechanically [1]. This motion can be coherently controlled by coupling the ion's external and internal degrees of freedom through laser irradiation [2­6]. Systems of trapped ions have been employed to demonstrate experimentally the generation and measurement of nonclassical states of the ion's CM motion [7­10]. Furthermore trapped ions have been used to implement quantum logic gates [11­13]. Most of the previous investigations have focussed on the one-dimensional quantum motion of trapped ions. Recently, Gou et. al. [14­18] considered the generation of particular two-mode states of an ion. In this paper we address the issue of how to engineer a class of interactions between two of the quantized motional degrees of freedom of a single trapped ion. We assume that the ion is confined within a trap potential that can be closely approximated by a two-dimensional harmonic well. In this case the CM motion of the ion is completely equivalent to that of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, characterized by two frequencies of oscillation a and b in orthogonal directions x and y, and the corresponding operators a (^) and ^ (^ create (annihilate) vibrational ^ a b b) excitations in the x- and y-directions. The interaction that we want to engineer is of the parametric form
k ka ^ b ^ b HI = h g a ^kb + g  aka ^ b ¯ ^

,

(1)

where ka and kb are positive integers and g is a complex coupling constant. In particular, we note that the powers ka , and kb , can be independently controlled to take on any positive integer numbers, and the phase of the coupling constant g, is freely adjustable. To give specific examples of this class of interactions between the two vibrational modes a and b, we address the two coupling Hamiltonians, 1

The Hamiltonian (2) generates an active rotation of the two-dimensional quantized motional state of the ion at ^ (1) a frequency g, where g is real. Here HI is the kind of Hamiltonian associated with a linear coupler or beam splitter in optics (see e.g. [19] and refs. therein). There, a photon in mode a is annihilated and a photon in mode b is created, and vice versa. In a trapped ion, vibrational anticorrelated SU(2) states of motion characteristic of this kind of linear coupling can be generated [14]. ^ (1) The linear coupling, HI , makes it possible to transfer the motional state of the ion from, say the x-direction into the y-direction without prior knowledge of that motional state and irrespective of whether it is a pure or a mixed state. In the situation in which one may want to use the quantized motion in the x-direction for quantum computation [11­13], perhaps later entangling the quantum state of motion with internal electronic states, the y-direction can then be employed as a quantum memory element. Note the key point here is that states of motion in the x-direction can be transferred entirely to the y-direction without reading out their nature, entirely ^ (3) non-destructively. The Hamiltonian HI is of the threephoton down-conversion kind: in optics, it represents a process in which one pump photon in mode b is annihilated and three photons in mode a are created, and vice versa. This process is known to be highly peculiar: unlike its two-photon down-conversion cousin, quantization of the pump is essential to avoid pathological divergences [20]. These are avoided in a fully quantized treatment, where the pump and down-converted field modes become highly entangled [21]. In section II, we first introduce a two-mode Raman transition which couples the electronic and motional degrees of freedom of the ion. Choosing the initial state of the ion to be a direct product of an arbitrary motional state and a specific electronic state, we then decouple

the electronic and motional dynamics of the ion through a particular configuration of laser beams (section III). In the Lamb-Dicke approximation and in the limit of suitable trap anisotropy we obtain the above Hamiltonian (1) for various sideband detunings of the lasers. We then examine the severity of the approximations made to obtain the Hamiltonian (1). In section IV we obtain analytical estimates regarding the effects of off-resonant and higher on-resonant processes. In section V we specialize to the ^ (1) case ka = kb = 1, and show that the Hamiltonian HI rotates the motional quantum state of the ion. Finally, we perform a numerical analysis of the complete quantum dynamics and find that the Hamiltonian (2) can be accurately engineered over a range of parameters.

II. GENERAL TWO-MODE RAMAN COUPLING

In the following we describe the Raman coupling which we use to engineer the Hamiltonian given in (1). We consider an effective three-level ion in a configuration, confined within a two-dimensional harmonic trap as illustrated in Fig.1. The trap is characterized by the two frequencies a and b which describe the harmonic potential in x- and y-direction respectively. As shown in Fig.1, the ion is excited by two linearly polarized laser beams which propagate in the x- and y-directions connecting levels |1  |2 and |2  |3 . These beams are far detuned from the excited state |2 , in order to generate a stimulated Raman transition between the two states |1 and |3 . We assume states |1 and |3 to be ground state hyperfine sublevels.
(a) (b)

We do not include decoherence effects in our model for the following reason. The Raman coupled energy level scheme greatly suppresses the spontaneous emission between the two ground state levels |3 and |1 as these states are coupled by M1 and E2 transitions at best. At the same time we neglect the effects of spontaneous emission from level |2 , as the coupling to the excited state can be effectively eliminated over the timescales of interest to us here when the laser beams are far detuned. Another source of decoherence in ion trap experiments is classical noise in the laser beams and trapping potential. This may be described using so-called intrinsic decoherence models, e.g. [22], of dephasing. The effects of this kind of decoherence have been seen in a recent experiment by Meekhof et. al. [7]. However, they expect to significantly reduce decoherence from classical noise sources in future experiments [23]. We thus do not include any decoherence effects in our model. Treating the laser excitations classically, the two electric fields are described by
^ E 12 (^, t) = e12 E12 e-i[k12 x-12 t] + h.c. , x ^ y E 23 (^, t) = e23 E23 e-i[k23 y-23 t] + h.c. ,

where e12 and e23 are polarization vectors, k12 and k23 are wavenumbers, and 12 and 23 are the frequencies of the lasers. We assume the laser phases to be absorbed in the complex amplitudes E12 and E23 . In dipole approximation this leads to the Hamiltonian ^ H = h1 |1 1| + h2 |2 2| + h3 |3 3| ¯ ¯ ¯ + ha (^ a) + hb (^ ^ ¯ a ^ ¯ b b) - D12 .E 12 - D23 .E 23 , (5)

III. SPECIFIC COUPLING SCHEME

(8)

In this section we construct a particular configuration of Raman lasers to decouple the electronic and motional dynamics of the trapped ion for suitably-chosen initial electronic states. This is done by symmetrically combining two Raman transitions as described below. We then obtain the Hamiltonian (1) in the Lamb-Dicke approximation and in the limit of suitable trap anisotropy for specific sideband detunings of the lasers. The electronic and motional dynamics can be decou^ ^ pled in general for the Hamiltonian HI = M  |1 3| + ^   |3 1|, where M may be any operator that acts ^ M on the motional degrees of freedom only. This is done through the addition of another interaction generated by ^ ^ ^ HI = M  |3 1| + M   |1 3|. Combining both inter^ tot = HI + H  , so that the combined ^ ^ actions, we have HI I ^ tot = (M + M  )  (|3 1| + |1 3|), fac^ ^ Hamiltonian, HI ^ ^ torizes. For the case where HI is given by (12), HI can be generated by an extra pair of Raman lasers with suitable detunings, propagation directions and phases. To be more specific, we require a symmetric combination of two Raman transitions, so that  = -13 , 13
 12 = -12 ,  23 = -23 ,   g13 = g13 ,

where we have dropped the term describing the free energy of the excited state |2 as in the far detuned limit (7) the excited state is no longer connected to the two ground states. Furthermore, we have defined the Raman coupling constant
 g13 = g12 g23

and the energies h1 and h3 of the ground state lev¯ ¯ els |1 and |3 , which are Stark shifted as a result of the adiabatic elimination of the excited state, are 1 = 1 - 2|g12 |2 , 12 2|g23 |2 3 = 3 - . 23

In order to proceed, we will consider the Raman cou^ pling Hamiltonian (8) in the interaction picture of H0 =  ^ ^ and transh ¯ 1 |1 1| + h3 |3 3| + ha (^ a) + hb (b b), ¯ ¯ a ^ ¯ form to the new Hamiltonian

(11) where all quantities without primes correspond to the first pair of Raman lasers and all primed quantities refer to the second pair. If, for the first pair of lasers, the Raman detuning 13 is given by (13), then the first condition (14), requires an appropriate choice of   the frequencies 12 and 23 for the second pair, so that    = 12 - 23 - (3 - 1 ) = -13 . This is illustrated 13 in Fig.2. The second condition (15), is satisfied by choosing the second pair of beams to be counter-propagating  with respect to the first pair, so that k12 = -k12 , and  k23 = -k23 , as seen from the definition of the LambDicke parameters, 12 = x0 k12 , and 23 = y0 k23 .  Here, we have neglected the differences |k12 | - |k12 |,    and |k23 | - |k23 |, since |12 - 12 |  12 , 12 , and   |23 - 23 |  23 , 23 . This restriction can be lifted if one chooses the second pair of lasers to be not exactly counter-propagating with the first. The third condition (16), requires a suitable choice of laser phases for the two pairs of Raman beams which can be easily read from (9). The symmetric combination of the two Raman transitions as specified by (14)­(16) then leads to the interaction Hamiltonian 3

In doing so and replacing the position operators x and y ^ ^ by (6) we obtain the interaction Hamiltonian 1 2 2 ^ HI = -¯ g13 exp - (12 + 23 ) h 2  |1 3|

where we have defined the Raman detuning, 13 = 12 - 23 - (3 - 1 ) , (13)

and the Lamb-Dicke parameters in x- and y-direction, 12 = x0 k12 , and 23 = y0 k23 . The square of the Lamb-Dicke parameter gives the ratio of the single photon recoil energy to the energy level spacing in the harmonic oscillator potential.

which factorizes. We now assume the ion to be initially in a direct product of its motional and electronic state with the  electronic state prepared as |+ = (|1 + |3 )/ 2. This superposition state |+ , can be prepared from the ground state |1 , by applying a resonant /2-pulse (13 = 0), if the ion is confined within the Lamb-Dicke limit, i.e. 12 , 23  1, [9]. The dynamics generated by eq.(17) acting on this state factors and leaves the electronic state unchanged. This allows us to reduce the dynamics to that of the motional degrees of freedom only, and we write 1 2 2 ^ tot HI = -¯ g13 exp - (12 + 23 ) h 2 (-i12 )m+µ (i23 )n+ m µ ^ n a a b b ^ m! µ! n! ! + h.c.

From eq.(12) it is clear that by fixing the size of the detuning 13 , i.e. by choosing the frequencies of the two coupling lasers, we can tune to a resonance between specific vibronic levels. As illustrated in Fig.3 we introduce a virtual level |c with energy hc to help visualize the Ra¯ man transitions between the ion's vibronic levels. If we let 12 = (c -1 )-ka a , and 23 = (c -3 )-kb b , then with respect to level |c , the first laser is tuned to the ka th red sideband of the ion's vibration in the x-direction, the second laser is tuned to the kb -th red sideband of the vibration in the y-direction and the Raman detuning is 13 = kb b - ka a . (19)

FIG. 2. Schematic diagram of two symmetric Raman transitions which in combination decouple the electronic and motional dynamics of the trapped ion for suitably-chosen initial electronic states. In (a), the frequencies 12 and 23 of the two lasers that generate the stimulated Raman transition between the ground state levels |1 and |3 are chosen such that the Raman detuning 13 = 12 - 23 - (3 - 1 ) is positive. The coupling lasers are red detuned with respect to the |1  |3 transition. In (b), we show the symmetric Raman transition to (a). The frequencies   12 and 23 of the coupling lasers are adjusted so that    13 = 12 - 23 - (3 - 1 ) = -13 . The coupling beams are blue detuned with respect to the |1  |3 transition. For the two transitions to be symmetric we additionally require the coupling beams in (b) to be counter-propagating with respect to the beams in (a).

This situation is illustrated in Fig.3 for the specific example, ka = kb = 1. Now, if only on-resonant terms in (12) are retained, we have m = µ + ka , and n =  + kb , and we obtain the Hamiltonian ^ HI = |1 3|  h ¯ g(µ, ) a ^

We now discuss the sideband detunings which, in the Lamb-Dicke approximation and in the limit of suitable trap anisotropy, lead to the desired interaction (1). In particular, detuning the two pairs of Raman lasers to specific vibrational sidebands allows us to choose specific values for ka and kb in (1). Since we require the two Raman transitions to be symmetric, it is sufficient to consider the first pair of Raman lasers. Therefore, we return to the vibronic Raman coupling Hamiltonian (12). 4

This is a two-mode generalization of the nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model introduced by Vogel et. al. [4]. It is important for the trap frequencies a and b to be non-commensurate to arrive at this result. This becomes clear from Fig.3.

for the motional dynamics of the trapped ion as discussed above. In the last step, we now assume the Lamb-Dicke limit, where 12 , 23  1. In this limit we approximate eq.(22) by keeping only the lowest order terms in 12 and 23 . From eq.(21), these are the terms µ =  = 0, and we obtain

FIG. 3. Schematic diagram of the vibronic energy levels that are connected by the two laser beams which generate the stimulated Raman transition. The two Raman lasers are tuned such that the Raman detuning 13 = kb b - ka a , with ka = kb = 1. With respect to the virtual level |c , the laser propagating in the x-direction is tuned to the first red sideband of the ion's vibration in the x-direction and the laser that propagates in the y-direction is tuned to the first red sideband of the ion's vibration in the y-direction. This causes a resonant transition between the vibronic states |na - 1 a |nb b |3  |na a |nb - 1 b |1 , where the states |na a |nb b denote the usual number state basis for the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the numbers na and nb give the number of vibrational excitations in the xand y-direction respectively.

where g = g(0, 0), is given in (21). The above Hamiltonian (23) realizes the desired interaction (1), between the two modes a and b of the ion's motion in the x- and y-direction. We note that the coupling constant g depends on the Lamb-Dicke parameters through the factor ka kb 12 23 . Consequently for fixed laser power, i.e. fixed |g12 | and |g23 |, and small Lamb-Dicke parameters, the coupling strength may be very small. One can increase the coupling constant g by increasing the laser power while at the same time maintaining inequality (7). This permits us to ignore the spontaneous emission from the excited state |2 on a timescale T  Tspont = |g12 |2 |g23 |2 + 2 2 12 23

If the trapping potential is isotropic, a = b , and the energy levels become degenerate. Consequently, the Raman transition Hamiltonian (12) contains on-resonant terms in addition to the ones retained in (20). In the example ka = kb = 1, this leads to a coupling Hamiltonian ^ HI  [1+ 2 (^ ^ a ^ -^ a -^ ^ a b+^ b a ^ b b)+O( 4 )]|1 3|+h.c. , where we have assumed the Lamb-Dicke parameters to be of the same order of magnitude, 12  23  . In general, if the frequencies a and b are commensurate the Raman transition Hamiltonian (12) contains resonances in addition to the ones considered in eq.(20). As we will show in the next section, in the Lamb-Dicke limit, the coupling constants corresponding to these additional resonances can be greatly reduced by increasing the ratio of the trap frequencies, a /b . The symmetric Raman transition (20) is generated by a second pair of lasers as specified in eqs.(14)­(16). In particular, we note that (14) can be satisfied with the   choice 12 = (c - 1 )+ka a , and 23 = (c - 3 )+kb b , for the frequencies of the second pair of lasers. With respect to the virtual level |c , these lasers are then detuned by the same amount as the first pair but to the blue vi5

where  is the rate of spontaneous decay from level |2 [24]. This is important as the decoupling of the motional and electronic dynamics relies on maintaining the coherence of the electronic degrees of freedom. In section V we will compare the timescales for spontaneous emission and the Raman-generated motional dynamics for the specific case of rotation (2), given the parameters of recent experiments [7].

IV. LIMITATIONS

In this section we further discuss the approximations under which the Hamiltonian (23), gives a valid description of the system dynamics. First, we address the size of the corrections that we have neglected in the LambDicke approximation. We then show that the coupling constants of the additional resonances in the case of commensurate trap frequencies can be made as small as these corrections for a suitably large ratio of the trap frequencies, a /b . Finally, we discuss the limitations imposed on our Hamiltonians from neglecting off-resonant transitions.

A. Lamb-Dicke approximation

From the previous section it is clear that the LambDicke limit is an important requirement for us to engineer the desired interaction (23). The Lamb-Dicke approximation led us from (22) to (23) under the assumption 12 , 23  1. We note that both (22) and (23) couple the same vibrational states |m a |n + kb

where |m a |n b , denotes the usual number state basis for the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Therefore, we do not neglect any additional resonances between other states than the ones given in (25) by making the LambDicke approximation. We define the Lamb-Dicke approximation for suitably small 12 , 23 to be the approximation where all terms in (22) of order  2 smaller than the leading term are neglected i.e. |g(µ, )|  O( 2 ) , |g(0, 0)| (26)

where we have assumed the Lamb-Dicke parameters to be of the same order of magnitude, 12  23  . It is important to note that the orthogonality of the Raman laser beams shown in Fig.1 is not essential. In fact, the size of the Lamb-Dicke parameters can be reduced by changing the geometry of the lasers and choosing the two Raman beams to be almost counterpropagating. In this situation the wave vectors k12 and k 23 of the two Raman beams have to be added and the numbers k12 and k23 in (8) are then the projections of k = k12 + k 23 onto the x- and y-axes respectively.

FIG. 4. Vibronic energy level diagram for the case of the two trap frequencies a and b being multiples of each other, a = 5 b . As in Fig.3 the two Raman lasers are tuned such that the Raman detuning 13 = kb b - ka a , with ka = kb = 1. In addition to the desired resonant transition |na - 1 a |nb b |3  |na a |nb - 1 b |1 , shown in grey, the |na a |nb - 4 b |3  |na a |nb b |1 transition is resonantly coupled as shown in black. In the Lamb-Dicke limit, the coupling constant corresponding to this additional resonance can be reduced to the size of the corrections to the Lamb-Dicke approximation for the desired resonance by increasing the ratio of the trap frequencies, a /b .

We start by deriving the resonances that occur if the two trap frequencies a and b are multiples of each other. Without loss of generality we choose a = l b , (28)

B. Trap anisotropy

As we have mentioned in the previous section, even in the case of an anisotropic trap, there are on-resonant terms in addition to the ones included in (20) when the trap frequencies are commensurate. This is illustrated in Fig.4, where a = 5 b , and again, ka = kb = 1. In addition to the |m - 1 a |n b |3  |m a |n - 1 b |1 transition shown in Fig.3, the |m a |n - 4 b |3  |m a |n b |1 transition is resonantly coupled as in Fig.4. In the following we show that in the Lamb-Dicke limit, the coupling constants g, corresponding to these additional resonances satisfy |g|  O( 2 ) , |g(0, 0)| (27)

where l is a positive integer number. In deriving the interaction (23) the laser frequencies were chosen to give the detunings 13 = kb b - ka a , and  = ka a - kb b , 13 for the two pairs of coupling beams respectively. We will explicitly consider only the first of these two cases, i.e. 13 = kb b - ka a , since the second follows analogously by interchanging the operators a  a , and ^  ^ , and ^ ^ b b leads to the same limits for the trap ratio l = a /b . Now, with (28), the resonance condition in (12) becomes - l (µ - m) - (n - ) - l ka + kb = 0 , (29)

where all numbers are positive integers. In order to simplify the discussion we categorize the resonances by introducing an integer number N, and rewrite (29), so that µ - m = -ka + N ,  - n = -kb + l N . (30)

if the ratio of the trap frequencies is chosen large enough. These additional terms can thus be neglected in the Lamb-Dicke approximation. 6

Following this categorization, we divide the resonances determined by (29) into the three cases, [1 ] N = 0, [2 ]

N positive, and [3 ] N negative. We subdivide case [2 ] further into [2a] (i ) (ii ) [2b] (i ) (ii ) 0 < N  ka 0 < N  ka N > ka N > ka and 0 < N l  kb , and N l > kb ,

expression, we consider the factor containing the LambDicke parameters and the one containing the factorials separately. If 12  23  , we have (23 )lN -2kb   N (l-1)-2kb   2 , (12 )N (35)

and 0 < N l  kb , and N l > kb .

Below we will examine the cases [1 ] and [2a](ii) in detail as the later case contains resonances with the largest contribution besides the required resonance at N = 0. We have examined the other cases and will not repeat their analysis except to note that they all give rise to leading order corrections of order higher than those found in case [2a](ii) in . Thus, to obtain the desired Hamiltonian (23), the resonances in case [2a](ii) will impose the most stringent condition on the size of the trap ratio l = a /b . Throughout this discussion we will consider only the lowest order terms in the Lamb-Dicke parameters, since we have already addressed the size of the corrections to the Lamb-Dicke approximation in the above. In case [1 ], we have N = 0, so that from the resonance condition in (30) we obtain µ - m = -ka , and  - n = -kb . This is the case which leads us to the desired interaction (23), and which we have discussed in the previous section. We now consider case [2a](ii). Here, we have 0 < N  ka , and N l > kb , so that from (30) we obtain m = µ + ka - N  µ ,  = n + l N - kb > n .

which is satisfied if, N (l - 1) - 2kb  2. Since this condition has to hold for all N in the range 0 < N  ka , this leads to the requirement l  2kb + 3 , (36)

for the trap ratio l. Next, we consider the term including the factorials. We require this term to be smaller or equal to unity as under the above condition (36) the factor containing the Lamb-Dicke parameters already satisfies (35). We have ka ! kb ! ka ! kb ! (ka + kb )!   , (ka - N )! (kb - l N )! (l N - kb )! (l N - kb )! (37) where in the first inequality we made use of the fact that for the resonances we are discussing here, 0 < N  ka , and the second inequality holds since, (ka +kb )!  ka ! kb !, for all positive integers ka and kb . From the above inequality (37) the factor containing the Lamb-Dicke parameters is smaller or equal to unity if, (l N - kb )!  (ka + kb )!, and since this has to be satisfied for all N in the range 0 < N  ka , we require l  2kb + ka . (38) Depending on the interaction that we want to generate, i.e. depending on the number ka , the inequality (36) or (38) will impose the stronger limit on the trap anisotropy. For the two examples given in (2) and (3), we have ka = kb = 1, and ka = 3, kb = 1, respectively. Therefore, in order to generate the linear coupling Hamiltonian (2) we require the trap ratio l = a /b  5, (36). For the cubic interaction (3) a trap ratio of l = a /b  5, is needed from (38). For the remaining cases [2a](i), [2b](i), [2b](ii) and [3 ] a similar analysis shows that the requirements (36) and (38) are sufficient to limit the strength of these resonances to (27). Although in the above discussion we have explicitly assumed the two trap frequencies a and b to be multiples of each other, the limits (36) and (38) also hold for commensurate trap frequencies. In this case the trap ratio is a rational number, i.e. l = p/q, where p and q are positive integers. Since in the resonance condition (30) all numbers need to be integers, the number N which categorizes the resonances can only take on multiple values of q, so that l N = p N/q, is an integer. As we have discussed all integer values of N, any trap ratio l = p/q, which satisfies the inequalities (36) and (38) suffices for the unwanted resonances to satisfy (27). Hence, for given 7

(31)

Inserting these identities into (12) and keeping only the lowest order terms in the Lamb-Dicke approximation, i.e. µ = n = 0, we obtain
ka -N l N -kb ^ ^ |1 3| + h.c. , b HI = h g a  ¯ ^

(32)

where we have defined the coupling constant 1 2 (-i12 )ka -N (i23 )l N -kb 2 g = -g13 exp - (12 + 23 ) . 2 (ka - N )! (l N - kb )! (33) We require the coupling constants of the above resonances (31) to be smaller than or equal to the coupling constants of the terms that we have neglected in the Lamb-Dicke limit (27). Therefore, we have the condition |g| kb ! (23 )lN -2kb ka !  2 , = |g(0, 0)| (ka - N )! (kb - l N )! (12 )N

(34)

where again, we assume both Lamb-Dicke parameters to be of the same order of magnitude, 12  23  . In order to derive a limit for the trap ratio l from the above

values of ka and kb , the coupling constants of all additional resonances due to energy level degeneracies in the case of commensurate trap frequencies are at least a factor of  2 smaller than the coupling constant of the desired resonance (23), if the trap ratio is chosen large enough according to the limits in (36) and (38).

where we have assumed the Lamb-Dicke limit to calculate the coupling V between the states (39). We will further investigate the significance of the limitations discussed here in the section below where we concentrate on the ^ (1) linear coupling Hamiltonian HI , given in (2).

As pointed out by Gardiner et. al. [25], dropping all offresonant terms in going from (18) to (23) imposes a limit on the time T for which the Hamiltonian (23) is a valid approximation. This limit can be calculated in second order perturbation theory to be T V 2 /  1, where V is the effective coupling to the nearest off-resonant transition in (18) and  is the corresponding detuning. If |M a |N b is a characteristic state which represents the highest energy state that we allow to be acted upon, the transitions |M - ka + 1 a |N |M - ka a |N

In the following we use the above formalism to tar^ (1) get the linear coupling Hamiltonian HI , given in (2) and show how this generates a rotation of the twodimensional quantum motional state of the ion. We then examine the validity of the approximations discussed in the previous section through a numerical analysis of this specific example. ^ (1) The linear coupling HI is obtained from the symmetrically combined two-mode Raman Hamiltonian (18) through the particular choice 13 = b - a , for the Raman detuning and adjusting the relative phase of the lasers such that the Raman coupling constant g13 = i|g13 |, is purely imaginary. This leads to the Hamiltonian

which, in the limits discussed in the previous section, re^ (1) sults in the linear coupling HI . The coupling constant g in (2) is then given by g = -|g(0, 0)|. The Hamilto^ (1) nian HI effects a rotation of the two-dimensional quantum motional state of the ion about the centre of the trap. This can be seen by examining the action of the ^ (1) Hamiltonian HI on the operators a and ^ Using the ^ b. Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff theorem, we have ^ ^^  ^ a = U (1) a U (1) = a cos  - ^ sin  , ^ b ^ = U (1)^ U (1) = a sin  + ^ cos  , ^ b^ ^ b b (42) ^ where the angle  = gt, and U (1) is the unitary transfor^ (1) mation generated by the Hamiltonian HI , i.e.

responds to a rotation of the rescaled coordinate system x = x/x0 , and y = y/y0 , through an angle  = gt, so that in the rotated coordinate system we have x = x cos  - y sin  , y = x sin  + y cos  . (44)

Now an arbitrary pure or mixed motional state of the ion is characterized by a density operator  which can be ^ written as = ^

where we have used (42) and |m  |n  is the number a b state basis for the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator but now in the rotated coordinates x and y as given in (44). Therefore the motional state of the ion given by (t) is identical to , but rotated through an angle ^ ^  = gt. In particular, this is accomplished without prior knowledge of the motional state . ^ Having convinced ourselves that the linear coupling ^ (1) Hamiltonian HI does rotate an arbitrary motional state of the ion we now examine the validity of the approximations discussed in the previous section for this specific example of the general coupling Hamiltonian (23). We consider a state rotation through the angle  = /2, so that Trot = /2g is the required time to rotate the state. For this case, the limitations due to off-resonant terms (section IV C) as given in eq.(40) take the form  b Nmax  , 2 |g13 | (47)

gives the unitary evolution of the initial state |0 under the action of the symmetrically combined Raman Hamiltonian (41), and the state ^ | = U (1) |0 , (51)

gives the desired evolution of the initial state under the action of the linear coupling Hamiltonian (2). This cannot be calculated analytically. To go beyond the analytics we numerically compute the unitary evolution (50), including the higher on-resonant and off-resonant terms, on the initial pure state, |0 = | a  | b , where | a and | a are coherent states in the vibrational modes a and b respectively. In this case the desired state (51), rotated through  = /2, is given by | = |- a  | b . The results of our numerical analysis are shown in Fig.5.

determines the significance of off-resonant terms in the system dynamics. From our discussion of the significance of additional on-resonant terms (section IV B) we require a trap ratio l = a /b  5, for the linear coupler where ka = kb = 1, (36). The estimates used to determine this minimal trap ratio essentially compare the coupling strengths of the different terms appearing in the Hamiltonian (41) with no reference to the actual state on which it acts. Although this method of estimation is used in the literature, it can only serve as a rough guide. A more rigorous measure ^ (1) of how the unitary time evolution Utot , generated by the symmetrically combined two-mode Raman Hamiltonian ^ (41), deviates from the desired unitary evolution U (1) , generated by the linear coupling Hamiltonian (2), can be quite complicated. A fully rigorous state independent measure of the difference between two unitary operators can be constructed [26], but we will not consider this here. In order to examine the validity of the approximations discussed in the previous section we adopt the overlap   | tot | | , (49) 9

FIG. 5. Results from our numerical analysis of the deviation of the unitary evolution generated by the symmetrically combined Raman Hamiltonian tuned for rotation from the desired state rotation. We plot the overlap  = | tot | |, between the state |tot , resulting from the Raman Hamiltonian tuned for rotation and the desired state | = | -  a  | b , resulting from a rotation of the initial state |0 = | a | b , through the angle  = /2. We have chosen  = 1. The graphs (a) ­ (d) show the dependence of the time evolution of  on the parameter  which takes on the values  = 22/2n where n = 3, .., 0 in unit steps.

There we plot the overlap  as a function of the scaled time gt, for different values of the parameter , given by (48) and a coherent state amplitude  = 1. Before we discuss our results we note the following on our

choice of parameters. In Fig.5(a) ­ (d),  takes on the values  = 22/2n, where n = 3, .., 0 in unit steps, and the Raman coupling constant g13 is kept constant. For simplicity, we assume the geometry of the laser excitation to be arranged so that the Lamb-Dicke parameters 12 = x0 k12 , and 23 = y0 k23 , are equal. Here it is important to note that the values of the Lamb-Dicke parameters 12 and 23 depend on the size of the trap frequencies a and b through x0 = (¯ /2a m)1/2 and h y0 = (¯ /2b m)1/2 . Therefore the size of the Lambh Dicke parameters depends on  and varies from Fig.5(a) to (d). To incorporate this dependency in our numer2 2 ical analysis we put 12 = 23 = 0.88, which gives 12 = 23 = 0.2, when  = 22. These are values for the Lamb-Dicke parameters and the ratio  which have been demonstrated in cold ion experiments [7­10]. Following our discussion of the trap anisotropy we choose the trap ratio l = a /b = 5. Our numerical analysis was performed in a finite (truncated) number state basis (|0 a |0 b ..|8 a |8 b ) with a cutoff chosen such that an increase of this cutoff does not significantly alter the result of our integration. Fig.5(a) shows the time evolution of the overlap  for the lowest value of . Here the offresonant terms in eq.(41) cause strong modulations in . For higher values of  these modulations become much less pronounced as the off-resonant terms contribute less on these timescales (Fig.5(b) ­ (d)). The time evolution of  for the highest value of  is shown with the solid line in Fig.5(d). The plot reaches a maximum of   0.99 at gt  1.02 × /2. It shows almost no deviation from the dashed line in Fig.5 (d) which is a numerical integration of the system dynamics where we only include the desired resonances in the Hamiltonian as in (22). The numerical analysis shows that for low system excitation the Hamil^ (1) tonian HI can be engineered with high accuracy within present ion traps. To investigate the system dynamics for higher energies becomes computationally very expensive. To achieve the same accuracy as obtained for  = 1 for higher values of , the number state basis must be greatly enlarged. In the above, we neglected decoherence. From our final comments in section III, using the experimental parameters [7] for 9 Be+ with /2 = 19MHz, g13 /2 = 500kHz, 12 /2 = 23 /2 = 12GHz and 12 = 23 = 0.2, we find Tspont  200µs. This is to be compared with the time to rotate the motional state through the angle  = /2, Trot  12µs. This confirms our initial assumption that decoherence through spontaneous emission can be neglected for this process. However, this may not be the case when engineering higher order interactions. One can

shorten the interaction time by increasing the laser power while maintaining inequality (7) by increasing the detunings 12 and 23 . The fundamental limit is then given by the detunings that one can realize and the accessible laser power.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this work we showed how one can engineer a class of Hamiltonians for the motional dynamics of an ultra-cold ion in a harmonic trap. The process uses a stimulated Raman transition in a -configuration with the two lasers propagating along the x- and y-directions. To decouple the internal electronic dynamics from the external motional dynamics we constructed a Hamiltonian in which these evolutions factored. This was done through the addition of a second pair of lasers which generated the symmetric counter-part to the Hamiltonian generated by the first pair of lasers. By preparing the electronic states in a particular superposition, the internal and external dynamics completely separated and we could treat the motional dynamics alone. In the Lamb-Dicke limit and with suitable sideband detunings, we could "target" a particular term to be of leading order in the Hamiltonian. However, we found that besides the term we wanted to dominate, other, higher on-resonant terms appeared. We could manipulate the strengths of the couplings to these unwanted terms by altering the trap frequency ratio and found that we could neglect these unwanted terms in the Lamb-Dicke approximation for large enough trap anisotropies. Finally, we did a numerical evaluation of the full Hamiltonian as a check on the analytical estimates. Although we have primarily concentrated on the linear rotation Hamiltonian (2), higher order dynamics ^ (3) can be generated i.e. HI , given by eq.(3). The nonlinear ^ (3) Hamiltonian HI , has been much studied in the quantum optical literature as a model of nonlinearly-coupled field modes [21]. We know from this work that such Hamiltonians generate a rich nonlinear dynamical structure reflecting the strong mode entanglement characteristic of those couplings. Their optical realization is difficult, but may well be more straightforward in trapped ion dynamics, as resonances can then be used to isolate chosen nonlinearities. Finally, we note the recent publication of two papers [27] which examine types of non-linear interaction Hamiltonians in the motion of trapped ions which are closely related to the work presented here.

We study wave packet dynamics of a Bose condensate in a periodically shaken trap. Dichotomy, that is, dynamic splitting of the condensate, and dynamic stabilization are analyzed in analogy with similar phenomena in the domain of atoms in strong laser fields. 03.75.Fi,32.80.RM,05.30.Jp

Recently it has become possible to prepare BoseEinstein condensates of alkali gases [1] with up to 107 magnetically trapped atoms. The condensed state is a macroscopically populated quantum state well localized in the magnetic trap. It is, therefore, an ideal tool to study wave packet dynamics under experimentally feasible conditions. There are many interesting quantum phenomena resulting from the electronic wave packet dynamics; in this Letter we refer, in particular, to the phenomena of wave packet dichotomy and stabilization exhibited by an electron bound by an atomic potential in presence of a strong laser field [2]. We argue that the same phenomena occur in the dynamics of the condensate wave function. The analogy is based on the fact that in the frame of reference moving with the free electron oscillating in the field, the Kramers-Henneberger frame, the effect of the laser is equivalent to a periodic shaking of the atomic potential along the laser polarization axis. A condensate in a periodically shaken trap could, therefore, a priori show a similar behavior. As the intense laser field drives the electron, the process of ionization of the atom occurs. By increasing the laser intensity, one normally increases the ionization rate. However, for very intense fields of high frequency, this rate eventually starts to decrease with intensity ­ this is called atomic stabilization [2]. In this process the electronic wave packet remains bounded, i.e. well localized in space (without spreading), although highly distorted due to the combined effects of the laser field and the atomic potential . This effective atom-laser potential exhibits a double well structure which splits the electronic wave packet into two spatially separate parts; this effect is called dichotomy. To achieve stabilization it is necessary to turn on the laser adiabatically in order to ensure that the atomic ground state will evolve to the ground 1

state of this effective atom-laser potential. This type of stabilization [3] has never been observed experimentally [4], since it requires very intense high frequency fields, which currently can only be generated in a form of a very short pulse; as an electron in an atom is highly unstable, it would thus be most likely ionized during the turn-on of such a pulse. Let us analyze the analogy between the electron and the condensate in more detail. The electron bound by an atomic potential U (r) and interacting with a laser field of amplitude Eez (polarized along the z-direction) is, for our purposes, best described in the Kramers-Henneberger frame of reference, in which the interaction with the laser field results in an effective time dependent "atomic" potential: -i¯ t - h h ¯ 2 2 + Ue (r + L sin(L t)ez ) e (r, t) = 0, (1) 2me

2 where L = (eE)/(me L ) is the electron excursion amplitude, while L is the laser frequency. Consider now a condensate with N atoms in a magnetic trap V (r) which is periodically shaken along the z-axis. In a Hartree-Fock treatment, the state of the condensate is described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) [5]. It accurately describes the wave function of the condensate  in presence of particle interactions in thermal equilibrium at temperatures well below the critical temperature. Furthermore, the time dependent GPE describes the dynamics of the condensate in more general time dependent conditions [5­7]. We, therefore, have:

-i¯ t - h

h ¯ 2 2 + V (r + (t)ez ) + gN |(r, t)|2 (r, t) = 0. 2m (2)

Here (t) = 0 sin(t) is the shaking amplitude. If we identify the amplitude 0 and the frequency  of the shaking with the electron excursion amplitude L and the laser frequency L respectively, Eq.(2) is very similar to Eq.(1). An important difference is the presence of a nonlinear coupling term with a coupling constant g = 4¯ 2 as /m, where as > 0 is the s-wave scattering length. h The effects due to the presence of the nonlinear term

as well as the larger mass of the atom will be discussed below. We model the trapping potential by V (r) = m(2 x2 + 2 y 2 + 2 z 2 )/2, x y z (3)

The initial state of the condensate for temperature T  0 is given by the lowest eigenstate 0 of the time independent GPE [-µ - h ¯ 2 2 + V (r) + N g|0 (r)|2 ]0 (r) = 0. 2m (6)

for V (r) < Vc , and V (r) = Vc otherwise. This is a harmonic potential with frequencies x,y,z which is cut at an energy Vc . It thus resembles Ue (r), in particular we have that V (r  ) like Ue (r  ) is constant. This trapping potential can be realized as an effective (adiabatic) trap potential "dressed" by the microwave coupling between a trapped and an untrapped state. We will discuss this model later on in the paper. Another possible realization would be a condensate in a dipole trap potential formed by a strong off-resonant laser field. The condensation might take place in such a trap, or the magnetically trapped condensate may be loaded into it. Note that in absence of the cut Vc , i.e. for an exactly harmonic potential the shaking of the trap would lead to an undistorted oscillation of the condensate wave function. If the time scale 1/L in Eq.(1) is shorter than the typical time scale of the electronic motion, the combined laser-atom potential can be replaced by its time average over one laser period; ideally the wave function of the electron will then evolve adiabatically from a state in the bare atomic potential into the corresponding state of this time-averaged atom-laser potential [2]. For a large enough amplitude L , this time average potential will have a double well structure and thus the electron wave function will exhibit dichotomy. Using the same reasoning for the condensate we replace the GPE (Eq.(2)) by a GPE with a time-averaged potential if the time scale  1/ of the shaking is shorter than all other relevant time scales: -i¯ t - h h ¯ 2 2 + Veff (r, 0 ) + gN |(r, t)|2 (r, t) = 0, 2m (4) where the time-averaged potential is given by Veff (r, 0 ) = 1 2


where µ is the chemical potential. By replacing V by Veff in Eq.(6) we determine the ground state of the system in presence of the double well potential. The corresponding chemical potential is µeff .

For sufficiently large shaking amplitudes, a double well structure appears as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). We therefore expect dichotomy as well as stabilization to appear also, due to the trapping of the atomic wave function in the two potential wells of Veff near the turning points of the oscillation. Indeed, for large enough 0 , stable states are dynamically formed in the double well. Even though the particles in such states are sometimes out of the trap, no "ionization" occurs. This is due to the fact that the time scale for particle motion is much larger than the time scale 1/ of shaking, so that the particles do not have enough time to react on being momentarily out of the trap. Due to the large atomic mass, the requirements on  are in fact much less stringent than in the electronic case. 2

In contrast to Eq.(1), the GPE accounts for atomic interactions, so that the condensate splitting depends on gN . With increasing N the wave function will at some point overcome the potential barrier between the wells in Veff , and the splitting will disappear. This will happen when the effective chemical potential (µeff ) in the double well potential Veff exceeds the height of the double well. Therefore the number N is limited from above. The validity of the above picture depends on the turnon time of the shaking. Ideally, an adiabatic switching will transfer the ground state of the GPE (Eq.(6)) at t = 0 to the ground state of the GPE with V replaced Veff . Too rapid passage from the cut-harmonic potential into the double well form induces transitions to the higher states of Veff and even into the continuum. To avoid these transitions, we turn on the shaking gradually, setting

The turn-on time ton must be  2/; in practice we take ton  (50 - 150) × 2/  20 /az , where az = ¯ /2mz . h A typical experimental sequence to demonstrate the above phenomena will consist in the following. Initially, the system is prepared in the state 0 of Eq.(6). At time t = 0 we slowly start shaking the trap along the zaxis (Eq.(7)). Let us first assume that the perpendicular motion does not play a significant role, and consider the motion along the z-axis only. In Fig. 2(a) we show the the time evolution of the 1D-condensate wave function. The parameters used are the same as for Fig. 1(a), i.e.  = 10z , Vc = 80¯ z , 0 = 30az , and gN = 100. h The gradual splitting of the condensate wave function can be clearly seen. Moreover almost all particles remain trapped. Due to the cut Vc in the trapping potential (Eq.(3)) atoms may escape from the trap. However, as can bee seen from Fig. 2(a), almost no atoms do it; this indicates stabilization. To study this phenomenon in more detail we lower the cut-off energy Vc to 50¯ z to favor h the escape from the trap. The escape rate is calculated using standard absorbing boundary conditions [2](b); we observe a decrease in the escape rate if the shaking amplitude 0 , increases. More specifically, increasing 0 from 15az to 20az , the escape rate decreases by a factor  2. Due to the large atomic mass the escape rate is overall very small, i.e.  1% of the trapped population per 100 shaking cycles. For the same reason, the condensate stabilization occurs already for relatively small shaking frequencies ¯  < Vc - µeff . The condensate stabilization h is, therefore, more pronounced and can be achieved in experimentally more accessible conditions than its analog in strong field dynamics of electrons.

We turn now to a discussion of a model with two internal states, a trapped state (F, mF = 0) and an untrapped state (F  , mF = 0) . They are coupled via a microwave field which allows coherent transitions between the states [8]. In the rotating wave approximation the GPE is given by -i¯ t - h + h ¯ 2 2 + gN (|0 (r, t)|2 + |1 (r, t)|2 ) 2m 0 (r, t 1 (r, t) = 0. (8)

The potential V- resembles our model potential; this is illustrated in Fig. 1(b) in which we also plot time averages of the time dependent dressed state potential. Obviously Eq.(2), with V replaced by V- , is not exact, since it neglects entirely the non-adiabatic transitions to an upper branch of the dressed potential. The model is nevertheless reasonable, since the exact numerical treatment based of the two­component GPE leads to very 3

similar results, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In the model of Eq.(8) we account rigorously for non-adiabatic (LandauZener) transitions from the lower to the upper "dressed" state manifold. Obviously, some of the atoms may cease to oscillate in the lower potential and instead they may be transferred to the upper "dressed" potential, destroying the dichotomy. In order to avoid the Landau-Zener transitions  has to be smaller than a certain critical value [9]. On the other hand for the validity of the timeaveraged potential  has a lower limit of approximately 2z . In consequence dichotomy and stabilization in a realistic system occur in a limited range of 's. Finally, we have generalized our study to a 3D case. We chose parameters that resemble those of the MIT experiment [1], that is a cigar shaped trap with a small z and equal frequencies perpendicular to it. We assume the shaking occurs along the long z-axis. As shown in Fig. 3 the presence of perpendicular motion does not invalidate the conclusions from the 1D approximation: the splitting of the condensate is clearly visible.

esting possibilities of condensate state engineering. For instance, so far double peaked condensates have been created using laser "knives" that cut a single condensate into two parts. We offer here an alternative method to achieve a similar dichotomy in a more controlled way which opens new perspectives for condensate interference studies. K.-A. S. and A.

One should mention that the completeness of our analysis requires to check the stability of the solutions of the time dependent GPE. Unstable solutions might lead to a depletion of the condensate [10]. In a first attempt we verified that the solutions of an oscillating condensate in a harmonic trap lead to stable solutions of the GPE, and therefore to no depletion. Summarizing, we have shown that Bose-Einstein condensates are ideal tools to study wave packet behavior first predicted in the realm of atoms in superstrong laser fields. We have shown that both, dichotomy and stabilization against atom escape can be achieved in condenstates. Although these effects are very difficult to realize in electron-atom systems, their observation in condensates seems quite feasible. Furthermore, we believe that wave packet dynamics of condensates might lead to inter-

Abstract
We construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by the classical action-angle variables with the following properties. i) The time evolution is exactly given by classical evolution of the angle variables. (The angle variable corresponding to the position on the orbit is now non-compact and we do not get exactly the same state after one period. However the gross features do not change. In particular expectation values remain peaked around the labels.) ii) Resolution of identity using this overcomplete set involves exactly the classical phase space measure. iii) Semi-classical limit is related to BohrSommerfield quantization. iv) They are almost minimum uncertainty wave packets in position and momentum.

I. INTRODUCTION

Schrodinger [1] attempted to construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom which were related to classical orbits. Such a construction was easy for the harmonic oscillator and these are the well known coherent states [2] [3]. Hydrogen atom however proved to be more difficult and the question was not resolved at that time. The issue has become relevant again in connection with the Rydberg atoms [4] in microwave cavities. Various considerations have led to different proposals [5] for the coherent states of the hydrogen atom. Some used the dynamical groups SO(4) or SO(4,2). But the class of states did not go into each other under time evolution. Klauder [6] has constructed coherent states with the property that under time evolution these remain coherent states. Recently one of us [7] constructed a set of coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator which was unique when precise connection to the classical phase space and dynamics was demanded. We construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by classical phase space variables.

The angle variable  now has the range (-, ). Note that only the bound state spectrum has been used. Wave packets built out of scattering states with similar properties can also be constructed by our techniques, but will not be considered here.

The wave packets peak around the point in the classical phase space represented by the labels. The expectation values of position and momenta do not exactly correspond to the labels and the wave packets are not of minimal uncertainty, in contrast to the harmonic oscillator coherent states. But these features of the latter are present in the semi-classical limit. 2

II. CORRESPONDENCE TO THE KEPLER PROBLEM

The bound state Kepler problem is conveniently described [8] by three action variables M, L, R and their corresponding angle variables 1 , 2 , 3 . (These are related to the variables in ref [8] through J3 = R, J2 = 2L, J3 = 2M, i = 2wi, i = 1, 2, 3.) The hamiltonian H involves only R. H=- 2 2 me4 R2 (5)

L is the magnitude of the total angular momentum, and M is the z component of the angular momentum. The angle variables 1 and 2 are also constants of motion in this problem because their corresponding frequencies are zero. Only 3 changes in time as 3 (t) = 2 (R)t T with 1 4 2 me4 = T (R) R3 (6)

where T(R) is the time period of the orbit. It has been observed in [6] [7] that the time evolution in equation (4) is possible only if the angle variable 3 is extended to the covering space; 3  (-, ). This is because the energy levels are incommensurate. After one period the wave packet is not reproduced, though grossly it has the same features. This uniquely fixes the dependence on 3 . |R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 =

(R, L and 3 do not change under rotation of axes.) 1 is the angle between the y axis and the line of nodes. (i.e. the line of intersection between the orbital plane and the x-y plane.) 2 is the angle between the line of nodes and the major axis (fig 1). Also M = cos 4 where 4 is the inclination of the orbit. (i.e. the L angle between the normal n to the orbit and the z axis.) Thus under rotation of the orbit around the z axis (by angle 1 ), 1 increases by 1 while 2 and 4 do not change. This ^ ^ uniquely requires the dependence on 1 to involve exp(-i1 Jz ) where Jz is the generator of rotations about the z axis. A rotation about the line of nodes by an angle 4 increases 4 by 4 while keeping 1 and 2 unchanged. This fixes the dependence on 4 and 1 to involve ^ ^ exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i 4 Jy ). This is because the rotation about line of nodes corresponds ^ ^ ^ to exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i4 Jy )exp(1 Jz ). Finally a rotation about the normal n by angle 4 increases 2 by 4 while keeping the other two angles constant. This rotation corresponds to ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ exp(-i1 Jz ) exp(-i 4 Jy ) exp(-i2 Jz ) exp(i 4 Jy ) exp(i1 Jz ). Therefore the dependence on 4 , 1 , 2 is required to be 3

^ ^ ^ exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i 4 Jy )exp(-i2 Jz ). Note that this rotation precisely corresponds to taking an orbit in the x-y plane with the major axis along the x direction into the orbit labelled by (R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3). We may exploit the dynamical O(4) symmetry of the hydrogen atom to fix the dependence on L also. In addition to the conserved vector J related to rotational invariance, we have another conserved vector K along the major axis (fig 2.) related to the Laplace Runge Lenz vector. We have (J + K)2 = (J - K)2 = R2 , J2 = L2 and the eccentricity of the L2 orbit is e = 1 - R2 . The role of the vector K is to deform the orbits by changing L. The O(4) symmetry corresponds to independent rotations of the vectors J+K and J-K in the 2 2 3-dimensional space. Consider a circular orbit in the x-y plane. Now K = 0 and J ± K are in the z direction. Imagine a rotation of J+K about the 2-axis by an angle 5 and an equal and opposite rotation 2 of J-K . This will give a non zero K of magnitude R sin 5 along the x direction and J of 2 magnitude R cos 5 along the z direction. Thus the orbit has been deformed into an elliptic L orbit in the x-y plane with R = cos 5 . The above analysis shows the following. In order to have the right transformation properties of the classical variables R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 under the full O(4) symmetry, the dependence on R, L, 1 , 2 has to be via e-i1 Jz e-i4 Jy e-i2 Jz e-i5

L where cos 5 = R and cos 4 = M . Classically this will rotate and deform a circular orbit in L the x-y plane into the orbit with the labels (R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 ) (without changing the size of the major axis). Quantum mechanically the former corresponds to the state |n, n - 1, n - 1 . Therefore we may expect the coherent state to have the form

With a proper choice of Cn (R) this will have the properties we require. However we find that it is much more natural and convenient to use a different set of action angle variables. Note the close relation to the angular momentum coherent states. Note also that the angle variables 1 , 2 are involved in rotation about the third axis whereas the angles 4 and 5 related to the action variables are involved in rotation about the one and two axes. This is a general feature as seen below.
III. COHERENT STATES FOR A PRECESSING SPIN

Consider a spinning object with spin quantum number j and gyromagnetic ratio µ in ^ ^ an external magnetic field B in the z direction. The hamiltonian is H = µB Jz . Classically the spin will precess about the z axis with frequency µB. The action variable is Jz which measures the inclination to the z axis and the angle variable   (0, 2), is the azimuthal angle of the precessing spin. We now show that by requiring classical time evolution, semiclassical limit and correct rotation property for the states |Jz ,  labelled by the classical 4

phase space of this system, we obtain uniquely the angular momentum coherent states [9] . We have |Jz ,  =

to reproduce the classical evolution, |Jz ,  - |Jz ,  + µBt . Under rotation by angle  about the x axis,  goes to  + where cos  = Jz and J is the classical spin to be associated J to the spin quantum number j. In order that |Jz ,  have this property, we have to choose |Jz ,  = e-iJz e-iJy |jj
^ ^

(11)

This is precisely the rotation that takes the z axis to the instantaneous axis of the classical spin. Correct semi-classical limit requires the choice |jj as seen below. Note that we have precisely got the angular momentum coherent state labelled by  and . We now show that this has the right semi classical limit and resolution of identity |Jz ,  =

For large j, djjm () peaks at cos  = m i.e. the dominant contributions come from the states j m¯  Jz . h As Jz and  are action angle variables, the phase space measure is dJz d. Now 1 h

with the identification J = (j + 1/2)¯ . (This means that we must associate classical J = h (j + 1/2)¯ to the spin quantum number j.) h Thus the angles  and  appearing in the angular momentum coherent state equation no.(12) can be interpreted as classical phase space variables for a precessing spin with  as the angle variable and (j + 1/2)cos  as the corresponding action variable.

In place of the conserved variables L, M, 1 , 2 we will use other variables suggested by ^ ^ the O(4) symmetry. We will use the two O(3)'s in O(4) generated by ( J±K ). We define 2 |R, , , , ,  =

The new angles are related to the earlier angles as follows (ref fig.2). The J+K rotation 2 rotates the classical vector J + K from the z axis to (R sin  cos , R sin  sin , R cos ) ^ ^ ^ ^ without affecting J-K . Similarly the J-K rotation rotates the classical vector J - K from 2 2 z axis to (R sin  cos , R sin  sin , R cos ). Therefore the projection of J on the z axis R gives cos 4 = |J| (cos  + cos ) where |J| = R 2 + 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) + 2 cos  cos . ^ The line of nodes is along z × J and therefore has the direction cosines (sin  sin  + ^ 1 sin  sin , -sin  cos  - sin  cos ). Therefore cos  = |ON| (sin  sin  + sin  sin ) with |ON| = R sin2  + sin2  + 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) .  is obtained by taking the compo1 nent of K along the line of nodes and therefore cos  = |ON||K| (sin2  cos 2 - sin2  cos 2) and |K| = R 2 - 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) - 2 cos  cos . The orbit is simply obtained from the vectors J+K and J-K because it is perpendicular to J and has the major axis along R the direction K with magnitude ( 2h )2 a where a is the Bohr radius. Also the eccentricity is J2 given by e = 1 - (J±K)2 . The classical phase space measure in the new variables is dR d d((j + 1/2)¯ cos ) d d((j + 1/2)¯ cos ) d h h For large J, the state |R, , , , ,  gets dominant contribution from m1 = (j + 1/2) cos  and m2 = (j + 1/2) cos . This is exactly as wanted by Bohr quantization of the action angle pairs because cos  = (J+K)z and cos  = (J-K)z . Therefore we only have to fix Cj (R) by R R requiring the correct semi-classical limit and resolution of identity. We want Cj (R) to peak at R = (2j + 1)¯ as Bohr quantization gives R = n¯ . Also to get a resolution of identity we h h require 1 h ¯

Thus we get the coherent state as in equation no.(1).
V. WAVE PACKET PROPERTIES

In case of the harmonic oscillator coherent states |z the expectation values of the position and momentum operators are directly given by the real and imaginary parts of the label 6

z. Also they are minimal uncertainty states. For our coherent states, these properties are not valid exactly, but are valid asymptotically in the semi-classical region [7]. This is a consequence of the semi-classical limit of our coherent states where the correspondence ^ ^ principle may be applied. Consider the expectation value of an operator O(p, q) in a coherent state. For large values of R, L, and M (in units of h), the coherent state is dominated by ¯ the states |nlm with n  R/¯ , l  L/¯ and m  M/¯ . Now, the correspondence principle h h h ^ to the value of the corresponding classical variable O(p, q) relates the expectation value of O for the corresponding classical orbit. Thus asymptotically, our coherent states are wave packets peaked around position, momenta etc. corresponding to the action angle variables labelling it. Also, asymptotically they would be minimum uncertainty states. More detailed consideration of these properties for small values of the action variables will be considered elsewhere.
VI. CONCLUSION

We have constructed wave packets for the hydrogen atom, labelled by points of the classical phase space which follow classical orbits very closely. They have the correct semiclassical limit corresponding to Bohr quantization. In addition, they have the desirable property that the resolution of identity involves exactly the classical phase space measure. As a consequence of incommensurate energy levels, our wave packets do not return to the original state after one period, but the overall features do not change. One may interpret this as follows : the wave packet has (an infinite number of) internal degrees of freedom, which may not return to the original state after a period.

Abstract
We construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by the classical action-angle variables with the following properties. i) The time evolution is exactly given by classical evolution of the angle variables. (The angle variable corresponding to the position on the orbit is now non-compact and we do not get exactly the same state after one period. However the gross features do not change. In particular the wave packet remains peaked around the labels.) ii) Resolution of identity using this overcomplete set involves exactly the classical phase space measure. iii) Semi-classical limit is related to BohrSommerfield quantization. iv) They are almost minimum uncertainty wave packets in position and momentum.

I. INTRODUCTION

Schrodinger [1] attempted to construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom that were related to classical orbits. Such a construction was easy for the harmonic oscillator, and these are the well known coherent states [2] [3]. The hydrogen atom, however, proved to be more difficult and the question was not resolved at that time. The issue has become relevant again in connection with the Rydberg atoms [4] in microwave cavities. Various considerations have led to different proposals [5] for the coherent states of the hydrogen atom. Some used the dynamical groups SO(4) or SO(4,2). However, a state of the class did not go into a state of the same class under time evolution. Klauder [6] has constructed coherent states with the property that under time evolution these remain coherent states. Recently one of us [7] constructed a set of coherent states for the anharmonic oscillator which was unique when precise connection to the classical phase space and dynamics was demanded. We construct wave packets for the hydrogen atom labelled by classical phase space variables.

The definition of these variables and their relation to the classical orbit is explained later. The angle variable  now has the range (-, ). Note that only the bound state spectrum has been used. Wave packets built out of scattering states with similar properties can also be constructed using our techniques, but will not be considered here.

The wave packets peak around the point in the classical phase space represented by the labels. The expectation values of position and momenta do not exactly correspond to the 2

labels and the wave packets are not of minimal uncertainty, in contrast to the harmonic oscillator coherent states. But these features of the latter are present in the semi-classical limit.
II. CORRESPONDENCE TO THE KEPLER PROBLEM

The bound state Kepler problem is conveniently described [8] by three action variables M, L, R and their corresponding angle variables 1 , 2 , 3 . (These are related to the variables in Ref [8] through J3 = R, J2 = 2L, J3 = 2M, i = 2wi, i = 1, 2, 3.) The hamiltonian H involves only R. H=- 2 2 me4 R2 (5)

L is the magnitude of the total angular momentum, and M is the z component of the angular momentum. The angle variables 1 and 2 are also constants of motion in this problem because their corresponding frequencies are zero. Only 3 changes in time as 2 3 (t) = t T (R) with 1 4 2 me4 = T (R) R3 (6)

where T(R) is the time period of the orbit. It has been observed in [6] [7] that the time evolution in equation (4) is possible only if the angle variable 3 is extended to the covering space; 3  (-, ). This is because the energy levels are incommensurate. After one period the wave packet is not reproduced, though grossly it has the same features. This uniquely fixes the dependence on 3 . |R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 =

Under rotation we require these wave packets to go into one another as these labels do. |R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 - |R, L, M(R), 1 (R), 2 (R), 3

(R, L and 3 do not change under rotation of axes.) 1 is the angle between the y axis and the line of nodes. (i.e. the line of intersection between the orbital plane and the x-y plane.) 2 is the angle between the line of nodes and the major axis (fig 1). Also M = cos 4 , where 4 is the inclination of the orbit. (i.e. the L angle between the normal n to the orbit and the z axis.) Thus under rotation of the orbit around the z axis (by angle 1 ), 1 increases by 1 while 2 and 4 do not change. This ^ ^ uniquely requires the dependence on 1 to involve exp(-i1 Jz ) where Jz is the generator of rotations about the z axis. A rotation about the line of nodes by an angle 4 increases 4 by 4 while keeping 1 and 2 unchanged. This fixes the dependence on 4 and 1 so ^ ^ that it involves exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i 4 Jy ). This is because the rotation about line of nodes ^ ^ ^ corresponds to exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i4 Jy )exp(1 Jz ). Finally a rotation about the normal n by angle 4 increases 2 by 4 while keeping the other two angles constant. This rotation corresponds to 3

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ exp(-i1 Jz ) exp(-i 4 Jy ) exp(-i2 Jz ) exp(i 4 Jy ) exp(i1 Jz ). Therefore the dependence on 4 , 1 , 2 is required to be ^ ^ ^ exp(-i1 Jz )exp(-i 4 Jy )exp(-i2 Jz ). Note that this rotation precisely corresponds to taking an orbit in the x-y plane with the major axis along the x direction into the orbit labelled by (R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3). We may exploit the dynamical O(4) symmetry of the hydrogen atom to fix the dependence on L also. In addition to the conserved vector J related to rotational invariance, we have another conserved vector K along the major axis (fig 2.) related to the Laplace Runge Lenz vector. We have (J + K)2 = (J - K)2 = R2 , J2 = L2 and the eccentricity of the L2 orbit is e = 1 - R2 . The role of the vector K is to deform the orbits by changing L. The O(4) symmetry corresponds to independent rotations of the vectors J+K and J-K in the 2 2 3-dimensional space. Consider a circular orbit in the x-y plane. Now K = 0 and J ± K are in the z direction. Imagine a rotation of J+K about the 2-axis by an angle 5 and an equal and opposite rotation 2 of J-K . This will give a non zero K of magnitude R sin 5 along the x direction and J of 2 magnitude R cos 5 along the z direction. Thus the orbit has been deformed into an elliptic L orbit in the x-y plane with R = cos 5 . The above analysis shows the following. In order to have the right transformation properties of the classical variables R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 under the full O(4) symmetry, the dependence on R, L, 1 , 2 has to be via e-i1 Jz e-i4 Jy e-i2 Jz e-i5

L where cos 5 = R and cos 4 = M . Classically this will rotate and deform a circular orbit in L the x-y plane into the orbit with the labels (R, L, M, 1 , 2 , 3 ) (without changing the size of the major axis). Quantum mechanically the former corresponds to the state |n, n - 1, n - 1 . Therefore we may expect the coherent state to have the form

With a proper choice of Cn (R) this will have the properties we require. However we find that it is much more natural and convenient to use a different set of action angle variables. Note the close relation to the angular momentum coherent states. Note also that the angle variables 1 , 2 are involved in rotation about the third axis whereas the angles 4 and 5 related to the action variables are involved in rotation about the one and two axes. This is a general feature as seen below.
III. COHERENT STATES FOR A PRECESSING SPIN

Consider a spinning object with spin quantum number j and gyromagnetic ratio µ in ^ ^ an external magnetic field B in the z direction. The hamiltonian is H = µB Jz . Classically 4

the spin will precess about the z axis with frequency µB. The action variable is Jz which measures the inclination to the z axis and the angle variable   (0, 2), is the azimuthal angle of the precessing spin. We now show that, by requiring classical time evolution, semiclassical limit and correct rotation property for the states |Jz ,  labelled by the classical phase space of this system, we obtain uniquely the angular momentum coherent states [9] . We have |Jz ,  =
m h ¯ Cm (Jz )e- h µBm¯ µB |j, m
i 

(10)

to reproduce the classical evolution, |Jz ,  - |Jz ,  + µBt . Under rotation by angle  about the x axis,  goes to  + where cos  = Jz and J is the classical spin to be associated J to the spin quantum number j. In order that |Jz ,  have this property, we have to choose |Jz ,  = e-iJz e-iJy |jj
^ ^

t

(11)

This is precisely the rotation that takes the z axis to the instantaneous axis of the classical spin. Correct semi-classical limit requires the choice |jj as seen below. Note that we have precisely got the angular momentum coherent state labelled by  and . We now show that this has the right semi classical limit and resolution of identity |Jz ,  =
m

djjm ()e-im |jm

(12)

where djjm () =   (2j)! sin( )j-m cos( )j+m (j + m)!(j - m)! 2 2 (13)

For large j, djjm () peaks at cos  = m i.e. the dominant contributions come from the states j m¯  Jz . h As Jz and  are action angle variables, the phase space measure is dJz d. Now 1 h

with the identification J = (j + 1/2)¯ . (This means that we must associate classical J = h (j + 1/2)¯ to the spin quantum number j.) h Thus the angles  and  appearing in the angular momentum coherent state Eq. (12) can be interpreted as classical phase space variables for a precessing spin with  as the angle variable and (j + 1/2)cos  as the corresponding action variable.

IV. COHERENT STATES FOR THE HYDROGEN ATOM

In place of the conserved variables L, M, 1 , 2 we will use other variables suggested by ^ ^ the O(4) symmetry. We will use the two O(3) subgroups in O(4) generated by ( J±K ). We 2 define |R, , , , ,  =

In place of quantum states |n, l, m we are now using |jm1 |jm2 of J+K and J-K re2 2 ^ ^ ^ ^ spectively. (The j quantum number is the same because (J + K)2 = (J - K)2 ). j takes half integer values 0, 1 , 1, 3 ... We get the states |nlm by going to the coupled basis 2 2 |jm1 |jm2 =
lm lm Cjm1 jm2 |2j + 1, l, m . ^ ^

(18)

The new angles are related to the earlier angles as follows (ref fig.2). The J+K rotation 2 rotates the classical vector J + K from the z axis to (R sin  cos , R sin  sin , R cos ) ^ ^ ^ ^ without affecting J-K . Similarly the J-K rotation rotates the classical vector J - K from 2 2 z axis to (R sin  cos , R sin  sin , R cos ). Therefore the projection of J on the z axis R gives cos 4 = |J| (cos  + cos ) where |J| = R 2 + 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) + 2 cos  cos . ^ The line of nodes is along z × J and therefore has the direction cosines (sin  sin  + ^ 1 sin  sin , -sin  cos  - sin  cos ). Therefore cos  = |ON| (sin  sin  + sin  sin ) with |ON| = R sin2  + sin2  + 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) .  is obtained by taking the compo1 nent of K along the line of nodes and therefore cos  = |ON||K| (sin2  cos 2 - sin2  cos 2) and |K| = R 2 - 2 sin  sin  cos( - ) - 2 cos  cos . The orbit is simply obtained from the vectors J+K and J-K because it is perpendicular to J and has the major axis along R the direction K with magnitude ( 2h )2 a where a is the Bohr radius. Also the eccentricity is J2 given by e = 1 - (J±K)2 . The classical phase space measure in the new variables is dR d d((j + 1/2)¯ cos ) d d((j + 1/2)¯ cos ) d h h For large J, the state |R, , , , ,  gets dominant contribution from m1 = (j + 1/2) cos  and m2 = (j + 1/2) cos . This is exactly as wanted by Bohr quantization of the action angle pairs because cos  = (J+K)z and cos  = (J-K)z . Therefore we only have to fix Cj (R) by R R requiring the correct semi-classical limit and resolution of identity. We want Cj (R) to peak at R = (2j + 1)¯ as Bohr quantization gives R = n¯ . Also to get a resolution of identity we h h require 1 h ¯

dR |Cj (R)|2 = 1

for all j. For normalization we require requirements are met by

Thus we get the coherent state as in equation no.(1).
V. WAVE PACKET PROPERTIES

In case of the harmonic oscillator coherent states |z the expectation values of the position and momentum operators are directly given by the real and imaginary parts of the label z. Also they are minimal uncertainty states. For our coherent states, these properties are not valid exactly, but are valid asymptotically in the semi-classical region [7]. This is a consequence of the semi-classical limit of our coherent states where the correspondence ^ ^ principle may be applied. Consider the expectation value of an operator O(p, q) in a coherent state. For large values of R, L, and M (in units of h), the coherent state is dominated by ¯ the states |nlm with n  R/¯ , l  L/¯ and m  M/¯ . Now, the correspondence principle h h h ^ to the value of the corresponding classical variable O(p, q) relates the expectation value of O for the corresponding classical orbit. Thus asymptotically, our coherent states are wave packets peaked around position, momenta etc. corresponding to the action angle variables labelling it. Also, asymptotically they would be minimum uncertainty states. More detailed consideration of these properties for small values of the action variables will be considered elsewhere.
VI. CONCLUSION

We have constructed wave packets for the hydrogen atom, labelled by points of the classical phase space which follow classical orbits very closely. They have the correct semiclassical limit corresponding to Bohr quantization. In addition, they have the desirable property that the resolution of identity involves exactly the classical phase space measure. As a consequence of incommensurate energy levels, our wave packets do not return to the original state after one period, but the overall features do not change. One may interpret this as follows : the wave packet has (an infinite number of) internal degrees of freedom, which may not return to the original state after a period.

Continuous stochastic Schr¨dinger equations and o localization

arXiv:quant-ph/9708011v1 6 Aug 1997

M. Rigo, F. Mota-Furtado and P.F. O'Mahony
Department of Mathematics, Royal Holloway, University of London, Egham, Surrey TW20 0EX, UK Abstract. The set of continuous norm-preserving stochastic Schr¨dinger equations o associated with the Lindblad master equation is introduced. This set is used to describe the localization properties of the state vector toward eigenstates of the environment operator. Particular focus is placed on determining the stochastic equation which exhibits the highest rate of localization for wide open systems. An equation having such a property is proposed in the case of a single non-hermitian environment operator. This result is relevant to numerical simulations of quantum trajectories where localization properties are used to reduce the number of basis states needed to represent the system state, and thereby increase the speed of calculation.

Introduction

A quantum system interacting with its environment can be described, in the Markovian approximation, by two complementary approaches. In the first and most commonly used [1, 2, 3], the system is represented by a density operator and its evolution is described by a master equation. In the second a state vector represents the system and a stochastic Schr¨dinger equation describes the state evolution [4, 5, 6] These two treatments are o equivalent in the following sense: for all times an ensemble of state vectors generated by a stochastic Schr¨dinger equation reproduces, on average, the density operator generated o by the master equation. The correspondence is not uniquely defined, in that for a single master equation there are many associated stochastic equations. Stochastic state vector equations, also called unravelings of the master equation, have been introduced in different contexts and with different interpretations. In the fundamental theory of quantum measurement, stochastic equations have been used to describe the general dynamical process of the state collapse into an eigenstate of the measured observable, i.e. localization [4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In quantum optics, stochastic Schr¨dinger equations have been used to describe the system state o conditioned by measurement outcomes. In this context, an unraveling corresponds to

2 a specified measurement scheme, such as photon counting, heterodyne or homodyne detection [6, 14]. More generally, in the field of open quantum systems, unravelings have been used as an efficient numerical method to solve the master equation [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. The present work is motivated by a recent study of a quantum system in interaction with a thermal bath using the quantum jump (QJ) unraveling [27]. It is shown that, under some assumptions valid in the classical limit, the QJ trajectories, i.e., the realization of the stochastic process, approach a diffusive limit very similar to the one exhibited by the quantum state diffusion (QSD) trajectories. Since diffusion is expected to be a general feature associated with the emergence of classicality, a description of the whole set of continuous unravelings becomes important. This set is introduced in a unified way in the following section. We will show that each continuous unraveling can be characterized very simply by specifying its noise correlations. The set of continuous unravelings is then used to study how quantum state properties, such as localization, evolve when the unraveling changes. A very important characteristic of quantum trajectories which has both physical and numerical consequences is the localization of quantum states toward eigenstates of the environment operator. Working with the real noise unraveling (RN), Gisin [7] has shown that for an arbitrary hermitian Lindblad operator L the state vectors concentrate on the eigenspace of L. Percival [9] extended this result by giving a proper definition of the ensemble localization of an arbitrary operator and then providing analytical bounds for the rate of self-localization of hermitian and nonhermitian Lindblad operators for the quantum state diffusion unraveling. For a dissipative interaction, Garraway and Knight [28, 29] have presented numerical simulations of the localization process using the QJ and QSD unravelings. Starting from different quantum states, such as a superposition of two coherent states, a Fock state and a squeezed ground state, they have shown that such states are highly sensitive to dissipation. They also illustrated the localization process. Recently they have applied their results to describe the evolution of a Schr¨dinger cat o state in a Kerr medium where localization competes with nonlinear effects [30] (see also [31]). For numerical simulation of open quantum systems, individual trajectories have proven advantageous over density operator computations. The main advantages stem from the fact that less space is needed to store and propagate in time a state vector than a density matrix. In addition, for trajectory methods one can exploit the localization property to reduce the number of basis states needed to represent the state vector, thus significantly reducing the time needed to calculate quantum trajectories. For quantum jump unravelings, when many Lindblad operators are present, it is well known that one can perform a unitary transformation to select one of the quantum jumps unravelings, in such a way as to minimize the number of basis states needed (see ref. [22] for an

3 application of this property). The localization of the state vector for QSD has been exploited in the mixed representation of Steimle and al. [23] and the moving basis of Schack and al. [24, 25, 26]. In section 3 we use the set of continuous unravelings to describe localization properties for a single environment operator. Several well known results are recovered for a hermitian operator [4, 32]. In the case of a non-hermitian operator the minimal rate of localization introduced for the QSD unraveling [9, 11, 12] is extended to the complete set showing that localization is a general feature shared by all the continuous unravelings, and a new unraveling is introduced. Some theoretical arguments supported by numerical simulations suggest that this new unraveling possesses the highest localization rate. In the present work we make use of the freedom of choice for the noise correlations to obtain the continuous unraveling which localizes the state vector the most. This transformation should not be confused with the unitary transformation discussed above. These two transformations are complementary and can be used together. At the end of section 3 we compare the localization properties of QSD and of our proposed unraveling. Finally, in section 4 we summarize our results and draw conclusions about the applicability of the set of continuous unravelings to the study of the quasi-classical limit of open quantum systems. 2. Continuous unravelings

We proceed following closely the derivation of the quantum state diffusion unraveling by Gisin and Percival [8]. In this work, a general stochastic differential equation with a complex Wiener process is used as a starting point. The drift and noise terms are then specified by asking that the stochastic differential equation recovers on average the Lindblad master equation for the density operator  of the system
J 1 i Lj L - {L Lj , } ,  = - [H, ] +  j h ¯ 2 j j=1

(1)

where H is the system Hamiltonian and Lj (j = 1, . . . , J) the set of Lindblad operators which represent the influence of the environment. (Since the master equation (1) is valid under a Markovian approximation, all the stochastic differential equations considered apply only within this approximation). The other conditions needed to specify the drift and noise terms are that the state remains normalized and that the stochastic equation shares the same invariance properties under unitary transformations as the master equation. This last constraint is used to prove the uniqueness of QSD among the set of continuous unravelings. Removing the constraint of invariance under unitary transformations among the Lindblad operators, we obtain the set of continuous normpreserving unravelings related to the master equation.

4 2.1. Derivation of the stochastic Schr¨dinger equations o We start by considering a general stochastic differential equation of the following It^ o form which gives the variation |d of the state vector | in a time dt

where |v and |uj are vectors, jn are complex numbers and dWjn independent real Wiener processes [33] which obey the following relationships M(dWjn ) = 0 dWjn dWkm = jk mn dt dWjn dt = 0 (3)

where M represents the ensemble average. The two conditions to be respected by the previous equation (2) are (i) the state is normalized for all times | t = 1 and (ii) for each time, the mean of the projector associated to the state | gives the density matrix  = M(| |) with the density matrix  evolving according to the master equation in Lindblad form (1). In the following, these two conditions will be used to relate the drift term |v and the stochastic term |uj to the state | as well as giving constraints on the complex numbers jn . Notice that the jn may also depend on the state | and on time t. By following closely the QSD derivation given in reference [8], we obtain the expression for the drift term 1 i |v = - H| - h ¯ 2 L Lj + L j j

where Lj  = |Lj | is the expectation value of Lj for the state | . The drift term |v is the same as that obtained in the QSD derivation, but the stochastic vectors |uj become 1 |uj = jk (Lk - Lk  )| j = 1...J (5) 2 k n |jn | which differs from the QSD derivation by the introduction of the normalization factor ( n |jn |2 )-1/2 and the set of complex numbers jk . The latter are arbitrary coefficients of a J × J unitary matrix which arises due to the freedom of choice in the linear combination of vectors (Lk - Lk  )| used to express |uj . Finally one gets the equation for the state vector increment 1 J i L Lj + L |d = - H| dt - j h ¯ 2 j=1 j

It can be seen easily that they have zero mean M(dj ) = 0 and correlations

and ci are complex numbers inside the unit circle |ci |  1 for all i = 1, . . . , J (see Appendix). Notice that although the stochastic process is completely specified by the numbers jk and in , that specification will be non-unique in that all sets of numbers that yield the same correlation coefficients cjk through equation (9) will describe the same stochastic process [33]. Thus an unraveling is completely specified when the correlation coefficients cjk are given. This result provides a natural classification for continuous stochastic Schr¨dinger equations associated with the completely positive o master equation (1). In ref [34] a similar classification is given for all (Markovian) positive master equations but only for two dimensional Hilbert spaces. This suggests that the same classification procedure can be extended to every positive master equation in arbitrary dimensions. In the absence of a unitary transformation (jk = jk ) and with only one Wiener process N = 1, the complex noises dj are necessarily of the form dj = eij dWj1 . For j = 0 we recover the real noise unraveling and for j = /2 the imaginary noise unraveling. The present work shows not only that any phase j can be chosen but also that the phase can be a smooth function of the state | and of the time. The QSD unraveling is recovered taking two Wiener processes (N = 2) with dj =  (dWj1 + idWj2 )/ 2 for all j. In this special case the correlations cjk vanish.

2.2. Unitary transformation Let us introduce the following unitary transformation among Lindblad operators Lj =
k

~ ujk Lk - j 1 1

(10)

6 where ujk and j are complex numbers and (ujk ) a unitary matrix [8, 9, 35]. With this ~ transformation the noise terms become dk = j ujk dj with the correlations ~ ~ dj dk = jk dt and ~ ~ dj dk =
J

umj unk cmn dt
m,n=1

(11)

These correlations will depend on the unitary transformation (ujk ) unless all the correlation factors vanish, i.e. cjk = 0. Since (jk ) is itself a unitary transformation, a necessary condition for invariance under unitary transformation is given by cj = 0 for all j = 1, . . . , J. (12)

When only one Wiener process N = 1 is present, the unitary invariance condition (12) implies j1 = 0 for all j. As a consequence there is no invariant unraveling with only one Wiener process. With two Wiener processes N = 2, the invariance condition becomes 2 2 j1 + j2 = 0. The norm of the two complex numbers is the same |j1 | = |j2| and the phases are related by j1 - j2 = /2 + n where n is any integer number. The simplest case n = 0 leads to dj = eij dWj1 + idWj2  2 (13)

which correspond to the complex noise used in the QSD unraveling when the phases j are set to zero. The simplest case which can satisfy the invariance condition (12) is given by the QSD unraveling. The phases j and other choices of n introduce only irrelevant phase factors which can be neglected. This is the uniqueness result of Gisin and Percival for QSD. If one considers more than two Wiener processes N  3, it is possible to construct other unravelings invariant under unitary transformation. For instance: d = dW1 + ei/3 dW2 + e-i/3 dW3  3 (14)

where we have omitted the index j and the phase factor. Since all these unravelings have the same correlations d 2 = 0 and |d|2 = dt, they are equivalent [33] and can be replaced by the QSD unraveling. 3. Localization

As an application of the set of continuous unraveling obtained in the present work, one can compute the rate of self-localization of a single environment operator L for a wide open system, i.e. H = 0, and determine the effect of the noise correlation on the rate of self-localization. The rate of self-localization is defined as the rate at which the ensemble average of the quantum mean square deviation decays [9]. It is also the

7 ensemble average rate at which the state vector | tends towards one of the (right) eigenstates of the Lindblad operator. The quantum mean square deviation of the operator L is defined as  2 (L) = L L  - L  L  . More generally the quantum covariance of two operators for the state | is (A, B) = A B  - A  B  [9]. Note that the quantum covariance of L with itself is just the quantum mean square deviation  2 (L) = (L, L). We restrict our attention to a wide open system because we want to describe the localization process, independently of the action of the Hamiltonian. This, clearly, is only a first step towards a proper understanding of localization which should involve Hamiltonian effects as well. 3.1. Hermitian environment operator For a wide open system with a hermitian environment operator L = L the state vector | evolves according to |d = -

1  L L + L  L  - 2 L  L | dt + (L - L  ) | d (15) 2 where d is a noise of the kind previously described by (7) and (8) with an associated correlation factor c given by d 2 = cdt. When the state evolves according to equation (15) we can compute the change in the expectation value of L dL


= 2 2 (L)Re(d)

(16)

and the change in the quantum mean square deviation d 2 (L) = -2 2 (L)2 (1 + Re(c)) dt + 2(L L , L)Re(d) (17)

where we have used the notation L = L - L  . The diffusion of the expectation value L  and the quantum mean square deviation is produced only by the real part of the noise term d. Taking the ensemble mean shows that the expectation value M L  = Tr(L) remains constant and the quantum mean square deviation evolves as d 2 (L) (18) = -2 (1 + Re(c)) M  2 (L)2 dt The noise correlation c is a characteristic signature of the chosen unraveling. For c = 0, the quantum state diffusion result, giving a minimal localization rate of 2, is recovered [9]. In this case, as in almost all cases, the mean square deviation tends to zero, thus the state | evolves towards one eigenstate of L. The real noise (RN) unraveling c = 1 is clearly the one which gives the highest rate of self-localization. As a consequence, for numerical simulations involving an arbitrary Hamiltonian and one hermitian environment operator, the RN unraveling should be used since it will produce M
 Note that the quantum mean square deviation is not an ensemble average.

8 the fastest localization (for continuous unravelings). In the opposite case to the RN unraveling, if one uses the imaginary noise unraveling c = -1, the mean localization rate vanishes and the state does not evolve towards an eigenstate of L. Recovering these well known results [4, 32] confirms the validity of equation (15). 3.2. Non hermitian environment operator We consider the case of a single non hermitian Lindblad operator. Since this case is more difficult to treat, we restrict ourselves to the more specific case of an annihilation  operator L = a. As for a hermitian operator, we want to determine which is the unraveling with the highest localization rate and find out if there is any unraveling which does not localize. The state vector evolves according to equation (15) and the change in the quantum mean square deviation  2 (a) = a a  - a  a  is given by d 2 (a) = -   2 (a) +  2 (a)2 + |(a , a)|2 + 2 2 (a)Re{c(a , a)} dt  + 2 Re (a a, a) - a  (a , a) - a   2 (a) d (19) which involves the quantum covariance (a , a) = a2 can also be derived to give

d(a , a) = -  (1 + 2 2 (a))(a , a) + c(a , a)2 + c  2 (a)2 dt  + 2 Re (a2 , a) - 2 a   2 (a) d

(20)

For the QSD unraveling c = 0, the two equations (19) and (20) are known to describe the localization of the state | towards a coherent state in the case of a harmonic oscillator. Furthermore, this localization is known to be globally stable [12]. Taking the ensemble mean over equation (19) removes the noise terms but introduces statistical correlations since the statistical mean of a product is in general different from the product of the statistical means. Thus one cannot obtain an immediate result for the mean rate of localization. However, one can notice that the drift part of d 2 (a) can be written as a sum of positive terms:  2 (a) + ( 2 (a) - |(a , a)|)2 + 2 2 (a)|(a , a)| 1 + Re{c (a , a) } (21) |(a , a)|

the third term of this expression being positive since |c|  1. As a consequence, the argument for global stability of coherent states, d 2 (a)  -M 2 (a), (22) dt is valid for all the continuous unravelings. A localization rate of , associated with the exponential decay of quantum correlations M 2 (a)  exp(-t), is expected to be M

9 independent of the choice of unraveling. This result shows that, for an annihilation operator, all unravelings localize and  provides a minimal bound, independent of the unraveling, for the ensemble mean localization rate. For a hermitian operator, the unraveling which localizes the most was easy to find since the evolution of the quantum mean square deviation is not coupled to any other moment. Furthermore the correlation factor c factorises, making the unraveling independent of the state. In the present case the situation is more complex, since none of these two simplifying conditions are satisfied. In the case of an annihilation operator, we adopt the following technique. Instead of considering the localization of an arbitrary state | , we restrict our attention to squeezed states. We will show that every  unraveling (15) with L = a preserves the set of squeezed states, i.e., if the initial state is a squeezed state it will evolve into a squeezed state. This has been shown for the QSD unraveling in ref. [12]. The unraveling which reduces the squeezing most efficiently is determined. Finally, some arguments will be given as to why this unraveling should be the one with the highest localization rate for an arbitrary initial state. Squeezed states are defined as the states |t , t which satisfy the relation (a - t a - t )|t , t = 0 (23) where t and t are complex numbers which label the squeezed state |t , t [36]. When the squeezing parameter t vanishes, squeezed states reduce to coherent states. Amongst the properties of squeezed states, we will use for our present purposes only the relations between the mean square deviation and the squeezing parameter
2 s (a) =

where the index s specifies that the mean square deviation is taken with respect to the squeezed state |t, t . This last relation tells us that the mean square deviation depends only on the squeezing parameter. A condition to check if squeezed states are preserved can be obtained by differentiating (23) [11, 35]. In order to simplify the calculation, the Stratonovich formalism is used. In this formalism, the usual differentiation rules apply. Thus from (23), a state | initially squeezed will remain squeezed if it is possible to write (a - t a - t )|d = (dt a + dt )| (25) where |d is to be expressed in Stratonovich form. From equation (15) and using the o usual conversion formula X  dY = XdY + 1 dXdY between the Stratonovich and It^ 2 formalism [37], one can express the differential increment for the state vector | as 1  L L - 2 L  (L - L  ) | dt |d = - 2 c - L2 - L2  - 2 L  (L - L  ) | dt 2

|t |2 = t s (a , a) 1 - |t |2

(24)

10 + (L - L  )|  d (26)

Inserting this expression in the condition (25), one finds not only that squeezed states are preserved but also the equations for the squeezing parameters are dt = - t (1 + ct )dt (27)   dt = - t dt + t a s (1 + ct )dt + t d (28) 2 written in It^ form. Since the evolution of the squeezing parameter t is deterministic, o it is easy to find the unraveling which produces the fastest squeezing decay. It is given by the following correlation factor  (29) c= t |t | Notice that this unraveling depends on the state itself. In order to produce the maximal decay in squeezing, the noise term in the stochastic Schr¨dinger equation has to evolve o according to the prescription given in (29). For such an unraveling, the norm of the correlation factor c is kept constant at its maximal value |c| = 1 and the phase varied in time along each single trajectory in order to minimize the squeezing. For all the unravelings with a correlation factor having such phase but an arbitrary  norm {cr = rt /|t |, r  [0, 1]}, the localization rate can be easily computed. This set includes QSD which as r = 0 and the adaptive unraveling (29) which has r = 1. For every unraveling in this set, the squeezing parameter t decays as t  e-t for large enough times. Using the relation (24), one obtains  2 (a)  e-2t (a , a)  e-t for t  t (30)

Compared to the minimal localization rate of , this result shows that the unravelings which have a correlation factor c with the proper phase, i.e. all unravelings in the above mentioned set, produce a localization rate on squeezed states which is twice the minimal localization rate. Furthermore, the quantum mean square deviation (a , a) decays at the same rate as the energy. Thus, the time needed for a squeezed state to become a coherent state is of the same order as the dissipation time, making the squeezed state a favourite basis for numerical simulations. Squeezed states are frequently represented in phase space using distribution functions. The Q distribution of a squeezed state is a Gaussian whose contour forms an ellipse. It can be easily seen that the phase (29) of the correlation factor c is equal to ei2 where  is the angle between the real axis and the major axis of the ellipse. The correlation factor c is defined, irrespective of its norm, as the square of the noise term d (see (8)). Thus the phase of the noise term d, which produces the fastest squeezing decay, is the same as the phase of the major axis of the ellipse, this later being defined as ei . One can say that the unraveling varies in time in order to distribute the noise fluctuations along the axis of largest spread of the squeezed state.

11 If the system state is not a squeezed state, the previous derivation does not apply anymore. Nevertheless, we can try to generalize the result for an arbitrary state. Using the relation (24) between squeezing parameter and mean quantum deviation, the same unraveling can be specified as c= (a , a) |(a , a)| (31)

This expression allows us to generalize the criteria obtained for a squeezed state to an arbitrary state. This choice corresponds to fluctuations distributed along the major axis of the ellipse which will give the best approximation to the state distribution in phase space. Another interesting aspect of the unraveling (31) is that it is also the one which maximizes the drift term (21) in the d 2 (a) equation. This is not a sufficient condition to insure this unraveling localizes the most since this condition neglects statistical correlations. As soon as statistical correlations can be neglected, this unraveling will produce the highest localization rate. These two arguments show that for distributions which can be well approximated by ellipses, the unraveling (29) will give the highest localization rate. What happens with other states? To answer this question, numerical simulations have been employed. Using three different initial states, and three different unravelings, the evolution in time of the quantum mean square deviation  2 (a) has been computed. The ensemble average M 2 (a) taken over 1000 trajectories is represented in figures 1-3. The initial states  chosen are: a Fock state |24 , a superposition of Fock states (|23 + |25 )/ 2 and a  superposition of coherent states (| + | -  )/ 2 with  = 4. The unravelings chosen are: the unraveling with the proper phase (31), QSD with c = 0 and real noise with c = 1. All our simulations confirm that such quantum states are very unstable under the effect of dissipation [29], this being independent of the chosen unraveling. After a small time t < 1, the state becomes a squeezed state to a very good approximation. During the transition from an arbitrary initial state to an almost squeezed state, the rate of localization is very high. Once the state has become a squeezed state, the mean rate of localization is approximately constant for all the unravelings. The localization rate always lies in between the minimal rate  and the squeezed state rate 2 (see figure 4). The latter occurs only for the set of unravelings with the appropriate phase. For the unravelings with a different choice of phase, the term ct in equation (27) will give a negative contribution and produce a lower localization rate. In all numerical simulations, the new unraveling produced the highest localization. Finally, one can try to generalize the previous result to an arbitrary Lindblad operator. In this case, the unraveling which localize the most will be the one with

For a hermitian operator q, this expression reproduces the result previously obtained, namely c= (q  , q)  2 (q) = 2 =1 |(q  , q)| | (q)| (33)

for the real noise unraveling. For the annihilation operator L = a equation (32) is equivalent to (31). 3.3. Numerical simulations Instead of trying to justify further the unraveling (32) as the most localizing one for an arbitrary Lindblad operator we look for an estimate of the improvement produced by using such an unraveling in numerical simulations. The test consists of computing the quantum mean square deviation  2 (a) along a quantum trajectory with both the unraveling (31) and the QSD unraveling. The ensemble average M 2 (a) which gives a measure of the size of the wave packet as well as the variance Var{ 2 (a)} = 2 M ( 2 (a) - M 2 (a)) which measures the fluctuations of the wave packet size are then compared between the two unravelings. The quantity  2 (a) is taken here as a measure of the size of the wave packet since it corresponds formally to the excitation number of the state displaced at the origin [27]. For a number states basis, this measure is proportional to the number of basis state needed to represent the state | . The system we used for this test is a kicked anharmonic oscillator 1 ¯ (34) H = i¯ (t)(a - a) + ha2 a2 h 2  subject to dissipation L = a. The driving (t) is a periodic sequence of rectangular pulses of height 0 , length 1 and separation 2 . In this case the Hamiltonian can also play an important role in the localization process. This system has been considered in previous publications [38, 39, 35] as a simple example of a chaotic system. In conjunction ~ ~ with this system, the scaling transformations: t = t,  = /, 0 = 0 ,  = /3 have ~ ~ been introduced. This scaling of the parameters does not affect the classical dynamics but when it is introduced in the quantum equations of motion, it allows one to perform the quantum-classical transition, by varying  from  = 1 (quantum) to    (classical). Here we use this transformation for a different purpose. In the quantum limit, nonlinear effects produce a strong delocalization which can not be compensated by the localization effect of the dissipation. In the classical limit, on the contrary, localization is expected to be dominant. Thus varying the scaling factor allows us to tune the relative strength of the delocalization.

The upper curve corresponds to the QSD unraveling and the lower curve to the time dependent unraveling (31). The errors bars take into account statistical as well as numerical accuracy uncertainties.

In figure 5, the ensemble average and variance of the quantum square deviation  2 (a) are represented for different values of the scaling parameter . The values represented are stationary results obtained by integrating the equations of motions over typically 2500 periods and taking the mean over a single trajectory. Such a long integration in time is necessary in order to obtain a proper average over the strange attractor of the chaotic system. The system parameters are set to the following values  = 1, 0 = 2,  = 0.5, 1 = 0.98 and 2 = 1 for which the classical system is known to be chaotic. The precision of the numerical results is estimated by repeating the calculations for different numerical parameters such as the time step size. Figure 5(a) shows for both unravelings a slowly decaying ensemble average M 2 (a) for an increasing value of the scaling . Notice that the amplitude of motion rescales as  thus the ratio  2 (a)/M a a tends towards zero when   , providing a numerical justification for the emergence of the classical attractor. Furthermore, fig 5(a) shows that the unraveling (31) reduces, compared to the QSD unraveling, the stationary value of the mean size of the wave packet. The reduction can be up to 20% depending on the scale parameter , the largest reduction being achieved in the quantum regime. More important is the reduction of the size of the fluctuations shown in fig 5(b). The picture suggested is that each time the wave packet deviates from a coherent state the QSD unraveling tends to restore the shape by applying a homogeneous noise, while the unraveling (31) adapts by applying a non-homogeneous noise in the direction of the largest deviation. This adaptability does not produce an important reduction of the wave packet size but can stabilize the wave packet more efficiently as compared to QSD.

16 4. Discussion

We have introduced the set of continuous unravelings which recovers in mean the master equation in Lindblad form and preserves the norm of the state vector. The quantum state diffusion unraveling is a member of this set, being the simplest which preserves the same invariance properties under unitary transformations as the density matrix. We have seen that each single unraveling can be specified very simply by the choice of the noise correlations thus providing a natural classification. For theoretical purposes, it is useful to work with the full set of continuous unravelings since it allows one to study how quantities which depend on the choice of the unraveling are sensitive to this choice. As a first application, we have studied the localization properties when only a single Lindblad operator is present. In the case of a hermitian operator, the highest localization rate of the real noise unraveling as well as the absence of localization of the imaginary noise unraveling have been recovered and explained in a consistent way. For a non hermitian operator, namely the annihilation operator, a new time dependent unraveling has been introduced. It is shown analytically that this unraveling provides the highest localization rate for squeezed states and numerically that this property is also valid for more complex quantum states. This unraveling maximizes the localization by continuously adjusting the phase noise according to the shape of the wave packet. This study provides a better understanding of the localization. For instance, the QSD unraveling is known to have good localization properties due to its invariance corresponding, in some sense, to a homogeneous distribution of noise. We have seen that the localization rate can be increased by maximizing the norm of the noise correlation factor and adjusting continuously its phase, this last constraint leading to the introduction of a time dependent unraveling. Since the new unraveling increases localization it is a good candidate for numerical simulations of quantum trajectories and for the solution of the master equation. A numerical comparison of the wave packet size and fluctuations between QSD and the new unraveling shows that the new unraveling performs better than QSD by stabilizing the size of the wave packet. In connection with the study of the quantum-classical transition, a recent work by Brun et al [27] has shown that the Quantum Jump unraveling tends to a continuous unraveling. It can be easily seen that this unraveling is a member of the set introduced in the present paper. We have shown that for a simple quantum system subject to dissipation all members of the set of continuous unravelings localize with a minimal rate given by the dissipation rate, making localization a general property valid for all unravelings instead of only some particular ones.

In the case of a linear combination of two Wiener process N = 2, the noise term d is specified by the two complex numbers 1 and 2 which we write as 1 = 1 ei1 and 2 = 2 ei2 . The noise correlation factor becomes c=
2 n 2 e2i1 + 2 e2i2 2 = 1 2 2 + 2 n |n | 1 2 n

Using R = 2 /1 and  = 2(2 - 1 ), this complex number can be rewritten as c = e2i1 1 + R2 ei 1 + R2

If 1 = 0 and R are kept constant and  is varied, the denominator will give a circle in the complex plane, centered at (1,0) and of radius R2 . The denominator will restrict the circle to be inside the unit disk, centered at the origin. The phase 1 produces only a rotation around the origin. Thus the number c can take any value inside the unit circle only: |c|  1. Furthermore, this result can be generalized without difficulty for an arbitrary number N of noise terms. References

Abstract I first review a) the flowering of coherent states in the 1960's, yet b) the discovery of coherent states in 1926, and c) the flowering of squeezed states in the 1970's and 1980's. Then, with the background of the excitement over the then new quantum mechanics, I describe d) the discovery of squeezed states in 1927.

Coherent States

Coherent states are important in many fields of physics [1, 2]. This became widely recognized during the 1960's due to the work of Glauber [3], Klauder [4, 5], and Sudarshan [5, 6]. In modern parlance, they are standardly defined in three equivalent ways: 1) Displacement-Operator Method. For the harmonic oscillator, coherent states, | , are given by the unitary displacement operator acting on the ground state: 1 D()|0 = exp - ||2 2 n  |n  | , n! (1) (2)

n

The generalization of this method to arbitrary Lie groups has an involved history.2 (See Refs. [7, 8] and later reviews [1, 2].) One simply applies the generalized displacement operator, which is the unitary exponentiation of the factor algebra, on to an extremal state. 2) Ladder- (Annihilation-) Operator Method. For the harmonic oscillator, the coherent states are also the eigenstates of the destruction operator: a| = | . (3)

D() = exp[a -  a] = exp[-||2 /2] exp[a ] exp[- a] .

That these states are the same as the displacement-operator states follows from Eq. (1), since 0 = D()a|0 = (a - )D()|0 = (a - )| . (4)

Email: mmn@pion.lanl.gov Unknown to many, Klauder developed this method in an early paper [7].

The generalization to arbitrary Lie groups is straight forward, and has also been studied [1, 2]. 3) Minimum-Uncertainty Method. This method, as we will see in the next section, intuitively harks back to Schr¨dinger's discovery of the coherent states [9]. o For the harmonic oscillator, the classical variables x and p vary as the sin and the cos of the classical t. If one then takes these "natural" classical variables and transforms them into quantum operators, they define a commutation relation and an uncertainty relation: [x, p] = i, 1 (x)2 (p)2  . 4 (5)

The states that minimize this uncertainty relation are given by the solutions to the equation x+ i p mus = 2(p)2 x + i p 2(p)2 mus . (6)

[Of the four parameters x , x2 , p , and p2 , only three are independent because the equality in the uncertainty relation is satisfied.] Rewrite Eq. (6) as (x + iBp) mus = Cmus , B= x , p C = x + iB p . (7)

Here B is real and C is complex. These states, mus (B, C), are the minimum-uncertainty states. B can be adjusted to B0 so that the ground-eigenstate is a member of the set. Then these restricted states, mus (B = B0 , C) = cs (B0 , C), are the minimum-uncertainty coherent states: cs =  -1/4 exp - (x - x0 )2 + ip0 x . 2 (8)

By the use of the Hermite polynomial generating function, and with the identifications  = 1 + i2 = x0 + ip0  , 2 (9)

it can be shown that Eqs. (1) and (8) are equivalent. This method has been applied to general Hamiltonian potential and symmetry systems, yielding generalized coherent states [10]. The coherent wave packets are Gaussians, with widths that of the ground-state Gaussian. With time, the centroid of the packet follows the classical motion and does not change its shape.

The Discovery of Coherent States

The first half of 1926 was an amazingly productive period for Erwin Schr¨dinger. He submitted o six important papers [9], beginning with his fundamental paper solving the hydrogen-atom. There was, of course, tremendous controversy surrounding Schr¨dinger's work. In particular o Lorentz wrote to Schr¨dinger on May 27 lamenting the fact that his wave functions were stationary, o and did not display classical motion. On June 6 Schr¨dinger replied that he had found a system o where classical motion was seen, and sent Lorentz a draft copy of the paper we are interested in, ¨ Der stetige Ubergang von der Mikro- zur Makromechanik [9]. 2

Using the generating function found in the classic book of Courant and Hilbert, Schr¨dinger o realized that a Gaussian wave-function could be constructed from a particular superposition of the wave functions corresponding to the discrete eigenvalues of the harmonic oscillator. Further, these new states followed the classical motion. At this time the probability-amplitude nature of the wave function was not yet known, so the complex nature of the wave function bothered Schr¨dinger. o He wondered if, perhaps, it was only the real part of the wave function that is physical. But in any event, even though the uncertainty relation had yet to be discovered, from a view point that most closely resembles the modern minimum-uncertainty method, Schr¨dinger had o discovered the coherent states. During this period there was great rivalry between Schr¨dinger and the "young Turks," Heiseno berg and Pauli. Indeed, Pauli felt it necessary to mollify Schr¨dinger after having called his views, o 3 "local Z¨ rich superstitions." Heisenberg was even stronger, saying Schr¨dinger's physical picture u o makes scarcely any sense, "..in other words, I think it is crap."4 -- Then again, Werner was hard to please. He later called the Dirac theory, "learned crap."5 (See Ref. [12].) This period amusingly came to an end when Born corrected himself in proof. He realized that the probability was not proportional to the wave function, but to its square.

Squeezed States

Squeezed states were mathematically rediscovered and discussed by many authors [13], especially in the 1970's and early 80's. Each author tended to emphasize differing aspects of the system. Interest grew in squeezed states as it began to appear that experimentalists might be able to observe them [15]. This was first true in the field of gravitational-wave detection [16]. (Indeed, the term "squeezed states" was coined in the context of Weber-bar gravitational-wave detection [14].) But, especially with the quantum-optics experimental breakthroughs starting in the mid1980's [17], the field exploded, as evidenced also by the present conference series. As coherent states, the more general squeezed states can be defined in three equivalent ways: 1) Displacement-Operator Method. To obtain squeezed states, one applies both the squeeze and displacement operators onto the ground state: z = rei = z1 + iz2 ,

D()S(z)|0 = |, z ,

S(z) = exp

(10)

( 2 +a a) 1 1 1 i   (11) exp - e-i (tanh r)aa . S(z) = exp e (tanh r)a a 2 cosh r 2 The ordering of DS vs. SD in Eq. (10) is equivalent, amounting to a change of parameters. 2) Ladder- (Annihilation-) Operator Method. Using a Holstein-Primakoff/Bogoliubov transformation, DSaS -1 D -1 is a linear combination of a and a , that yields

(cosh r)a - (ei sinh r)a |, z = (cosh r) - (ei sinh r) .|, z

3) Minimum-Uncertainty Method. If one takes the convention z = r = Real , which is valid because  amounts to an initial time, t0 , one can return to Eq. (6) and realize that the mus are squeezed states. To include the phase explicitly, one moves a step further [18] than the Heisenberg uncertainty relation to the Schr¨dinger uncertainty relation [19]: o (x)2 (p)2  | [x, p]/2 + {x, p}/2 |2. (13)

The states which satisfy this uncertainty relation, and which can be shown to be equivalent to the other formulations [20], are ss = e-ix0 p0 /2 (x - x0 )2 exp - F2 + ip0 x ,  1/4 [F1 ]1/2 2 cosh r - ei sinh r , cosh r + ei sinh r (14)

F1 = cosh r + ei sinh r,

F2 =

(15)

With time, the centroids of these wave packets also follow the classical motion, but they do not retain their shapes. The width of a particular Gaussian oscillates as [x(t)]2 = [(cosh r)2 + (sinh r)2 + 2(cosh r)(sinh r) cos(2t - )], [p(t)]2 = [(cosh r)2 + (sinh r)2 - 2(cosh r)(sinh r) cos(2t - )], 4[x(t)]2 [p(t)]2 = 1 + (16) (17)

1 2 1 2 s - 2 sin2 (2t - ), s = er . (18) 4 s Generalizations have been given for other systems [21, 22]. Further, from Eq. (13), one can realize that generalized intelligent states [22] are, in fact, generalized squeezed states.

The Discovery of Squeezed States

In 1926 a Cornell University assistant professor, Earle Hesse Kennard (born 1885), was granted a sabbatical. Upon his return he would be would be promoted to full professor. In October Kennard arrived at Max Born's Institut f¨ r Theoretische Physik of the University of G¨ttingen, u o where Heisenberg and Jordan had also worked. There Kennard mastered the matrix mechanics of Heisenberg and the wave mechanics of Schr¨dinger. o At the same time, Heisenberg submitted his uncertainty relation paper and went to Copenhagen to work with Bohr. By the spring of 1927, Bohr was working on his famous Como talk on the uncertainty relation, which later became a special supplement to Nature. Kennard moved to Copenhagen on March 7. While there he completed the manuscript in which squeezed states were discovered [23], Zur Quantenmechanik einfacher Bewegungstypen. Kennard acknowledges the help of Bohr and Heisenberg in the paper. Also, in the grand European-professor tradition, Kennard left the paper with Bohr for Bohr to review and approve it, and then to submit it [24]. The paper itself begins with a review of matrix and wave mechanics. Then Kennard discusses the time-evolution of three systems: i) a particle in an electric field, ii) a particle in a magnetic field, and, so important to us, in Sec. 4C iii) a general Gaussian in a harmonic oscillator potential. 4

Kennard observes that the classical motion is followed and, in his own notation, gives the critical Eqs. (16)-(18) above. He also explains their meaning, i.e., that a) the sum of the uncertainties in x and p is a constant, b) the uncertainty product varies from the minimum as sin2 2t [sin2 t cos2 t], c) the product has a minimum only twice each half period,6 and d) when the uncertainties are equal (in natural units) then the (coherent) states of Schr¨dinger [9] are obtained. In o other words, he had everything. One can speculate why the papers of Schr¨dinger [9] and Kennard [23] were, in the main, o ignored for so long. I think the simple answer is that they were too far ahead of their time. During the 20's, most would have felt it was inconceivable that this work meant more than a matter of principle. It would be decades before connection was made to experiment. To be popular in physics you have to either be good or lucky. Sometimes it is better to be lucky. But if you are going to be good, perhaps you shouldn't be too good. A more detailed version of this discussion will appear elsewhere [25].

Fidelity for displaced squeezed thermal states and the oscillator semigroup
H. Scutaru
Department of Theoretical Physics, Institute of Atomic Physics POB MG-6, Bucharest-Magurele, Romania e-mail: scutaru@theor1.ifa.ro (May 5, 1997) The fidelity for two displaced squeezed thermal states is computed using the fact that the corresponding density operators belong to the oscillator semigroup. Pacs Nos: 03.65.Bz; 03.65.Fd; 42.50.Dv.; 89.70.+c

arXiv:quant-ph/9708013v1 7 Aug 1997

The concept of fidelity is a basic ingredient in quantum communication theory [1, 2]. Recently the corresponding Bures distance was used [3] to define a measure of the entanglement as the minimal Bures distance of an entangled state to the set of disentangled states. Let 1 and 2 be the density operators which describe two impure states. The natural candidate for the fidelity, denoted by F (1 , 2 ), is the transition probability which must satisfy the following natural axioms:
· F1 F (1 , 2 )  1 and F (1 , 2 ) = 1 if and only if 1 = 2 ; · F2 F (1 , 2 ) = F (2 , 1 ); · F3 If 1 is a pure state 1 = |1 >< 1 | then F (1 , 2 ) =< 1 |2 |1 >; · F4 F (1 , 2 ) is invariant under unitary transformations on the state space.

the semigroup of integral operators on L2 (R) whose integral kernels are Gaussians. The density operators which describe the displaced squeezed thermal states belongs evidently to this semigroup. Indeed the oscillator semigroup (or its closure) contains the semigroup generated by the Hermite operator [13, 14] which is the Hamiltonian of the quantum oscillator (and respectively the range of metaplectic representation which generate the squeezing [15, 16]). The most general Gaussian density operator in coordinate representation is an integral operator:
+

()(x) =
-

< x||y > (y)dy

(2)

where < x||y >= exp [-(ax2 + dy 2 + 2bxy) + lx + ky + g] (3) In order that  be a quantum density operator it must be Hermitian, normalizable and non-negative [16]. Hermiticity for  requires d = a, b = ¯ k = ¯ and g = g ¯ b, l ¯ (Rel)2 [16]. From trace = 1 it follows that g = - 2(Rea+b) - ln
 2(Rea+b)

Uhlmann's transition probability for mixed states [4]  1  F (1 , 2 ) = [trace( 1 2 1 ) 2 ]2 (1)

does satisfy F1-F4. Investigations into detalied structure of the fidelity has been hampered by the complicated square-root factors in (1). Due to these technical difficulties in computing fidelity few concrete results concerning the details of the fidelity have been found. Until recently all known concrete results have been calculated only for finite dimensional Hilbert spaces [5-7]. The first result in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space has been obtained by Twamley [8] for the fidelity of two undisplaced thermal states. Twamley combines the Schur factorization with Baker-CampbellHausdorff identities. But as he said these arguments do not seem to hold for displaced squeezed thermal states. We have obtained the fidelity for two displaced thermal states [9] using a result of Wilcox [10]. In the following we shall use a completely new method for the treatement of the complicated square-root factors in (1) in the case of two displaced squeezed thermal states (i.e. in the case of two displaced mixed quasi-free states [11]). The basic ingredient of the method is the oscillator semigroup [12, 13]. The oscillator semigroup is 1

< || > for all | > it follows [16] that -b  0. Hence Rea  -b  0. For two quantum density operators 1 and 2 we have the semigroup composition law
+

and Rea  -b. From the non-negativity of

< x|1 |z >< z|2 |y > dz

(4)

Let us denote by A, B, D, L, K and G the corresponding parameters of the Gaussian < x|1 2 |y >. Then the semigroup composition law (the rule R1) is given by A = a1 - b2 b2 2 1 , D = d2 - d1 + a2 d1 + a2 b1 b2 (k1 + l2 )b1 B=- , L = l1 - d1 + a2 d1 + a2 (k1 + l2 )b2 K = k2 - d1 + a2 (k1 + l2 )  G = g1 + g2 + + ln 4(d1 + a2 ) d1 + a2

 We shall define the operator  as the integral operator with the Gaussian kernel  ~ a bxy) + ~ + ky + g ] lx ~ ~ < x| |y >= exp [-(~x2 + dy 2 + 2~ (6) such that
+

d = a and ¯ b=- detA - 1 4aqq (13)

< x||y >=
-

  < x| |z >< z| |y > dz

(7)

In order to simplify the calculations we shall use the property F4. Then it suffices to consider that 1 is a thermal state (i.e. an undisplaced and unsqueezed state) and that only 2 is a displaced squeezed thermal state. It is well known that in this case [14]: 1 < x|1 |y >= exp[- coth (x2 + y 2 ) + 2  xy - ln ] sinh tanh If 2 is an undisplaced squeezed thermal state with:


Then using the above given semigroup composition rule R1 one obtains by inversion the following rule (R2) for the square-root of a density operator: a=a-b ~ ~ d=d-b ~ = - -b(a + d - 2b) b

(14)

(8)

where the minus sign was choosen in order to have -~  0. Also b ~+ k = l ~ l+k 1+2
-b a+d-2b

< x|2 |y >= exp [-(ax2 + dy 2 + 2bxy) + g ]





(15)

then the displaced squeezed thermal state 2 is obtained  as 2 = W (,  )2 W (-, - ) and the corresponding ker nel is given by < x|2 |y >= exp [i (x - y)] < x-|2 |x-  > i.e. < x|2 |y >= exp [-(ax2 + dy 2 + 2bxy) + lx + ky + g] (16) where l = 2(a+d)+i , k = ¯ and g = g -(a+d+2b)2. l Now we can use the rules R1 and R2. After long but simple calculations we obtain the main result of the paper:

We study the output properties of a pulsed atom laser consisting of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a magnetic trap and an additional rf field transferring atoms to an untrapped Zeeman sublevel. For weak output coupling we calculate the dynamics of the decaying condensate population, of its chemical potential and the velocity of the output atoms analytically.

The experimental breakthrough to Bose-Einstein condensation with small numbers of atoms in magnetic traps [1] has raised much interest in the properties of mesoscopic quantum gases. Bose-Einstein condensates with atoms in a single magnetic sublevel have been studied experimentally and theoretically. The recent experimental and theoretical investigations of interference between two independent Bose-Einstein condensates convincingly proved their macroscopic coherence [2,3]. Moreover, the laser-like coherence of the atoms is preserved in the presence of a matter-wave splitter based on rf-transitions pumping the atoms into untrapped magnetic sublevels [4]. These states are either strong-field seeking or have no magnetic moment at all, and leave the trap. Alternatively, optical Raman transitions can be used for the transfer [5,6]. Such schemes provide controllable output couplers for coherent atom lasers. In analogy to a laser one can distinguish between a cw laser, based on continuous refilling of the condensate, and a pulsed atom laser where the condensate is periodically refilled and slowly released, similar to [4]. Whereas a continuous wave atom laser has been studied only theoretically [6­8], current Bose-Einstein condensation experiments are limited to the pulsed mode of operation. The closest approximation of a cw atom laser by a pulsed one can be reached in the limit of a weak coupling rf field. In this case we are able to describe the decay of the trapped condensate and its energy width analytically. Previous calculations addressed the opposite limit of strong coupling by numerical calculations [9] or neglected the important influence of atom-atom interactions [10]. The output coupler consists of a monochromatic resonant rf field of frequency rf transferring 23 Na atoms in the F = 1 hyperfine state from the trapped m = -1 into the untrapped m = 0 and the repelled m = 1 magnetic sublevels. For simplicity an isotropic harmonic trap

2 potential V-1 (r) = Voff + M T r2 /2, V+1 (r) = -V-1 (r) and V0 (r)  0 are assumed while effects of gravity are neglected. The three coupled coherent matter waves are described by a three-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with resonant excitation in rotating wave approximation first studied for a generic two-level system in Ref. [9]. In the following we adopt the point of view of spontaneously broken gauge symmetry for a Bose gas initially at zero temperature. The system of equations for the ~ ^ macroscopic wave funtion m (t) = e-imrf t m (t) in ro tating wave approximation for m, m  {-1, 0, +1} now reads  i¯ m (r, t)= h ~ t h ¯ 2 2 ~ ~ - + Vm (r) + hmrf + U ||(r, t)||2 m (r, t) ¯ 2M ~ +¯  h (1) (m,m +1 + m,m -1 )m (r, t). m

Here, we have replaced the atomic density by the modulus of the wave function ~ n(r, t) = ||(r, t)||2 = ^

~ |m (r, t)|2 .

 The coupling constant h = gµBohr |B|/ 2 refers to the ¯ Rabi frequency due to the rf field. At zero magnetic field the symmetrized s-wave scattering matrix elements Umm = 4¯ 2 amm /M for an elastic collision of a pair of h atoms in the sublevels m, m  {-1, 0, +1} are all nearly equal to a = 53a0 , (a0 is the Bohr radius), according to preliminary calculations of E. Tiesinga and P. S. Julienne [11]. Since the steady state operation depends mainly on the initial condensate mean field, we assume in the following a diagonal scattering matrix amm = mm a for simplicity. Consequently, the Hartree mean field potential for each spin component is equal to the total atom density n(r, t) multiplied by U = 4¯ 2 a/M . ^ h The initial condition is chosen as the solution of the stationary GPE for the trapped condensate in the absence of the rf field, i.e  = 0 in Eq. (1). In the ThomasFermi approximation it reads ~ |-1 (r, 0)|2 = max µ + Voff - V-1 (r) ,0 . U (3)

For a small coupling strength (  T ) the process of atoms leaking out of the resonance points is faster than 1

the Rabi oscillations. Therefore the coupling into state m = +1 can be neglected, since it is proportional to 4 . In the following only the states m = -1 and m = 0 are considered. After switching on the coupling due to the rf field, initial oscillations die out quickly, because the untrapped atoms leak out of the trap within less than one Rabi cycle. Other condensate atoms move into the resonance area replacing the leaving ones. Eventually a quasi-stationary state is reached, i.e. the m = -1 condensate wave function decays slowly without oscillations while the atoms coupled out of the condensate are expelled due to the mean-field potential and form a steady current. A numerical solution of the two-component GPE shows the uniform decay of the trapped condensate (cf. Fig. 1). The sum of external and mean field potentials is in a good approximation spatially independent inside the condensate so that a description of the decay in terms of the chemical potential µ(t) is appropriate. In the following we present an analytical calculation of the time dependent output intensity in this quasi-stationary regime, assuming a three dimensional isotropic harmonic trap. We first calculate the rate  of transitions from the condensate into the output. In the spirit of the ThomasFermi approximation we neglect the kinetic energy in a two-component GPE corresponding to Eq. (1) and solve for the output density distribution ~ |0 (r, t)|2 = 42 sin2 [ 1 2 (r) + 42 t] ~ 2 |-1 (r, 0)|2 . 2 (r) + 42 (4) The maximum amplitude of the Rabi oscillations is located at rres determined by the resonance condition h ¯ (rres ) = 0 (5)

The calculation of the above rate (t) does not account for the losses due to the leaving atoms. However, a rate equation allowing for these losses can be derived in the limit of weak coupling by using the perturbational rate (t  /)  = 8 2 ¯ 2 h 2¯ (0) h 2 (M T )3/2 (7)

with  (rres ) = 2(0)/rres . Due to the spatial localization of the output coupling, the decay of the condensate population N (t)  ~ d3 r|-1 (r, t)|2 , N (0) = N0 (8)

depends solely on the density of the atoms around the resonance shell with radius rres dN (t) ~ = - |-1 (rres , t)|2 . dt (9)

In the quasi-stationary regime we assume the shape of the condensate density being equal to the Thomas-Fermi solution of the stationary GPE (cf. Fig. 1) with a slowly varying atom number N (t), N (t) = 4 2 [2µ(t)]5/2 /(M T )3/2 . 15U (10)

The condensate density at the resonance points is then given by ~ |-1 (rres , t)|2 = [µ(t) - ¯ (0)]/U. h (11)

Inserting this into the decay law (9) we obtain a nonlinear differential equation for the decay of the chemical potential d µ - ¯ (0) h µ+ = 0, dt µ3/2
2 where  = 3(M T )3/2 2-7/2  -1 . Integration yields

where ¯ (r) = hrf - V-1 (r). Thus, the main contrih ¯ bution to the output coupling stems from a small shell around that resonance radius. The time-derivative of the density gives the density transition rate. The total transition rate is obtained by integrating the position dependent rate over the condensate volume. The transition rate is negligible outside a minute resonance shell and strongly peaked within that shell. Expanding the position dependent detuning (r) to first order one obtains the time dependent transition probability (t)  1 ~-1 (rres , 0)|2 |

With Eq. (10) this yields additionally the time evolution for the number of trapped atoms N (t) as well as the flux and the velocity of the untrapped atoms. During the depopulation of the condensate the chemical potential and the spatial extension of the condensate decrease until the resonance points lie on the surface of the shrinked condensate. At this point the flux out of the ~ condensate vanishes, because |-1 (rres , t)|2 = 0, and the 2

chemical potential and the number of atoms remaining in the trap become constant in time µ() = h(0). ¯ (14)

As an example we chose a small value of (0) and a trap frequency T = 2 × 106 Hz, the geometric mean of the values given in Ref. [4]. The resulting time evolution of the system variables according to the nonlinear differential equation is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b). The chemical potential µ(t) and the number of trapped atoms reach their steady state after roughly 25 seconds. Correspondingly the flux and the velocity of the untrapped atoms decrease to zero (cf. Figs. 2(c) and (d)). The corresponding calculations were also carried out in one dimension in order to compare the analytical expressions with numerical simulations of the full coupled GPE's. The results showed excellent agreement (less than 5 % deviation). The finite duration of the atom pulse ejected from the trap leads to a finite energy width of both the condensate and the output beam that is called here the natural energy width E of a pulsed atom laser, in analogy to the natural linewidth of spontaneously emitted photons. It can be calculated approximately by describing the initial stage of the output coupling process by an exponential decay of the condensate population dN (t) = -pop [N (t) - N ()]. dt The rate pop results in an energy uncertainty E = hpop  ¯ 15 5/2 2 (0) ¯ h 2 µ(0)3/2 (16) (15)

Whereas the transition rate  does not depend on µ and N0 , the population decay rate pop does so due to its ~ dependence on -1 (r, 0). We thus find a dependence of the energy width on the condensate number E  2 (0) . (17)

3/5 N0

The natural energy width becomes narrower for weaker coupling strength , i.e. a slower output coupling process. The same effect can be achieved by choosing a smaller detuning (0) which causes the sphere of the resonance points to shrink towards the center of the condensate. The energy width can further be reduced by starting out from a condensate with a large population N0 . The energy width E can also be understood as a velocity width v = E/(M v) of the untrapped atoms leaving the condensate. The parameters given in Fig. 2 result in v = 1.31cm/s for the velocity outside the condensate and v/ v  10-6 for the relative velocity width. 3

An additional energy width is imposed by the temporal decay of the chemical potential µ(t). It leads to a decrease of the output velocity according to M v(t)2 /2 = µ(t) - ¯ (0) thereby implying a frequency chirp of the h output beam. This frequency chirp can be compensated, however, by imposing a chirp on the frequency rf of the rf field such that the output velocity rather than the detuning (0) becomes constant. The output pulse can last for up to the order of 100 seconds such that causes of phase fluctuation which would also influence a cw-atom laser have to be considered as well. Additional broadening of the energy width of the output beam is caused by thermal excitations of the condensate wavefunction and technical noise of the output coupling mechanism such as fluctuations of the confining magnetic field. Thus, the natural energy width calculated above has to be understood as a lower limit. A comprehensive theoretical description of the fluctuations of the condensate wavefunction, particularily of its phase, is beyond the scope of this Letter. It has been shown in [6] that the temporal decay of phase correlations transforms into a decay of the spatial coherence of the output beam along the mean classical trajectory that is being passed during the according correlation time of the condensate phase. At present, random variations of the bias magnetic field at the mGauss level are among the most important experimental limitations to the coherence properties of the output, prior to fluctuations of the condensate wavefunction. They might contribute to a phase diffusion of the output beam in the 100 Hz range [12]. Pulsed atom lasers will play an important role in creating coherent matter waves as the size of the condensate may be largely increased in future experiments. The results of this Letter are based on the solutions of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and allow us to extract the relevant properties of the output analytically. The velocity of the untrapped atoms depends on the slowly decaying population of the trapped condensate fraction, leading to a slow chirp of the output frequency. While this frequency chirp might be compensated by a variation of the rf-field frequency, other sources of spectral width like fluctuations of the confining magnetic field are surely more difficult to overcome.

We study the output properties of a pulsed atom laser consisting of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a magnetic trap and an additional rf field transferring atoms to an untrapped Zeeman sublevel.

Previous calculations addressed the opposite limit of strong coupling by numerical calculations [9] or neglected the important influence of atom-atom interactions [10]. The output coupler consists of a monochromatic resonant rf field of frequency rf transferring 23 Na atoms in the F = 1 hyperfine state from the trapped m = -1 into the untrapped m = 0 and the repelled m = 1 magnetic sublevels. For simplicity an isotropic harmonic trap

2 potential V-1 (r) = Voff + M T r2 /2, V+1 (r) = -V-1 (r) and V0 (r)  0 are assumed while effects of gravity are neglected. The three coupled coherent matter waves are described by a three-component Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) with resonant excitation in rotating wave approximation first studied for a generic two-level system in Ref.

 The coupling constant h = gµBohr |B|/ 2 refers to the ¯ Rabi frequency due to the rf field. At zero magnetic field the symmetrized s-wave scattering matrix elements Umm = 4¯ 2 amm /M for an elastic collision of a pair of h atoms in the sublevels m, m  {-1, 0, +1} are all nearly equal to a = 53a0 , (a0 is the Bohr radius), according to preliminary calculations of E. Tiesinga and P. S. Julienne [11]. Since the steady state operation depends mainly on the initial condensate mean field, we assume in the following a diagonal scattering matrix amm = mm a for simplicity. Consequently, the Hartree mean field potential for each spin component is equal to the total atom density n(r, t) multiplied by U = 4¯ 2 a/M . ^ h The initial condition is chosen as the solution of the stationary GPE for the trapped condensate in the absence of the rf field, i.e  = 0 in Eq. (1). In the ThomasFermi approximation it reads ~ |-1 (r, 0)|2 = max µ + Voff - V-1 (r) ,0 . U (3)

For a small coupling strength (  T ) the process of atoms leaking out of the resonance points is faster than 1

the Rabi oscillations. Therefore the coupling into state m = +1 can be neglected, since it is proportional to 4 . In the following only the states m = -1 and m = 0 are considered. After switching on the coupling due to the rf field, initial oscillations die out quickly, because the untrapped atoms leak out of the trap within less than one Rabi cycle. Other condensate atoms move into the resonance area replacing the leaving ones. Eventually a quasi-stationary state is reached, i.e. the m = -1 condensate wave function decays slowly without oscillations while the atoms coupled out of the condensate are expelled due to the mean-field potential and form a steady current. A numerical solution of the two-component GPE shows the uniform decay of the trapped condensate (cf. Fig. 1). The sum of external and mean field potentials is in a good approximation spatially independent inside the condensate so that a description of the decay in terms of the chemical potential µ(t) is appropriate. In the following we present an analytical calculation of the time dependent output intensity in this quasi-stationary regime, assuming a three dimensional isotropic harmonic trap. We first calculate the rate  of transitions from the condensate into the output. In the spirit of the ThomasFermi approximation we neglect the kinetic energy in a two-component GPE corresponding to Eq.

The calculation of the above rate (t) does not account for the losses due to the leaving atoms. However, a rate equation allowing for these losses can be derived in the limit of weak coupling by using the perturbational rate (t  /)  = 8 2 ¯ 2 h 2¯ (0) h 2 (M T )3/2 (7)

with  (rres ) = 2(0)/rres . Due to the spatial localization of the output coupling, the decay of the condensate population N (t)  ~ d3 r|-1 (r, t)|2 , N (0) = N0 (8)

depends solely on the density of the atoms around the resonance shell with radius rres dN (t) ~ = - |-1 (rres , t)|2 . dt (9)

In the quasi-stationary regime we assume the shape of the condensate density being equal to the Thomas-Fermi solution of the stationary GPE (cf. Fig. 1) with a slowly varying atom number N (t), N (t) = 4 2 [2µ(t)]5/2 /(M T )3/2 . 15U (10)

The condensate density at the resonance points is then given by ~ |-1 (rres , t)|2 = [µ(t) - ¯ (0)]/U. h (11)

Inserting this into the decay law (9) we obtain a nonlinear differential equation for the decay of the chemical potential d µ - ¯ (0) h µ+ = 0, dt µ3/2

where ¯ (r) = hrf - V-1 (r). Thus, the main contrih ¯ bution to the output coupling stems from a small shell around that resonance radius. The time-derivative of the density gives the density transition rate. The total transition rate is obtained by integrating the position dependent rate over the condensate volume. The transition rate is negligible outside a minute resonance shell and strongly peaked within that shell. Expanding the position dependent detuning (r) to first order one obtains the time dependent transition probability (t)  1 ~-1 (rres , 0)|2 |

With Eq. (10) this yields additionally the time evolution for the number of trapped atoms N (t) as well as the flux and the velocity of the untrapped atoms. During the depopulation of the condensate the chemical potential and the spatial extension of the condensate decrease until the resonance points lie on the surface of the shrinked condensate. At this point the flux out of the ~ condensate vanishes, because |-1 (rres , t)|2 = 0, and the 2

chemical potential and the number of atoms remaining in the trap become constant in time µ() = h(0). ¯ (14)

As an example we chose a small value of (0) and a trap frequency T = 2 × 106 Hz, the geometric mean of the values given in Ref. [4]. The resulting time evolution of the system variables according to the nonlinear differential equation is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b). The chemical potential µ(t) and the number of trapped atoms reach their steady state after roughly 25 seconds. Correspondingly the flux and the velocity of the untrapped atoms decrease to zero (cf. Figs. 2(c) and (d)). The corresponding calculations were also carried out in one dimension in order to compare the analytical expressions with numerical simulations of the full coupled GPE's. The results showed excellent agreement (less than 5 % deviation). The finite duration of the atom pulse ejected from the trap leads to a finite energy width of both the condensate and the output beam that is called here the natural energy width E of a pulsed atom laser, in analogy to the natural linewidth of spontaneously emitted photons. It can be calculated approximately by describing the initial stage of the output coupling process by an exponential decay of the condensate population dN (t) = -pop [N (t) - N ()]. dt The rate pop results in an energy uncertainty E = hpop  ¯ 15 5/2 2 (0) ¯ h 2 µ(0)3/2 (16) (15)

Whereas the transition rate  does not depend on µ and N0 , the population decay rate pop does so due to its ~ dependence on -1 (r, 0). We thus find a dependence of the energy width on the condensate number E  2 (0) . (17)

3/5 N0

The natural energy width becomes narrower for weaker coupling strength , i.e. a slower output coupling process. The same effect can be achieved by choosing a smaller detuning (0) which causes the sphere of the resonance points to shrink towards the center of the condensate. The energy width can further be reduced by starting out from a condensate with a large population N0 . The energy width E can also be understood as a velocity width v = E/(M v) of the untrapped atoms leaving the condensate. The parameters given in Fig. 2 result in v = 1.31cm/s for the velocity outside the condensate and v/ v  10-6 for the relative velocity width. 3

An additional energy width is imposed by the temporal decay of the chemical potential µ(t). It leads to a decrease of the output velocity according to M v(t)2 /2 = µ(t) - ¯ (0) thereby implying a frequency chirp of the h output beam. This frequency chirp can be compensated, however, by imposing a chirp on the frequency rf of the rf field such that the output velocity rather than the detuning (0) becomes constant. The output pulse can last for up to the order of 100 seconds such that causes of phase fluctuation which would also influence a cw-atom laser have to be considered as well. Additional broadening of the energy width of the output beam is caused by thermal excitations of the condensate wavefunction and technical noise of the output coupling mechanism such as fluctuations of the confining magnetic field. Thus, the natural energy width calculated above has to be understood as a lower limit. A comprehensive theoretical description of the fluctuations of the condensate wavefunction, particularily of its phase, is beyond the scope of this Letter. It has been shown in [6] that the temporal decay of phase correlations transforms into a decay of the spatial coherence of the output beam along the mean classical trajectory that is being passed during the according correlation time of the condensate phase. At present, random variations of the bias magnetic field at the mGauss level are among the most important experimental limitations to the coherence properties of the output, prior to fluctuations of the condensate wavefunction. They might contribute to a phase diffusion of the output beam in the 100 Hz range [12]. Pulsed atom lasers will play an important role in creating coherent matter waves as the size of the condensate may be largely increased in future experiments. The results of this Letter are based on the solutions of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and allow us to extract the relevant properties of the output analytically. The velocity of the untrapped atoms depends on the slowly decaying population of the trapped condensate fraction, leading to a slow chirp of the output frequency. While this frequency chirp might be compensated by a variation of the rf-field frequency, other sources of spectral width like fluctuations of the confining magnetic field are surely more difficult to overcome.

It is done via generalized distillation protocol using generalized XOR and twirling operations. The latter leads to the construction of family of states describing generalized depolarising channel.

The physical processes are described by so called completely positive (CP) maps i.e. the maps which can be implemented by adding to the system of interest an ancilla in a certain state, subjecting then the whole system to a unitary transformation and performing reduction over the variables describing the ancilla [1]. Given a map, to assert it is completely positive it does not suffice to check whether it transforms state into state (we will identify state with density matrix in this paper). The maps satisfying such a condition are called positive. Here a stronger property is required: if a map acts only on one part of the composed system being in any initial state, the resulting operator describing the whole system must be still a state. In consequence, if we have sent down the quantum channel (described by a CP map) a particle which is entangled with another one, then the joint two-particle state is then still described by a positive operator. This asserts that the probabilities of outcomes of all possible measurements performed on the whole two-particle system remain positive. It is known that there are positive maps which fail to fulfil this condition, representing then a little physical interest. This is the reason why the structure of the positive maps has not been investigated carefully so far. In this light it turned to be quite a nice surprise that the positive maps being seemingly physically worthless mathematical objects can play an important role in the modern quantum information theory. Namely, it appears [2] that just the considerable fault of the positive maps makes them to be a useful tool in investigation of inseparability of mixed states, the latter problem being inevitably connected with the central problem of faithful transmission of quantum information via noisy quantum channels [3]. Indeed, if we consider separable states of a compound system, i.e. mixtures of product states, all the positive maps work well: they do not destroy positivity of the state of the whole system acting on one of the subsystems. The difference between CP and not-CP positive maps reveals if the initial state of the system is inseparable. If a CP map acts on one of the subsystem, nothing strange happens, the state changes, but remains positive. If we however send part of inseparable state through the (unphysical) channel formed by a positive map which is not CP, the density matrix describing the initial state can be turned into the operator which is no longer a state. This feature, unpleasant for physicists so far, allows in fact to distinguish between separable and inseparable states. To see how it works in practice note that when Peres [4] provided a partial transposition separability criterion, he in fact pointed out a proper positive map (transposition of matrix). That such (the simplest possible) choice was very accurate we have seen in [2], where it was proved that the criterion is equivalent to separability for 2 × 2 (and 2 × 3) systems, providing then an extremely simple method of determining whether a given state of the system is separable or not. To use the latter result in the domain of quantum error correction, it was desired to determine whether all the inseparable states can be converted into pure singlet form by means of local quantum operations and classical communication [8] (such a procedure is called distillation). This is an important problem, as if we do not know whether and how an inseparable state can be distilled, then we cannot benefit the entanglement undoubtly represented by the state. For the 2 × 2 case such a protocol was provided in Ref. [5]. It consisted of two stages: the first involving the one-side filtering (called also "Procrustean" method) [6,7] aimed at increasing the fraction of fully entangled vector and the second, basing on bilateral quantum XOR gates [8]. In this paper, utilizing some positive map, we obtain a separability criterion equivalent to separability for 2 × 2 systems, with the property that any state (on an arbitrary N × N system) which violates it, can be effectively distilled by the suitable generalization of the protocol given in Ref. [5]. Moreover the converse also holds: the only states which can be distilled by such a kind of protocols, necessarily violate the criterion. Then we also obtain a scope of the use of the considered class of protocols. It should be emphasized here that we concentrate on the question of type yes-no, i.e. whether a given state can be distilled or not. Then we are not careful about the question how large yield of pure entanglement will be obtained. As we have mentioned, any given positive (but not CP) map represents itself a separability criterion. Given such a map  : M N  M N (M N is the set of N × N matrices) the criterion writes as [2] (I  )  0 (1) i.e. we let the map act on one of the subsystems and impose the result to be still a positive operator (an operator is said to be positive if it has real, nonnegative eigenvalues). Here  acts on the Hilbert space C N  C N . If the state ~ ~ is separable (i.e. it is of the form  = i pi i  i , where i pi = 1, i and i are states of the subsystems) then it trivially fulfils the above condition since, due to positivity of , (~i ) are states. Actually, more was proved [2]: the  set of such criteria for all positive maps constitutes necessary and sufficient condition for separability. In this paper we will utilize the map (acting on matrices N × N ) [12] of the form (A) = ITrA - A. (2) where I is identity matrix. If A is positive then ITrA - A also does, hence  is a positive map. Writing the condition (1) explicitly for this particular map we obtain 2

1  I -   0

(3)

where 1 = Tr2  is a reduction of the state of interest. Thus to use the criterion, one should find the reduction 1 and check the eigenvalues of the operator 1  I - . Of course one can consider the dual criterion [9] I  2 -   0 (4)

As the two conditions relate the density matrix to its reductions (we will refer to them taken jointly as to reduction criterion) let us compare it with some other criteria built on this concept i.e. the ones exploiting the conditional quantum Ren´i  entropies [10] y S (1|2)  0, where S (1|2) = S () - S (2 ), S (2|1) = S () - S (1 ), (6) S (2|1)  0 (5)

1 S = 1- ln T r for 1 <  < , S1 is the von Neumann entropy and S = - ln  . The above inequalities are satisfied by separable states for  = 1, 2 and  [10,2]. The crucial difference is that they are scalar conditions being therefore considerably weaker than the present criterion which relates the structures of the density matrix and its reductions rather than scalar functions of them. This does not mean that the scalar criteria are useless. In fact, they can be used to characterize quantum channels: the von Neumann conditional entropy has been recently used for definition of quantum coherent information [11]. If however one is interested in characterization of separable (inseparable) states, the structural criteria are much more convenient. Nevertheless, it should be noted that for matrices with maximally mixed subsystems the reduction criterion reduces to -entropy inequality which can be written as   i , i = 1, 2. Now our goal is to distill the states which violate the condition (3). The first stage (filtering) [6] will be almost exactly the same as in the protocol given in [5]. For this purpose rewrite the condition (3) in the form

|1  I - |  0 or

for any

  C N  C N , |||| = 1,
P

(7)

TrP  Tr1 1 
P

(8)

where P = | | and 1  is reduced density matrix of P . Note that if we take P being maximally entangled states and maximize the left hand side over them, we will obtain the condition for singlet fraction (generalized to higher dimensions) [8,3] f ()  max T r(P ).


(9)

where the maximum is taken over all maximally entangled 's. Namely we then have: f ()  1 . N (10)

Suppose now that a state  violates the condition (8) for a certain vector | = amn em  en
1  ( N i ei

(11)  ei ) (where ei is an (12)

m,n

Now any such a vector can be produced from the generalized triplet state + = orthonormal basis in C N ) in the following way | = V  I|+

where em |V |en =

 P N amn . It can be checked that V V  = N 1  . Then a new state = ~ V   IV  I TrV V   I 3 (13)

resulting from filtering  by means of one-side action V   IV  I satisfies Tr~P+ >  1 , N P+  |+ + |. (14)

Now the problem is how to distill states with the property (14). For this purpose we need to generalize the protocol [8] used for C 2  C 2 case. The first thing we need is the generalized twirling procedure which would leave the state P+ unchanged. This, however, cannot be application of random bilateral unitary transformation of the form U  U as there is no U U invariant pure state in higher dimensions (Werner has found all states invariant under such operation [13]). The suitable generalization we obtain applying randomly transformation U U  where the star denotes complex conjugation in the Schmidt decomposition basis for the state P+ (i.e. ei in our case). It can be shown (see Appendix) that for any  if TrP+ = F then U  U  U   U  d U = (1 - ) I + P+ N with  = N2 F - 1 N2 - 1 (15)

i.e. after twirling we obtain state  (which can be viewed as generalized Werner-Popescu [15]) with the same generalized singlet fraction as the initial state (here d U denotes uniform probability distribution on unitary group 1 U (N ) proportional to the Haar measure). The states  are inseparable if and only if F > N (see Appendix). Note 1 1 that the inequality F > N is here equivalent to  > N +1 . The presented family defines the N-dimensional -depolarising channel which completely randomizes the input state  with probability  while leaves it undisturbed with probability 1 - . Such a channel, in the case N = 2, is being extensively investigated at present [3,14]. As it will be shown, the corresponding family of states resulting from sending half of the state P+ through the (N, )-depolarising channel can be distilled by means of two way classical communication if and only if  > N1 . Then by using the results relating quantum capacities and distillable +1 entanglement [3] we obtain that the considered channel supplemented by two way classical channel has nonzero quantum capacity for this range of . This reproduces the known result  > 1 for N = 2 [3]. 3 Now to distill the considered states we need to generalize quantum XOR gate [16]. The N-dimensional counterpart of the latter we choose to be UXORN |k |l = |k |l  k (16)

where k  l = (k + l) mod N . The |k and |l states describe the source and target systems respectively. Now the protocol is analogous to that in Ref. [8]. 1. Two input pairs are twirled i.e. each of them is subjected to random bilateral rotation of type U  U  2. The pairs are subjected to the transformation UXORN  UXORN . 3. The target pair is measured in the basis ei  ej . 4. If the outcomes are equal the source pair is kept, otherwise it is discarded. If the outcomes were identical, then twirling the resulting source pair, we obtain it in state  where  satisfies equation  () =  (N (N + 1) - 2) + 2 (N + 1)(1 + (N - 1)2 ) (17)

The above function is increasing and continuous in whole range   ( N1 , 1). Hence, as in Ref. [8], the fraction +1 increases if the initial fraction was greater than 1/N . Then to obtain a nonzero asymptotic yield of distilled pure entanglement, one is to follow the above protocol to obtain some high fidelity F and then project locally the resulting state onto two-dimensional spaces. For F high enough the resulting states on 2 × 2 system can be distilled by e.g. breeding protocol (see [8]). If needed they can be converted again into states of type P+ using technique introduced in Ref. [7]. To summarize, given a large amount of pairs of particles in a state which violates the condition (3) (or (4)), one needs first to apply the filtering procedure given by operator V , and then subject the particle which passed the filter to the reccurence protocol described above. Hence any state violating the reduction condition is distillable. Now, in further investigation leading to the solution of the problem whether any inseparable state can be distilled it suffices to restrict to the states which satisfy the criterion. On the other hand we have determined limit for use 4

of a class of protocols i.e. the ones consisting of two steps: one side, noncollective filtering and the procedure which 1 cannot distill the states with generalized singlet fraction less than N . Indeed, if a state can be distilled by such a 1 protocol, then filtering must increase the fraction to the larger value than N , hence the state violates the criterion. It is worth to note that to prove that any state violating the reduction criterion can be distilled the main task was to distill inseparable U  U  invariant states. Consequently, to be able to distill all the states violating the partial transposition criterion one needs only to provide a protocol of distillation of the inseparable U  U invariant states (Werner states [13]). This combined with filtering will produce the desired result. Note that both the partial transposition and reduction criterion are equivalent for the 2 × 2 (and 2 × 3) case. Indeed the map (2) is in this case of the form (A) = (y Ay )T producing then equivalent criterion. This is a reflection of the fact that the family of the Werner states and  are identical (up to a product unitary transformation) for 2 × 2 systems. For higher dimensions the two families are distinct, and the Werner states do not violate the present criterion. Indeed they have maximally mixed reductions and the norm less than 1/N , hence the inequality (8) cannot be violated. There is now the problem of distillation of such states. Using Popescu result [17] most of them can be distilled, however some of them cannot be distilled by known methods. Thus the criterion is not stronger than partial transposition, but certainly it is not weaker. Although we are not able to provide here a suitable example, this can be inferred from some feature of the used positive map. Namely in higher dimension (more than 2 × 2, 2 × 3) the map is undecomposable i.e. cannot be written by means of CP maps and transposition [12]. Thus there must be a state the partial transposition of which is positive, which however violates the reduction criterion (see Appendix in Ref. [2]). There is a question whether there are inseparable states which satisfy both conditions. We have already checked that all known so far inseparable states with positive partial transposition [19] satisfy the present criterion hence their inseparability can not be distilled via considered method. The present criterion does not seem to be additive i. e. one can expect that it could be satisfied by the state and violated by its tensor multiplication. This advantage (which is certainly absent for the partial transposition criterion [4]) would then allow for filtering in collective tests entanglement which is impossible to filter acting on single pairs. Moreover this criterion could be exploited together with two-side filtering and it cannot be excluded that it might allow to distill states which do not violate it at the beginning. Then it is interesting to characterize the class of states which initially do not violate the criterion, but do it if subjected to a one-side filtering. Finally note that both the positive maps applied so far in investigations of separability have some physical sense. The transposition means changing the direction of time [20]. The present positive map if applied to a part of a compound system indicates a nonzero content of pure entanglement in the state of the system. Then we believe that further investigation of inseparability by means of positive maps could allow us not only to characterize the set of separable states, but also to reveal a possible physical meaning of maps which are positive but not completely positive.

Appendix.- Applying the method used by Werner [13] we derive here the family of U  U  invariant states. Let us consider the Hermitian operator A which we want to be U  U  invariant. Let us write its matrix elements in some product basis mn|A|pq  em  en |A|ep  eq . (18)

Imposing on A condition of U  U  invariance with unitary operations U taking some |m0 to -|m0 and leaving the other basis elements unchanged we obtain that the only nonzero elements are of type mn|A|mn , mn|A|nm and mm|A|nn . Taking into account, again, another set of unitary transformations, each of the latter multiplying some single basis element by imaginary unit i and leaving the the remaining elements unchanged we obtain immediately that all mn|A|nm , m = n elements must vanish. Considering now all two element permutations of basis elements we obtain that the set of nonvanishing matrix elements can be divided into three groups: mn|A|mn , m = n, mm|A|nn , m = n and mm|A|mm with all elements in each of group equal. Thus any U U  invariant Hermitian operator can be written as A = bB+cC +dD where: B = m=n |mn mn|, C = m=n |mm nn|, D = m |mm mm|. Hermiticity of A implies that parameters b, c, d should be real. One can introduce the real unitary transformation of ~ ~ type U1  U1 = (U2  IN -2 )  (U2  IN -2 ) with ~ U2 = cos sin -sin cos 5 (19)

acting on some two-dimensional subspace H1 of H and IN -2 being a projection on the space orthogonal to H1 . It can be easily shown that the operator D is not invariant under U1  U1 hence is not U  U  invariant. Thus parameter d appears to be linearly dependent on a and b. Demanding, in addition T r(A) = 1 we obtain that the set of Hermitian U  U  invariant operators with unit trace are described by one real linear parameter. On the other hand it can be I checked immediately that the family  = (1 - ) N 2 + P+ fulfils the above criteria. Indeed identity is obviously  U  U invariant and for P+ we obtain : U  U  P+ U   U  = I  U T U  P+ I  (U T U  ) = P+ (20)

where the property [21] A  I+ = I  AT + has been used. Imposing now the positivity condition as we are interested in U  U  invariant states we obtain the family  ,   [ N-1 , 1]. It can be parametrized by fidelity F: 2 -1 (F )  F = N2 N2 - 1 (F - 1) I 1 + (F - 2 )P+ , N2 N 0  F  1. (21)

corresponding to the vectors  = |0 ,  = a|0 + b|1 with F = 1 only if F > N .

1 The above states are inseparable for fidelity greater then N as they violate the criterion (3). As F is U  U  invariant 1 parameter we obtain that for F  N the states can be reproduced by twirling of the product pure state P  P | | |2 . N

Thus the states (21) are inseparable if and

I. INTRODUCTION

Quatum entanglement [1] appears to be one of the most astonishing quantum phenomena. The new possibilities of applications of the extremely strong quantum correlations exhibiting by entangled states are being still discovered [2­6]. Some of the theoretically predicted effects like teleportation [4] or quantum dense coding [3] have been already realized experimentally [7,8]. Most of those effects involves the paradigmatic entangled state which is the singlet state of pair of spin- 1 particles [9] 2 1 s =  (|  |  - |  |  ) 2 (1)

This state cannot be reduced to direct product by any transformation of the bases pertaining to each one of the particles. Unfortunately, in practice we do not have singlet states in laboratory as they evolve to mixed states due to uncontrolled interaction with environment. However, the resulting mixtures may still contain some residual entanglement. To be able to benefit the entanglement we must bring it to the singlet form by means of local quantum (LQ) operations and classical communication (CC) between the parties (typically Alice and Bob) sharing the pairs in mixed state [10]. Such process is called purification of entanglement or distillation. Now, the fundamental question is I. Which mixed states can be distilled? To attempt to answer this question note that the notion of entanglement can be naturally extended into mixed states [11]. Namely we say that a mixed state AB acting on a Hilbert space H = HA  HB is inseparable (or entangled) if it cannot be written in the form [12] =
i

p i i  i . B A

(2)

If instead, the state can be written in this way, we call it separable (disentangled). Now, it is obvious that separable states cannot be distilled. Indeed, LQ+CC operations cannot bring the separable state into inseparable one, so that the final product cannot be the singlet state which is manifestly inseparable. Then we may ask the following question II. Can any inseparable state be distilled? To answer this question, two kinds of effort had to be made. First, given a density matrix, one did not have a way to check whether it is separable or not. In other words, there was a problem of operational characterization of separable (inseparable) states. The first attempt to solve the problem was seeking necessary conditions [13] of separability such as criterion of violating of Bell's inequalities [14] (as one knows, the separable states do not violate the inequalities), or the set of entropic inequalities [15­17]. The very important step is due to Peres [18] who noted that separable 1

states if partially transposed remain positive. Then by applying the machinery of positive maps formalism the Peres condition has been shown [19] to be equivalent to separability for 2 × 2 and 3 × 2 [20] systems. For higher dimensions explicit examples of inseparable states which do not violate Peres condition have been constructed in Ref. [21]. To answer the question II, apart from the problem of characterization of inseparable states, one needed to investigate the protocols of distillation. The original method of distillation introduced by Bennett et al. [10] for 2 × 2 systems (two-qubit ones) allows to distill a state if and only if its fully entangled fraction f is greater than 1 . The quantity f 2 is defined as f = sup || ,


(3)

where the supremum is taken over all vectors  which are of the form UA  UB s , where UA , UB are unitary transformations and s is given by eq. (1). Another method was local filtering considered by Gisin [22]. He noted that some states that initially did not violate Bell's inequalities would do it if subjected to local filtering [22]. This method does not lead to production of singlet states from mixed ones. It was also considered by Bennett et al. [23] in the context of converting pure non-maximally entangled states into singlet ones (they call it Procrustean method). In Ref. [24] the two protocols were put together and, by use of the mentioned characterization of the inseparable 2 × 2 systems, it was shown that the question II has positive answer in the case of those systems. The result can be easily extended to cover the 3 × 2 systems. Now one could expect that all the inseparable states can be distilled and the proof of that would be only question of time. Quite unexpectedly, a recent result [25] showed that it is not so. Namely, it turned out that the states which do not violate the Peres criterion cannot be distilled. Then, according to Ref. [21] there are examples of mixed states the entanglement of which cannot be brought to the singlet form! Consequently, the answer to the question II is negative, and we should reformulate it as follows III. Can all the states violating Peres condition be distilled? The answer to this question is at present unknown. The purpose of the present paper is to contribute to solution of the problem. We introduce separability condition based on some positive map. The condition is equivalent to separability for 2 × 2 (and 2 × 3) systems. Moreover, it has the property that any state (on an arbitrary N × N system i. e. consisted of two N-level systems) which violates it, can be effectively distilled by the suitable generalization of the protocol given in Ref. [24]. The converse also holds: the only states which can be distilled by such a kind of protocols, necessarily violate the criterion. Thus we obtain limits of the use of the considered class of protocols. One of the essential steps is determining the family of the states which are invariant product unitary transformation of the form U  U  where the star denotes complex conjugation. The family is connected with the natural generalization of the quantum depolarizing channel to higher dimensions. We believe that the states violating the reduction criterion have analogous properties to the inseparable two-qubit states, so that many distillation methods introduced in the two-qubit case, if suitably generalized, will work for the considered states. In contrast, the inseparable states satisfying the reduction criterion are supposed to exhibit oddities that do not occur in the two-qubit case. This paper is organized in the following way. In sec. II we outline the method of investigation of inseparability by means of positive maps. In sec. III we present a separability criterion based on some positive map. In particular, we show that it constitutes the necessary and sufficient condition for separability for 2 × 2 and 2 × 3 systems and is weaker than the Peres criterion for higher dimensions. In sec. IV we discuss it in the context of the entropic criteria relating the density matrix of the system to its reductions. In sec. V we derive the family of the states which are invariant under random action of U  U  transformations. The family is connected with the depolarizing channel generalized to higher dimensions. Subsequently, in sec. VI, we utilize the results of the previous section to show that any state violating the introduced reduction criterion can be distilled to the singlet form. It is done via generalized XOR operation and U  U  twirling. We also point out that the criterion determines the scope of use of a class of distillation protocols, namely the ones consisting of two steps: one-side, single-pair filtering and the procedure which 1 cannot distill the states with fully entangled fraction less than N . In section VII we illustrate the results by means of some examples.
II. POSITIVE MAPS, COMPLETELY POSITIVE MAPS AND INSEPARABILITY

In quantum formalism the state of physical system is represented by density matrix, i.e., positive operator of unit trace. Positivity means that the matrix is Hermitian and all its eigenvalues are nonnegative (if an operator  is positive we write   0). This assures that diagonal elements of density matrix written in any basis are nonnegative hence can be interpreted as probabilities of events. Thus to describe the change of state due to physical process, we certainly need a (linear) map which preserve positivity of operators (i.e. which maps positive operators onto positive ones) 2

  0  ()  0.

(4)

Such maps are called positive ones. However, it has been recognized [26] that the above condition is not sufficient for a given map to describe a physical process. To see it imagine that we have two systems A and B in some joint state AB . Suppose the systems are spatially separated, so that each one evolves separately and the evolution of the subsystems is given by A and B . Then the total evolution is described by the map  = A  B . Of course the operator out = (AB ) describing the state after evolution must be still positive. It leads us to another, very strong condition: the tensor multiplication of the maps describing the physical processes must be still positive map. The latter condition is called complete positivity. In fact it appears that for a given map  it suffices to have that   IN is a positive map for each natural N , where IN : MN  MN denotes identity map acting on matrices N × N (i.e. the matrices with N rows and N columns). This serves for definition of completely positive (CP) map [26]. For finite-dimensional systems even weaker condition is sufficient (see Appendix). Finally, one can distinguish an important subfamily of the CP maps which preserve trace i.e. for which Tr() = Tr. In contrast with such a general and slightly abstract approach, one can start by realizing what basic processes are allowed by quantum formalism. There are the following ones (ii)   U U  (unitary transformation) (i)      (adding a system in state  )

One can argue that any map describing physical process should allow to be written by means of the above three maps [26]. In fact, it appears that comparison of the two approaches leads to the satisfactory result: any trace-preserving CP map can be composed of the above maps and, of course, all the three maps are trace-preserving CP ones. If we supplement the three basic processes with the selection after measurement, then we obtain the family of all CP maps. Thus in the quantum formalism the most general physical process the quantum state can undergo is described by CP map. In result, the structure of the family of the CP maps has been extensively investigated [27,26] and is at present well known. However, one knows that there exist positive maps which are not CP ones. A common example is time reversal operator which acts as transposition of matrix in a given basis (T )ij = ji (5)
1 To see that it is not CP, hence cannot describe a physical process [28,29], consider a two spin- 2 system in the singlet state given by (1) and suppose that one of the subsystems is subjected to transposition while the other one does not evolve. Then it is easy to see that the resulting operator A = (I  T )(|s s |) is not positive hence cannot describe the state of physical system any longer. The time reversal is a common example of the positive map which is not CP, however, one knows only a few other examples of such maps. Indeed, since the latter are of little physical interest, their structure has not been extensively investigated and remains still obscure. However, recently we realized that they can be a powerful tool in investigation of quantum inseparability of mixed states [19]. To see it, let us discuss in more detail the considerable fault of the positive not-CP maps. The fault is that there are states of compound systems (as the singlet state) which are mapped by I   onto operators which are not positive. The basic question is what features of the "bad" states cause the troubles? To answer the question, recall that the singlet state is entangled since it cannot be written as product of two state vectors describing the subsystems. As mentioned in the introduction, the notion of entanglement extends naturally to cover mixed states (see formula (2)). Now, let us note that there is no trouble with positive not-CP maps as long as we deal with separable states. Indeed, in this case, if one of the systems is subjected by the positive map then the resulting operator remains positive

as (B )  0 due to positivity of . Thus if a positive map is not CP, this can be only recognized by means of i inseparable states. In other words, it is just inseparability which forced one to remove some positive maps from the family of the maps corresponding the physical processes. This suggests that the positive maps can be a particularly useful tool for investigation of inseparability. Indeed, a theorem has been proved [19] stating that any state is inseparable if and only if there exists a positive map such that (  I)() is not positive. In particular, if we have a positive map which is not CP then it automatically provides a necessary condition of separability which can be written as (I  )()  0 (7)

~ For a given map , the map I   will be further denoted by . 3

III. REDUCTION CRITERION OF SEPARABILITY

In this section we will utilize the map (acting on matrices N × N ) of the form [30] () = ITr - , (8)

where I is identity matrix. It is easy to see that if  is positive then ITr -  also does, hence  is a positive map. Writing the condition (7) explicitly for this particular map we obtain [31] A  I -   0, (9)

where A = TrB  is a reduction of the state of interest. Thus to use the criterion, one should find the reduction A and check the eigenvalues of the operator A  I - . Of course one can consider the dual criterion I  B -   0. (10)

As the two conditions relate the density matrix to its reductions we will refer to them taken jointly as to reduction criterion. Let us now consider shortly the reduction criterion in the context of the Peres one [18], which writes explicitly TB  0. (11)

TB Here TB |en  f = m,nµ and {ei  fj }ij is any product basis. It is easy to see that both the mµ,n  em  fµ | criteria are equivalent for the 2 × 2 (and 2 × 3) case. Indeed, the map (8) is in this case of the form (A) = (y Ay )T producing then equivalent criterion. For higher dimensions, the map (8) can be composed with transposition and a completely positive map (see Appendix). Hence, according to [19], if any state violates the criterion (9) then it must also violate the Peres criterion ~ [32]. Indeed, suppose that  satisfies the latter. Then we have   T   0, hence also for any CP map CP ~ CP () is positive. Consequently, if a positive, but not CP map  can be written as  = CP T (or the operator  ~ equivalently  = T CP , see Appendix) and a state satisfies Peres criterion, then it also satisfies the criterion   0 constituted by . Thus we see, that the reduction criterion is not stronger than the Peres one. On the other hand, there exist states which satisfy the reduction criterion but violate the Peres one. These are the Werner states [12] WN of N × N system given by

WN = (N 3 - N )-1 {(N - )I + (N  - 1)V }

(12)

where -1    1 and V is defined as V    =   . The states are inseparable for  < 0. For 2 × 2 system the ~ ~ Werner states take a simple form [33] I W2 = (1 - ) + |s s |, 4 - 1    1. 3 (13)

being mixtures of maximally chaotic state and the singlet state. It can be seen that all for N  3 inseparable Werner states violate partial transposition criterion satisfying the reduction one. Indeed they have maximally mixed reductions and the norm less than 1/N , hence the inequality (9) cannot be violated (explicitly the reduction criterion for Werner states writes as 2 - N    N which is satisfied for N  3) The family of the Werner states has an interesting property, namely they are the only states invariant under any transformation of the form   U  U U   U  , (14)

where U is a unitary transformation (we say they are U  U invariant). As we will see further, our criterion will lead in a natural way to distinguishing another family of states which are invariant under any transformation of the form   U  U  U   U  . (15)

where the star denotes complex conjugation of matrix elements of U (analogously we will call such states U  U  invariant). As it will be seen, the two families are identical (up to a local unitary transformation) for two-qubit case, but become distinct for higher dimensions.

4

To summarise, in higher dimension the reduction criterion is weaker than Peres one. The advantage of the present criterion is the fact that, as it will be shown, all the states violating it can be distilled. The latter result is compatible with [25] where it is shown that the states which can be distilled must violate the Peres criterion. Finally, there is a question whether one could obtain stronger criterion by applying the present one to a collection   · · ·   rather than to state  of single pair (we will call it collective application of the criterion). To answer the question it is convenient to introduce the following notation. If N parties share a number of M N-tuples of particles, each one in state M then the joint state 1  · · ·  M we will denote by   1  2     ·  (16)    ·   ·  M Consider first the Peres condition and apply it collectively. One can check that [18] ~ T 1 2 = ~ T (1 ) ~ T (2 ) . (17)

Hence, if the state    violates the criterion then also  does, so that the collective application of Peres criterion does not produce a stronger one. Rains has proved [34] that also in the case of the reduction criterion if the state 1  2 of two pairs violates it then the state of each pair separately also does. Indeed, denoting the partial traces of states 1 and 2 over the systems B by 1 and 2 respectively, one obtains ~  hence ~ (1 ) ~ (2 ) ~ = 1 2 = +2 I  1 - 1 I  2 - 2 1 2 - = 1 I  2 I  1 I  2 - + 1 2 . - 1 I  2 - I  1 2 = (19) (20) 1 2 = I  1 I  2 - 1 2 (18)

I  1 2

This can be rewritten as ~  Thus we have obtained that ~ ~ ~ (1 )  0 and (2 )  0   which is the desired result.

Now it is interesting to discuss the criterion in the context of entropic criteria which also exploit the relation between the total system and its subsystems. The first necessary condition of separability of this type was constructed by means of von Neumann entropies of the system and subsystems [15]. The entropic criteria were then generalized by using the quantum S Ren´i entropies [16]. They base on the following inequalities for conditional entropies [16,17] y S (A|B)  0, with 5 S (B|A)  0 (23)

S (A|B) = S () - S (B ), where S = 1 ln T r 1-

S (B|A) = S () - S (A ),

(24)

for

1 <  < ,

(25)

S1 is the von Neumann entropy and S = - ln  . It has been shown [15,16,19] that the above inequalities are satisfied by separable states for  = 1, 2 and . The crucial difference is that they are scalar conditions being therefore weaker than the present criterion which relates the structures of the density matrix and its reductions rather than scalar functions of them. This does not mean that the scalar criteria are useless. In fact, they can be useful for characterization of quantum channels. In particular, the von Neumann conditional entropy has been recently used for definition of quantum coherent information [35]. If, however, one is interested in characterization of separable (inseparable) states, the structural criteria are much more convenient. In particular, note that the reduction criterion is stronger than the  entropy inequality. The latter criterion says in fact that for a separable state the largest eigenvalue of the density matrix of the total system cannot exceed the one of any of the reduced density matrices   max ()  max (X )  X , X = A, B. (26)

To see that this is implied by the conditions (9), (10), suppose that they are satisfied i.e.   X  I for X=A,B. Note that if 0  1  2 then we have also 0  1  2 . Consequently, since  is positive and X = I  X , we immediately obtain that     I = X . For states with maximally disordered subsystems the reduction criterion is equivalent to the  entropy inequality. Indeed, in this case the smallest eigenvalue of the operator 1 X  I -  is equal to  = N -  = X -  , hence both the criteria are satisfied or violated simultaneously. Finally, the reduction criterion is essentially stronger than the  entropy inequalities, as the latter are not sufficient for separability for two-qubit systems [19] while the reduction criterion does, as shown above.
V. U  U  -INVARIANT STATES.

In this section, applying the method used by Werner [12] we derive the family of U  U  invariant states i.e. the ones invariant under transformation of the form   U  U  U   U  (here U is unitary transformation and U  its complex conjugation). Let us consider the Hermitian operator A which we want to be U  U  invariant. Let us write its matrix elements in a product basis mn|A|pq  em  en |A|ep  eq . (27)

Imposing on A condition of U  U  invariance with unitary operations U taking some |m0 to -|m0 and leaving the other basis elements unchanged we obtain that the only nonzero elements are of type mn|A|mn , mn|A|nm and mm|A|nn . Taking into account, again, another set of unitary transformations, each of the latter multiplying some single basis element by imaginary unit i and leaving the the remaining elements unchanged we obtain immediately that all mn|A|nm , m = n elements must vanish. Considering now all two element permutations of basis elements we obtain that the set of nonvanishing matrix elements can be divided into three groups: mn|A|mn , m = n, mm|A|nn , m = n and mm|A|mm with all elements in each of group equal. Thus any U U  invariant Hermitian operator can be written as A = bB+cC +dD where: B = m=n |mn mn|, C = m=n |mm nn|, D = m |mm mm|. Hermiticity of A implies that parameters b, c, d should be real. One can introduce the real unitary transformation of ~ ~ type U1  U1 = (U2  IN -2 )  (U2  IN -2 ) with ~ U2 = cos sin -sin cos (28)

acting on some two-dimensional subspace H1 of H and IN -2 being a projection on the space orthogonal to H1 . It can be easily shown that the operator D is not invariant under U1  U1 hence is not U  U  invariant. Thus parameter d appears to be linearly dependent on a and b. Demanding, in addition Tr(A) = 1 we obtain that the set of Hermitian U  U  invariant operators with unit trace are described by one real linear parameter. On the other hand it can be checked immediately that the family  = (1 - ) I + P+ N2 6 (29)

fulfils the above criteria. Here P+ = |+ + | with 1 + =  N

(30)

is the generalized triplet state. Indeed, the identity operator is obviously U  U  invariant and for P+ we obtain U  U  P+ U   U  = I  U T U  P+ I  (U T U  ) = P+ (31) where the property [36] A  I+ = I  AT + was used. Imposing now the positivity condition, as we are interested in U  U  invariant states, we obtain the family  = (1 - ) I + P+ , N2 with -1 1 N2 - 1 (32)

Note that  can be viewed as Werner-Popescu state (13) (mixture of singlet state and maximally chaotic state) suitably generalized to higher dimensions. The family can be parametrized by fidelity F = TrP+ (F )  F = N2 N2 - 1 (F - 1) I 1 + (F - 2 )P+ , 2 N N 0  F  1. (33)

1 The above states are inseparable for fidelity greater than N as they violate the criterion (9). As F is U  U  invariant 1 parameter we obtain that for F  N (resp.   N1 ) the states can be reproduced by twirling i. e. random U  U  +1 operation represented by the integral

U  U  (·)U   U   dU

(34)

performed on the proper product pure state (here d U denotes uniform probability distribution on unitary group U (N ) proportional to the Haar measure). This can be the state P P corresponding to the vectors  = |1 ,  = a|1 +b|2  2 1 with F = | | | . Thus the states (33) (resp. 32) are inseparable if and only if F > N ( > N1 ). N +1 The presented family defines the N-dimensional -depolarizing channel which completely randomises the input state  with probability  while leaves it undisturbed with probability 1 - . Such a channel, in the case N = 2, is being extensively investigated at present [5,37]. As it will be shown, the corresponding family of states (32) resulting from sending half of the state P+ through the (N, )-depolarizing channel can be distilled by means of LQ+CC operations 1 if and only if F > N ( > N1 ). Then by using the results relating quantum capacities and distillable entanglement +1 [5] we obtain that the considered channel supplemented by two way classical channel has nonzero quantum capacity for this range of . This reproduces the known result F > 1 ( > 1 ) for N = 2 [5]. 2 3
VI. DISTILLATION PROTOCOL

Now our goal is to distill the states which violate the condition (9). The first stage (filtering) [22] will be almost exactly the same as in the protocol given in [24]. For this purpose rewrite the condition (9) in the form |A  I - |  0 for any or TrP  TrA  A (36)   C N  C N , |||| = 1, (35)

where P = | | and  is reduced density matrix of P . Note that if we take P being maximally entangled states A and maximize the left hand side over them, we will obtain the condition for fully entangled fraction [10,5] (generalized to higher dimensions) f ()  max T r(P ).


(37)

where the maximum is taken over all maximally entangled 's. Namely we then have 7

f () 

1 N

(38)

for any separable . Suppose now that a state  violates the condition (36) for a certain vector | = amn |m  |n (39)

m,n

Now, any such a vector can be produced from the triplet state + given by (30) in the following way | = A  I|+ Namn . It can be checked that AA = N  . Then, the new state A  = A  IA  I Tr(AA  I) 1 , N (41) (40)

where m|A|n =



resulting from filtering  by means of one-side action A  IA  I satisfies Tr P+ > (42)

Now, the problem is how to distill states with the property (42). For this purpose we need to generalize the protocol [10] used for two-qubit case. The first thing we need is the generalized twirling procedure which would leave the state P+ unchanged. This, however, cannot be application of random bilateral unitary transformation of the form U  U as there is no U  U invariant pure state in higher dimensions (this can be seen directly from the form of the Werner states (12)) As we have shown in sec. V the suitable generalization we obtain applying randomly transformation U  U  where the star denotes complex conjugation in any basis (e.g. in the basis |i ). From the results of the previous section it follows that for any  if TrP+ = F then U  U  U   U  d U =   (1 - ) I + P+ N with  = N2 F - 1 , 0F1 N2 - 1 (43)

i.e. after twirling we obtain state  with the same fidelity F as the initial state. As it was shown in previous section, 1 the states  are inseparable if and only if F > N . Now, to distill the considered states we need to generalize quantum XOR gate [38]. The N-dimensional counterpart of the latter we choose to be UXORN |k |l = |k |l  k (44)

where k  l = (k + l) mod N . The |k and |l states describe the source and target systems respectively. Now the protocol is analogous to that in Ref. [10]. 1. Two input pairs are twirled i.e. each of them is subjected to random bilateral rotation of type U  U  2. The pairs are subjected to the transformation UXORN  UXORN . 3. The target pair is measured in the basis |i  |j . 4. If the outcomes are equal, the source pair is kept, otherwise it is discarded. If the outcomes were identical, then twirling the resulting source pair, we obtain it in state  where  satisfies equation  () =  (N (N + 1) - 2) + 2 (N + 1)(1 + (N - 1)2 ) (45)

The above function is increasing and continuous in total range   ( N1 , 1). Hence, as in Ref. [10], the fraction +1 increases if the initial fraction was greater than 1/N . Then to obtain a nonzero asymptotic yield of distilled pure entanglement, one is to follow the above protocol to obtain some high fidelity F and then project locally the resulting state onto two-dimensional spaces. For F high enough the resulting states on 2 × 2 system can be distilled by e.g. 8

 1 with F  > N by means of separable superoperators [40,39] which are defined as () = i Ai  Bi A  Bi . Indeed, i 1 1 if a two spin­ 2 Bell diagonal state B has F  2 then it is separable state [5,17]. On the other hand, any state of 1 1 N × N system, say N , with F > N is inseparable as it can be U  U  twirled to the state (33) with F > N which we have shown to be inseparable. But no separable state (in particular the one  B constructed from separable states K

breeding protocol (see [10]). If needed they can be converted again into states of type P+ using technique introduced in Ref. [23]. To summarize, given a large amount of pairs of particles in a state which violates the condition (9) (or (10)), one needs first to apply the filtering procedure given by operator A, and then subject the particle which passed the filter to the recurrence protocol described above. Note that the operator A, if is to describe the process of filtering (or a part of generalized measurement), should be properly normalized, so that A  1. Note that the present results allow for simple, independent proof of the fact [39] that the tensor product of K pairs 1 1 of two spin­ 2 Bell diagonal states  B , each with fidelity F  2 can not be transformed into a state of N × N system

B ) can not be transformed by separable operations into the inseparable state N .
VII. EXAMPLES

Here we will illustrate the criterion and the first stage of our distillation protocol. For this purpose consider the following unitary embedding the Hilbert space C N into C N  C N [41] |i  |i  |i (46) By means of this transformation we can ascribe to any state N on C N a state N e acting on C N  C N . For example if N = 3 and N is given by   11 12 13 N =  21 22 23  (47) 31 32 33 then  11 0 0 0 21 0 0 0 31 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 22 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 32 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 13 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 23 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 33              (48)

N e

The reductions of N e are both equal to the state N with off-diagonal terms different from zero. That the state N e is inseparable if and only if N is not diagonal can be viewed in different ways. First, the state N e with some off-diagonal elements different from zero violates the  entropy inequality as N e = N > maxj {jj } = N e , X where X = A or B (of course if N is diagonal then eN is trivially separable). On the other hand, we can apply the Peres criterion. However, the two criteria do not say whether and how the state can be distilled. Then let us apply the reduction criterion. Here (e.g. for N = 3) we have   0 0 0 0 -12 0 0 0 -13  0 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 11 0 0 0 0 0 0    0 0 22 0 0 0 0 0   0   0 0 0 0 -23  (49) N e  I - N e =  -21 0 0 0 A  0 0 0 0 0 22 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 33 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 33 0  -31 0 0 0 -32 0 0 0 0 9

      =     

Hence, if only the state N e is inseparable then it violates the criterion. Then we can apply the distillation criterion calculating the eigenvector corresponding the suitable negative eigenvalue, subjecting the state to the appropriate filter and performing then the recurrence protocol. However, it can be checked that for N = 3 this state has already 1 the fidelity greater than 3 , hence it can be distilled without the filtering step. 3 Consider now the second, more explicit example. Let P+ denote the triplet state (30) with N=3 and let Pij = |i i|  |j j|
3  = pP+ + (1 - p)P12 , p 

1 . 3

(50)

1 It can be proved that fully entangled fraction f of this state is not greater then 3 . For this purpose consider the N overlap of the UA  UB transformation of the state P+ with an arbitrary pure state P ,  = i,j=1 aij |i |j . We obtain that      T r(P UA  UB P+ UA  UB ) = T r(P I  UB UA P+ UA UB ) = |T r(A UB UA )|2 , (51)  where as in sec. VI the matrix elements of A are {A }ij = N aij . Straightforward computation analogous to the one performed in Ref. [42] leads us to the following formula on fully entangled fraction of pure state 

f (P ) = [T r( (A A )]2 = 

1 ci )2 ( N i=1

N

(52)

where ci are Schmidt decomposition (hence positive) coefficients of the state . From the above formula it follows 1 that in our case the fully entangled fraction of product pure state can not be greater than 3 . As we assumed that the probability p is also not greater than this number we obtain immediately that fully entangled fraction of the state satisfies f ()  1 . Now we can apply the prescription given in section V. According to (50) we have the matrix 3 A  I -  of the form   1-p 0 0 0 -p 0 0 0 -p 3 3 p  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  3    0 0 1 + 2p 0 0 0 0 0 0  3   p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 3  p p  0 0 0 0 0 0 -3  A  I -  =  - 3 0 (53)  0 0 0 0 0 p 0 0 0    3  0 0 0 0 0 0 p 0 0    3  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 p 0  3 -p 0 0 0 -p 0 0 0 0 3 3
1 4 This matrix has negative eigenvalue  = 2 (1 - 3 p - 4 1 - 4 p + 3 p2 ) with the corresponding eigenvector 3

1 1 + 2y 2

(|1 |1 + y|2 |2 + y|3 |3 ), y =

1 (3 - 10p + 3 4p

4 4 1 - p + p2 ). 3 3

(54)

According to the section V, in order to distill some entanglement from the state we can apply the local filter   1 0 0 3  0 y 0 . A= 1 + 2y 2 0 0 y Then we obtain the new state  = 3(1 - p) 1 + 2y 2 (pP+ + P12 ) = p P+ + (1 - p )P12 . 3 - 2p + 2py 2 1 + 2y 2

(55)

(56)

From the previous results we know that the new state must have fidelity greater than 1 . To see it in this particular 3 p 1 case it suffices only to show that (1-p ) > 2 . This inequality can be transformed to the form : 4 4 3 - 14p + 22p2 + (3 - 10p) 1 - p + p2 > 0 3 3 10 (57)

1 Using the fact that p  3 , the last term in this formula can be estimated from below by 1 . This leads to the 3 inequality which can be checked directly. Thus in the process of filtering the input state with the fidelity less than 1 1 3 has been transformed into the state with F strictly greater than 3 . Then the protocol using generalised XOR operations described in section V can be applied. Note that the result of the procedure is independent of the choice of normalisation of the filter. Thus we can choose the best possible normalisation multiplying the matrix (55) by the constant to transform the largest number of diagonal elements into identities. It results in optimal filter   1+2y 2 0 0 3y   (58) A= 0 1 0 . 0 0 1

Then the probability of successful outcome (after which we can perform the XOR step) is q =
VIII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

3-2p+2py 2 . 3y

We have introduced a separability criterion relating the structures of total state of the system and its reductions. The criterion (called reduction one) has been generated by means of some positive map. Subsequently, we have shown that any state violating the reduction criterion is distillable. Now, in further investigation leading to the solution of the problem whether any state violating Peres condition can be distilled it suffices to restrict to the states which satisfy the criterion. On the other hand we have determined limit for use of a class of protocols i.e. the ones consisting of two steps: one-side, single-pair filtering and any procedure which can only distill the states with fully entangled 1 fraction greater than N . Indeed, if a state can be distilled by such a protocol, then filtering must increase the fraction 1 to the larger value than N , hence the state violates the criterion. It is worth to note that to prove that any state violating the reduction criterion can be distilled the main task was to distill inseparable U  U  invariant states. In a similar way it can be shown that to be able to distill all the states violating the partial transposition criterion one needs only to provide a protocol of distillation of the inseparable U  U invariant states (Werner states [12]). This combined with filtering will produce the desired result. Up till now, we know how to distill only part of the Werner states (this can be achieved by using Popescu result [44]), however the other part cannot be distilled by known methods. The present criterion may be exploited together with two-side filtering and it cannot be excluded that it might allow to distill states which do not violate it at the beginning. Then it is interesting to characterize the class of states which initially do not violate the criterion, but do it if subjected to a one-side filtering. It is remarkable, that all the states violating the criterion, or violating it after local transformations are nonlocal, which follows from consideration of the distillation process in the context of sequential hidden variable model [43]. The reduction criterion divides the set of inseparable states into two classes of states: the ones that violate it and the ones that satisfy it. It seems that the former ones possess analogous properties to the inseparable two-qubit states. In particular, there is a hope that methods which have been successfully applied to the two-qubit states (or one-qubit quantum channels) like e.g. weight enumerator techniques [45,39] will also work well for states violating the reduction criterion (or corresponding noisy channels). Then the latter states could be called two-qubit-like states. In contrast, the inseparable states satisfying the criterion are supposed to exhibit features which never occur in the two-qubit case. Then, to deal with these states, completely new methods must be worked out. An example of such states are Werner states, for which no direct generalization of two-qubit methods leads to distillation. Finally, note that both the positive maps applied so far in investigations of separability have some physical sense. The transposition means changing the direction of time [28]. The present positive map if applied to a part of a compound system indicates a nonzero content of pure entanglement in the state of the system. Then we believe that further investigation of inseparability by means of positive maps could allow us not only to characterize the set of separable states, but also to reveal a possible physical meaning of maps which are positive but not completely positive. We are indebted to A. Kossakowski and A. Uhlmann for discussion on positive maps, R. Horodecki for many helpful comments and E. Rains for allowing us to incorporate his proof concerning collective application of reduction criterion and for helpful comments. We are also grateful to N. J. Cerf and R. M.

APPENDIX A:

Here we will prove that the positive map  given by eq. (8) is decomposable i.e. it can be written in the form [29]  = CP + T CP , 1 2 (A1)

where CP are CP maps and T is transposition. In fact, we will see that the map is trivially decomposable i.e. it is i of the form  = T CP . To prove the above we need the lemma establishing one-to-one correspondence between CP maps  : MN  MN and positive matrices (operators) belonging to tensor product MN  MN (this is analogous to the fact that positive maps are equivalent to the matrices in MN  MN which are positive on product vectors [46,19]). Lemma. A linear map  : MN  MN is completely positive if and only if the operator D  MN  MN given by D = (I  )P+ (A2) is positive (here P+ is given by eq. (30)). Proof. If  is CP then by the very definition of the CP map, the operator D is positive. Conversely, suppose that the operator D is positive. Then it can be written by means of its spectral decomposition D=
i

i |i i |

(A3)

with nonnegative eigenvalues i . Taking Vi such that I  Vi |+ = |i (see sec. VI), we obtain D=
i

i I  Vi P+ I  Vi

(A4)

Comparing this formula with eq. (A2) and noting that  is uniquely determined by this equation, we obtain that it is given by () =
i

Wi Wi

(A5)

 where Wi = i Vi . However this is the general form of completely positive maps [27]. This ends the proof of the lemma. Remark. The lemma also holds for  : MN  MK with N = K. Then the P+ belongs to MN  MN and the operator D belongs to MN  MK . Consider now the map of interest given by () = ITr - . The corresponding operator D (by eq. (9) is given by D = (P+ )A  I - P+ where (P+ )A is the reduction of the state P+ so that (P+ )A = can be checked that DTB is of the form DTB =
1 N I.

(A6) Consider now the partial transposition of B. It

1 (I  I - V ) N

(A7)

where V is the operator [12] defined by V    =    for any vectors ,   C N  C N . As V 2 = I  I we obtain that V has eigenvalues ±1 so that I  I - V is a positive operator. Thus we see that DTB is a positive operator. However we have DTB = (I  T )P+ . Then by the lemma the map  = T  is CP. Consequently, we obtain  = T (A8) which ends the proof. Of course,  can be also written as  =  T with completely positive  . Indeed, as  is CP, then it is of the form () = i Vi Vi . Hence T (()) =
i

(Vi Vi )T =
i

(ViT )  T ViT =

~ with Vi = (ViT ) . Thus  is completely positive.

Foundation, Villa Gualino, Viale Settimio Severo 65, 1033 Torino, Italy. 4 Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, 24-29 St. Giles', Oxford OX1 3LB, U.K. Quantum computers use the quantum interference of different computational paths to enhance correct outcomes and suppress erroneous outcomes of computations. A common pattern underpinning quantum algorithms can be identified when quantum computation is viewed as multi-particle interference. We use this approach to review (and improve) some of the existing quantum algorithms and to show how they are related to different instances of quantum phase estimation. We provide an explicit algorithm for generating any prescribed interference pattern with an arbitrary precision.

1. Introduction Quantum computation is based on two quantum phenomena: quantum interference and quantum entanglement. Entanglement allows one to encode data into non-trivial multi-particle superpositions of some preselected basis states, and quantum interference, which is a dynamical process, allows one to evolve initial quantum states (inputs) into final states (outputs) modifying intermediate multi-particle superpositions in some prescribed way. Multi-particle quantum interference, unlike single particle interference, does not have any classical analogue and can be viewed as an inherently quantum process. It is natural to think of quantum computations as multi-particle processes (just as classical computations are processes involving several "particles" or bits). It turns out that viewing quantum computation as multi-particle interferometry leads to a simple and a unifying picture of known quantum algorithms. In this language quantum computers are basically multi-particle interferometers with phase shifts that result from operations of some quantum logic gates. To illustrate this point, consider, for example, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (Fig. 1a). A particle, say a photon, impinges on a half-silvered mirror, and, with some probability amplitudes, propagates via two different paths to another half-silvered mirror which directs the particle to one of the two detectors. Along each path between the two half-silvered mirrors, is a phase shifter. If the lower path is labelled as state | 0 and the upper one as state | 1 then the state of the particle in between the half-silvered mirrors and after passing through the phase shifters

1 is a superposition of the type 2 (| 0 + ei(1 -0 ) | 1 ), where 0 and 1 are the settings of the two phase shifters. This is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The phase shifters in the two paths can be tuned to effect any prescribed relative phase shift  = 1 1 - 0 and to direct the particle with probabilities 1 (1 + cos ) and 2 (1 - cos ) 2 respectively to detectors "0" and "1". The second half-silvered mirror effectively erases all information about the path taken by the particle (path | 0 or path | 1 ) which is essential for observing quantum interference in the experiment.

Figure 1. (a) Scheme of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with two phase shifters. The interference pattern depends on the difference between the phase shifts in different arms of the interferometer. (b) The corresponding quantum network representation.

Let us now rephrase the experiment in terms of quantum logic gates. We identify the half-silvered mirrors with the single qubit Hadamard transform (H), defined as | 0 - | 1 -
H H 1  (| 0 2 1  (| 0 2

+ |1 ) - |1 ) . (1.1)

The Hadamard transform is a special case of the more general Fourier transform, which we shall consider in Sect. 4. We view the phase shifter as a single qubit gate. The resulting network corresponding to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is shown in Fig. 1b. The phase shift can be "computed" with the help of an auxiliary qubit (or a set of qubits) in a prescribed state | u and some controlled-U transformation where U | u = ei | u (see Fig. 2). Here the controlled-U means that the form of U depends on the logical value of the control qubit, for example we can apply the identity transformation to the auxiliary qubits (i.e. do nothing) when the control qubit is in

state | 0 and apply a prescribed U when the control qubit is in state | 1 . The controlled-U operation must be followed by a transformation which brings all computational paths together, like the second half-silvered mirror in the MachZehnder interferometer. This last step is essential to enable the interference of different computational paths to occur--for example, by applying a Hadamard transform. In our example, we can obtain the following sequence of transformations on the two qubits | 0 | u -

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section we discuss Deutsch's problem (1985) which shows how differentiation between interference patterns (different phase-shifts) can lead to the formulation of computational problems. Then, in Sect. 3, we review, in a unified way, generalisations of Deutsch's problem, and propose further ones. In Sect. 4 we discuss an alternative and convenient way to view the quantum Fourier transform. In Sect. 5 we propose an efficient method for phase estimation based on the quantum Fourier transform. In order to illustrate how some of the existing algorithms can be reformulated in terms of the multi-particle interferometry and the phase estimation problem, in Sect. 6 we rephrase Shor's order-finding algorithm (used to factor) using the phase estimation approach. Finally, in Sect. 7 we present a universal construction which generates any desired interference pattern with arbitrary accuracy. We summarise the conclusions in Sect. 8.

R. Cleve, A. Ekert, C. Macchiavello and M. Mosca 2. Deutsch's Problem

Since quantum phases in the interferometers can be introduced by some controlledU operations, it is natural to ask whether effecting these operations can be described as an interesting computational problem. In this section, we illustrate how interference patterns lead to computational problems that are well-suited to quantum computations, by presenting the first such problem that was proposed by David Deutsch (1985). To begin with, suppose that the phase shifter in the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is set either to  = 0 or to  = . Can we tell the difference? Of course we can. In fact, a single instance of the experiment determines the difference: for  = 0 the particle always ends up in the detector "0" and for  =  always in the detector "1". Deutsch's problem is related to this effect. Consider the Boolean functions f that map {0, 1} to {0, 1}. There are exactly four such functions: two constant functions (f (0) = f (1) = 0 and f (0) = f (1) = 1) and two "balanced" functions (f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1 and f (0) = 1, f (1) = 0). Informally, in Deutsch's problem, one is allowed to evaluate the function f only once and required to deduce from the result whether f is constant or balanced (in other words, whether the binary numbers f (0) and f (1) are the same or different). Note that we are not asked for the particular values f (0) and f (1) but for a global property of f . Classical intuition tells us that to determine this global property of f , we have to evaluate both f (0) and f (1) anyway, which involves evaluating f twice. We shall see that this is not so in the setting of quantum information, where we can solve Deutsch's problem with a single function evaluation, by employing an algorithm that has the same mathematical structure as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Let us formally define the operation of "evaluating" f in terms of the f controlled-NOT operation on two bits: the first contains the input value and the second contains the output value. If the second bit is initialised to 0, the f controlled-NOT maps (x, 0) to (x, f (x)). This is clearly just a formalization of the operation of computing f . In order to make the operation reversible, the mapping is defined for all initial settings of the two bits, taking (x, y) to (x, y  f (x)). Note that this operation is similar to the controlled-NOT (see, for example, Barenco et al. (1995)), except that the second bit is negated when f (x) = 1, rather than when x = 1. If one is only allowed to perform classically the f -controlled-NOT operation once, on any input from {0, 1}2 , then it is impossible to distinguish between balanced and constant functions in the following sense. Whatever the outcome, both possibilities (balanced and constant) remain for f . However, if quantum mechanical superpositions are allowed then a single evaluation of the f -controlledNOT suffices to classify f . Our quantum algorithm that accomplishes this is best represented as the quantum network shown in Fig. 3b, where the middle operation is the f -controlled-NOT, whose semantics in quantum mechanical notation are |x |y
f -c-N

- | x | y  f (x) .

(2.1)

The initial state of the qubits in the quantum network is | 0 (| 0 - | 1 ) (apart from a normalization factor, which will be omitted in the following). After the first Hadamard transform, the state of the two qubits has the form (| 0 + | 1 )(| 0 - | 1 ). To determine the effect of the f -controlled-NOT on this state, first note

| x (| 0 - | 1 ) - | x (| 0  f (x) - | 1  f (x) ) = (-1)f (x) | x (| 0 - | 1 ) . (2.2) Therefore, the state after the f -controlled-NOT is ((-1)f (0) | 0 + (-1)f (1) | 1 )(| 0 - | 1 ) . (-1)f (x) , (2.3) That is, for each x, the | x term acquires a phase factor of which corresponds to the eigenvalue of the state of the auxiliary qubit under the action of the operator that sends | y to | y  f (x) . This state can also be written as (-1)f (0) (| 0 + (-1)f (0)f (1) | 1 ) , which, after applying the second Hadamard transform, becomes (-1)f (0) | f (0)  f (1) . (2.5) Therefore, the first qubit is finally in state | 0 if the function f is constant and in state | 1 if the function is balanced, and a measurement of this qubit distinguishes these cases with certainty. This algorithm is an improved version of the first quantum algorithm for this problem proposed by Deutsch (1985), which accomplishes the following. There are three possible outcomes: "balanced", "constant", and "inconclusive". For any f , the algorithm has the property that: with probability 1 , it outputs "balanced" 2 or "constant" (correctly corresponding to f ); and, with probability 1 , it outputs 2 "inconclusive" (in which case no information is determined about f ). This is a task that no classical computation can accomplish (with a single evaluation of the f -controlled-NOT gate). In comparison, our algorithm can be described as always producing the output "balanced" or "constant" (correctly). Alain Tapp (1997) independently discovered an algorithm for Deutsch's problem that is similar to ours. (2.4)

Deutsch's result laid the foundation for the new field of quantum computation, and was followed by several other quantum algorithms for various problems, which all seem to rest on the same generic sequence: a Fourier transform, followed by an f -controlled-U , followed by another Fourier transform. (In some cases, such as Lov Grover's "database search" algorithm (1996), this sequence is a critical component to a larger algorithm; see Appendix B). We illustrate this point by reviewing several of these other algorithms in the sections that follow. 3. Generalisations of Deutsch's Problem Deutsch's original problem was subsequently generalised by Deutsch and Jozsa (1992) for Boolean functions f : {0, 1}n  {0, 1} in the following way. Assume that, for one of these functions, it is "promised" that it is either constant or balanced (i.e. has an equal number of 0's outputs as 1's), and consider the goal of determining which of the two properties the function actually has. How many evaluations of f are required to do this? Any classical algorithm for this problem would, in the worst-case, require 2n-1 + 1 evaluations of f before determining the answer with certainty. There is a quantum algorithm that solves this problem with a single evaluation of f . The algorithm is presented in Fig. 4, where the control register is now composed of n qubits, all initially in state | 0 ,

Figure 4. Network representation of Deutsch-Jozsa's and Bernstein-Vazirani's algorithms.

denoted as | 00 · · · 0 , and, as in the quantum algorithm for Deutsch's simple problem, an auxiliary qubit is employed, which is initially set to state | 0 - | 1 and is not altered during the computation. Also, the n-qubit Hadamard transform H is defined as | x -

(3.1)

for all x  {0, 1}n , where x · y = (x1  y1 )  · · ·  (xn  yn ) (3.2) (i.e. the scalar product modulo two). This is equivalent to performing a one-qubit Hadamard transform on each of the n qubits individually. The actual computation of the function f is by means of an f -controlled-NOT gate (the middle gate in Fig. 4), which acts as |x |y

(3.3)

Quantum Algorithms Revisited

This is similar to Eq. (2.1), except that now x  {0, 1}n . Stepping through the execution of the network, the state after the first n-qubit Hadamard transform is applied is | x (| 0 - | 1 ) ,
x{0,1}n

(3.4)

which, after the f -controlled-NOT gate, is (-1)f (x) | x (| 0 - | 1 ) .
x{0,1}n

(3.5)

Finally, after the last Hadamard transform, the state is (-1)f (x)(x·y) | y (| 0 - | 1 ) .
x,y{0,1}n

(3.6)

Note that the amplitude of | 00 · · · 0 is x{0,1}n (-1)n so if f is constant 2 f (00··· 0) | 00 · · · 0 (| 0 - | 1 ); whereas, if f is balanced then, then this state is (-1) for the state of the first n qubits, the amplitude of | 00 · · · 0 is zero. Therefore, by measuring the first n qubits, it can be determined with certainty whether f is constant or balanced. Note that, as in Deutsch's simple example, this entails a single f -controlled-NOT operation. (This is a slight improvement of Deutsch and Jozsa's original algorithm, which involves two f -controlled-NOT operations.) Following Deutsch and Jozsa, Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani (1993) formulated a variation of the above problem that can be solved with the same network. Suppose that f : {0, 1}n  {0, 1} is of the form f (x) = (a1  x1 )  · · ·  (an  xn )  b = (a · x)  b , (3.7) where a  {0, 1}n and b  {0, 1}, and consider the goal of determining a. Note that such a function is constant if a = 00 · · · 0 and balanced otherwise (though a balanced function need not be of this form). Furthermore, the classical determination of a requires at least n f -controlled-NOT operations (since a contains n bits of information and each classical evaluation of f yields a single bit of information). Nevertheless, by running the quantum network given in Fig. 4, it is possible to determine a with a single f -controlled-NOT operation. The initial conditions are the same as above. In this case, Eq. (3.5) takes the simple form (-1)(a·x)b | x (| 0 - | 1 ) ,
x{0,1}n

(3.8)

which, after the final Hadamard transform, becomes (-1)b
x,y{0,1}n

(-1)x·(ay) | y (| 0 - | 1 ) ,

(3.9)

which is equivalent to (-1)b | a (| 0 - | 1 ). Thus, a measurement of the control register yields the value of a. (Bernstein and Vazirani's algorithm is similar to the above, except that it employs two f -controlled-NOT operations instead of one. Also, this problem, and its solution, is very similar to the search problems considered by Barbara Terhal and John Smolin (1997).)

The network construction presented in this section (Fig. 4) can be generalised to the case of a Boolean function f : {0, 1}n  {0, 1}m (with m  n), with the promise that the parity of the elements in the range of f is either constant or evenly balanced (i.e. its output values all have the same parity, or half of them have parity 0 and half have parity 1). In this case, by choosing an auxiliary register composed of m qubits, and setting all of them in the initial state (| 0 - | 1 ), it is possible to solve the problem with certainty in one run of the network. As in the above case, the function is constant when the n qubits of the first register are detected in state | 00 · · · 0 , and evenly balanced otherwise. A particular subclass of the above functions consists of those that are of the form f (x) = (A · x)  b, where A is an m × n binary matrix, b is a binary m-tuple, and  is applied bitwise (this can be thought of as an affine linear function in modulo-two arithmetic). The output string of f has constant parity if (11 · · · 1) · A = (00 · · · 0) and has balanced parity otherwise. It is possible to determine all the entries of A by evaluating the function f only m times, via a suitable multi-qubit f -controlled-NOT gate of the form |x |y
f -c-N

- | x | y  f (x) ,

(3.10)

where x  {0, 1}n and y  {0, 1}m . The network described below is a generalisation of that in Fig. 4, and determines the n-tuple c · A, where c is any binary m-tuple. The auxiliary register is composed of m qubits, which are initialised to the state (| 0 + (-1)c1 | 1 )(| 0 + (-1)c2 | 1 ) · · · (| 0 + (-1)cm | 1 ) . (3.11) (This state can be "computed" by first setting the auxiliary register to the state | c1 c2 · · · cm and then applying a Hadamard transform to it.) The n-qubit control register is initialised in state | 00 · · · 0 , and then a Hadamard transform is applied to it. Then the f -controlled-NOT operation is performed, and is followed by another Hadamard transform to the control register. It is straightforward to show that the control register will then reside in the state | c · A . By running the network m times with suitable choices for c, all the entries of A can be determined. Peter Høyer (1997) independently solved a problem that is similar to the above, except that f is an Abelian group homomorphism, rather than an affine linear function. 4.

It is interesting to note that the state (4.1) is unentangled, and can in fact be factorised as (| 0 + e2i(0.am ) | 1 )(| 0 + e2i(0.am-1 am ) | 1 ) · · · (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 a2 ...am ) | 1 ) . (4.2)

so the coefficient of | y1 y2 · · · ym in (4.1) matches that in (4.2). A network for computing F2n is shown in Fig. 5.

In the above network, Rk denotes the unitary transformation Rk = 1 0 k 0 e2i/2 . (4.5)

We now show that the network shown in Fig. 5 produces the state (4.1). The initial state is | a = | a1 a2 · · · am (and a/2m = 0.a1 a2 . . . am in binary). Applying H to the first qubit in | a1 · · · am produces the state (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 ) | 1 ) | a2 · · · am . Then applying the controlled-R2 changes the state to (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 a2 ) | 1 ) | a2 · · · am . Next, the controlled-R3 produces (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 a2 a3 ) | 1 ) | a2 · · · am , and so on, until the state is (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 ...am ) | 1 ) | a2 · · · am . The next H yields (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 ...am ) | 1 )(| 0 + e2i(0.a2 ) | 1 ) | a3 · · · am and the controlled-R2 to -Rm-1 yield (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 ...am ) | 1 )(| 0 + e2i(0.a2 ...am ) | 1 ) | a3 · · · am . Continuing in this manner, the state eventually becomes (| 0 + e2i(0.a1 ...am ) | 1 )(| 0 + e2i(0.a2 ...am ) | 1 ) · · · (| 0 + e2i(0.am ) | 1 ) , which, when the order of the qubits is reversed, is state (4.2). Note that, if we do not know a1 · · · am , but are given a state of the form (4.2), then a1 · · · am can be easily extracted by applying the inverse of the QFT to the state, which will yield the state | a1 · · · am .

R. Cleve, A. Ekert, C. Macchiavello and M. Mosca 5. A Scenario for Estimating Arbitrary Phases

In Sect. 1, we noted that differences in phase shifts by  can, in principle, be detected exactly by interferometry, and by quantum computations. In Sects. 2 and 3, we reviewed powerful computational tasks that can be performed by quantum computers, based on the mathematical structure of detecting these phase differences. In this section, we consider the case of arbitrary phase differences, and show in simple terms how to obtain good estimators for them, via the quantum Fourier transform. This phase estimation plays a central role in the fast quantum algorithms for factoring and for finding discrete logarithms discovered by Peter Shor (1994). This point has been nicely emphasised by the quantum algorithms presented by Alexi Kitaev (1995) for the Abelian stabiliser problem. Suppose that U is any unitary transformation on n qubits and |  is an eigenvector of U with eigenvalue e2i , where 0   < 1. Consider the following scenario. We do not explicitly know U or |  or e2i , but instead are given devices 2 1 that perform controlled-U , controlled-U 2 , controlled-U 2 (and so on) operations. Also, assume that we are given a single preparation of the state |  . From this, our goal is to obtain an m-bit estimator of . This can be solved as follows. First, apply the network of Fig. 6.

As noted in the last section, in the special case where  = 0.a1 . . . am , the state | a1 · · · am (and hence ) can be obtained by just applying the inverse of the QFT (which is the network of Fig. 5 in the backwards direction). This will produce the state | a1 · · · am exactly (and hence ). However,  is not in general a fraction of a power of two (and may not even be a rational number). For such a , it turns out that applying the inverse of the QFT produces the best m-bit approximation of  with probability at least 4/ 2 = 0.405 . . .. To see why this is so, let 2a = 0.a1 . . . am be the best m-bit m 1 estimate of . Then  = 2a + , where 0 < ||  2m+1 . Applying the inverse QFT m to state (5.1) yields the state 1 2m

Note that the above algorithm (described by networks in Figs. 5 and 6) consists k of m controlled-U 2 operations, and O(m2 ) other operations. In many contexts (such as that of the factoring algorithm of Shor), the above positive probability of success is sufficient to be useful; however, in other contexts, a higher probability of success may be desirable. The success probability can be amplified to 1 -  for any  > 0 by inflating m to m = m + O(log(1/)), and rounding off the resulting m -bit string to its most significant m bits. The details of the analysis are in Appendix C. The above approach was motivated by the method proposed by Kitaev (1995), j which involves a sequence of repetitions for each unit U 2 . The estimation of  can also be obtained by other methods, such as the techniques studied for optimal state estimation by Serge Massar and Sandu Popescu (1995), Radoslav Derka, Vladimir Buzek, and Ekert (1997), and the techniques studied for use in frequency standards by Susana Huelga, Macchiavello, Thomas Pellizzari, Ekert, Martin Plenio, and Ignacio Cirac (1997). Also, it should be noted that the QFT, and its inverse, can be implemented in the fault tolerant "semiclassical" way (see Robert Griffiths and Chi-Sheng Niu (1996)).

R. Cleve, A. Ekert, C. Macchiavello and M. Mosca 6. The Order-Finding Problem

In this section, we show how the scheme from the previous section can be applied to solve the order-finding problem, where one is given positive integers a and N which are relatively prime and such that a < N , and the goal is to find the minimum positive integer r such that ar mod N = 1. There is no known classical procedure for doing this in time polynomial in n, where n is the number of bits of N . Shor (1994) presented a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for this problem, and noted that, since there is an efficient classical randomised reduction from the factoring problem to order-finding, there is a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for factoring. Also, the quantum order-finding algorithm can be used directly to break the RSA cryptosystem (see Appendix A). Let us begin by assuming that we are also supplied with a prepared state of the form
r-1

| 1 =
j=0

e

-2ij r

aj mod N

.

(6.1)

Such a state is not at all trivial to fabricate; we shall see how this difficulty is circumvented later. Consider the unitary transformation U that maps | x to 1 | ax mod N . Note that | 1 is an eigenvector of U with eigenvalue e2i( r ) . Also, j for any j, it is possible to implement a controlled-U 2 gate in terms of O(n2 ) elementary gates. Thus, using the state | 1 and the implementation of controlledj U 2 gates, we can directly apply the method of Sect. 5 to efficiently obtain an estimator of 1 that has 2n-bits of precision with high probability. This is sufficient r precision to extract r. The problem with the above method is that we are aware of no straightforward efficient method to prepare state | 1 . Let us now suppose that we have a device for the following kind of state preparation. When executed, the device produces a state of the form
r-1

| k =
j=0

e-

2ikj r

aj mod N

,

(6.2)

where k is randomly chosen (according to the uniform distribution) from {1, . . . , r}. We shall first show that this is also sufficient to efficiently compute r, and then later address the issue of preparing such states. For each k  {1, . . . , r}, the eigenk value of state | k is e2i( r ) , and we can again use the technique from Sect. 5 to efficiently determine k with 2n-bits of precision. From this, we can extract r the quantity k exactly by the method of continued fractions. If k and r happen r to be coprime then this yields r; otherwise, we might only obtain a divisor of r. Note that, we can efficiently verify whether or not we happen to have obtained r, by checking if ar mod N = 1. If verification fails then the device can be used again to produce another | k . The expected number of random trials until k is coprime to r is O(log log(N )) = O(log n). In fact, the expected number of trials for the above procedure can be improved to a constant. This is because, given any two independent trials which yield kr1 and kr2 , it suffices for k1 and k2 to be coprime to extract r (which is then the least common denominator of the two quotients). The probability that k1 and k2

Quantum Algorithms Revisited are coprime is bounded below by 1-
p prime

1/p2 > 0.54 .

(6.3)

Now, returning to our actual setting, where we have no special devices that produce random eigenvectors, the important observation is that
r

|1 =
k=1

| k ,

(6.4)

and | 1 is an easy state to prepare. Consider what happens if we use the previous quantum algorithm, but with state | 1 substituted in place of a random | k . In order to understand the resulting behavior, imagine if, initially, the control register were measured with respect to the orthonormal basis consisting of | 1 , . . . , | r . This would yield a uniform sampling of these r eigenvectors, so the algorithm would behave exactly as the previous one. Also, since this imagined measurement operation is with respect to an orthonormal set of eigenvectors j of U , it commutes with all the controlled-U 2 operations, and hence will have the same effect if it is performed at the end rather than at the beginning of the computation. Now, if the measurement were performed at the end of the computation then it would have no effect on the outcome of the measurement of the control register. This implies that state | 1 can in fact be used in place of a random | k , because the relevant information that the resulting algorithm yields is equivalent. This completes the description of the algorithm for the order-finding problem. It is interesting to note that the algorithm that we have described for the order-finding problem, which is follows Kitaev's methodology, results in a network (Fig. 6 followed by Fig. 5 backwards) that is identical to the network for Shor's algorithm, although the latter algorithm was derived by an apparently j different methodology. The sequence of controlled-U 2 operations is equivalent to the implementation (via repeated squarings) of the modular exponentiation function in Shor's algorithm. This demonstrates that Shor's algorithm, in effect, estimates the eigenvalue corresponding to an eigenstate of the operation U that maps | x to | ax mod N . 7. Generating Arbitrary Interference Patterns We will show in this section how to generate specific interference patterns with arbitrary precision via some function evaluations. We require two registers. The first we call the control register; it contains the states we wish to interfere. The second we call the auxiliary register and it is used solely to induce relative phase changes in the first register. Suppose the first register contains n bits. For each n-bit string | x we require a unitary operator Ux . All of these operators Ux should share an eigenvector |  which will be the state of the auxiliary register. Suppose the eigenvalue of |  for x is denoted by e2i(x) . By applying a unitary operator to the auxiliary register conditioned upon the value of the first register we will get the following interference pattern:

The Conditional Uf gate that was described in section 2 can be viewed in this way. Namely, the operator Uf (0) which maps | y to | y  f (0) and the operator Uf (1) which maps | y to | y  f (1) have common eigenstate | 0 - | 1 . The operator Uf (j) has eigenvalue e2i 2 for j = 0, 1.

has the advantage that we can use the same eigenstate in the auxiliary register for any . So in the case of an n-qubit control register where we want phase change e2i(x) for state | x and if we have a reversible network for adding (x) to the auxiliary register when we have | x in the first register, we can use it on a superposition of control inputs to produce the desired phase "kick-back" e2i(x) in front of | x . Which functions (x) will produce a useful result, and how to compute them depends on the problems we seek to solve. 8. Conclusions Various quantum algorithms, which may appear different, exhibit remarkably similar structures when they are cast within the paradigm of multi-particle interferometry. They start with a Fourier transform to prepare superpositions of classically different inputs, followed by function evaluations (i.e. f -controlled unitary transformations) which induce interference patterns (phase shifts), and are followed by another Fourier transform that brings together different computational

paths with different phases. The last Fourier transform is essential to guarantee the interference of different paths. We believe that the paradigm of estimating (or determining exactly) the eigenvalues of operators on eigenstates gives helpful insight into the nature of quantum algorithms and may prove useful in constructing new and improving existing algorithms. Other problems whose algorithms can be deconstructed in a similar manner are: Simon's algorithm (1993), Shor's discrete logarithm algorithm (1994), Boneh and Lipton's algorithm (1995), and Kitaev's more general algorithm for the Abelian Stabiliser Problem (1995), which first highlighted this approach. We have also shown that the evaluation of classical functions on quantum superpositions can generate arbitrary interference patterns with any prescribed precision, and have provided an explicit example of a universal construction which can accomplish this task.

Appendix A. Cracking RSA What we seek is a way to compute P modulo N given P e , e, and N , that is, a method of finding eth roots in the multiplicative group of integers modulo N (this group is often denoted by ZN  and contains the integers coprime to N ). It is still an open question whether a solution to this problem necessarily gives us a polynomial time randomised algorithm for factoring. However factoring does give a polynomial time algorithm for finding eth roots for any e relatively prime to (N ) and thus for cracking RSA. Knowing the prime factorisation of N , say 1 pa1 pa2 . . . pak , we can easily compute (N ) = N n (1 - pi ). Then we can i=1 1 2 k compute d such that ed  1 mod (N ), which implies P ed  P modulo N . However, to crack a particular instance of RSA, it suffices to find an integer d such that ed  1 modulo ord(P ), that is ed = ord(P )k + 1 for some integer k. We would then have C d  P ed  P ord(P )k+1  P modulo N . Since e is relatively prime to (N ) it is easy to see that ord(P ) = ord(P e ) = ord(C). So given C = P e , we can compute ord(P ) using Shor's algorithm and then compute d satisfying de  1 modulo ord(P ) using the extended Euclidean algorithm. Thus, we do not need several repetitions of Shor's algorithm to find the order of a for various random a; we just find the order of C and solve for P regardless of whether or not this permits us to factor N . Appendix B. Concatenated Interference The generic sequence: a Hadamard/Fourier transform, followed by an f -controlledU , followed by another Hadamard/Fourier transform can be repeated several times. This can be illustrated, for example, with Grover's data base search algorithm (1996). Suppose we are given (as an oracle) a function fk which maps {0, 1}n to {0, 1} such that fk (x) = xk for some k. Our task is to find k. Thus in a

set of numbers from 0 to 2n - 1 one element has been "tagged" and by evaluating fk we have to find which one. To find k with probability of 50% any classical algorithm, be it deterministic or randomised, will need to evaluate fk a minimum of 2n-1 times. In contrast, a quantum algorithm needs only O(2n/2 ) evaluations. Grover's algorithm can be best presented as a network shown in Fig. 7.

Abstract A method for direct sampling of the exponential moments of canonical phase from the data recorded in balanced homodyne detection is presented. Analytical expressions for the sampling functions are shown which are valid for arbitrary states. A numerical simulation illustrates the applicability of the method and compares it with the direct measurement of phase by means of double homodyning.

Introduction

In the study of the problem of phase of a quantum harmonic oscillator, such as a radiation field, one usually proceeds in one of two different ways. In the first, the phase is defined from the requirement that phase and photon number should be complementary quantities. This firstprinciple definition leads to the canonical phase related to the one sided unitary phase operator [1, 2]. In the second way, phase quantities are defined from the output observed in phase-sensitive measurements, such as eight-port homodyne detection [3]. It was found that in such a scheme the Q function is measured [4]. The measured phase distribution can then be obtained by radial integration of the Q function. Whereas in the classical limit the measured phase coincides with the canonical phase, in the quantum regime the two phases significantly differ from each other in general. The most important difference is that the integrated Q function yields a broader and less structurized distribution than the canonical phase [5]. Is there a way which would bring together the advantages of these two approaches - i.e., the theoretical elegance and pronounced structure typical of the canonical phase and the advantage of experimental availability as in the case for the integrated Q function? Before addressing the problem in more detail, let us mention the concept of direct sampling of a quantity from experimental data. This concept has been studied extensively in connection with the density matrix reconstruction [6]. Assume a balanced homodyne measurement of a field quadrature x(), where  is the phase of the local oscillator (LO). Performing such measurements with different  on large ensembles of identically prepared states we obtain probability distributions p(x, ). A quantity A can be sampled from the homodyne data if it can be expressed as a two fold integral of the measured distribution,


A=

-

dx, KA (x, ) p(x, ),

(1)

where KA (x, ) is an integration kernel. The quantity A can represent, e.g., density matrix elements, mean values of operators, etc. Let us turn to the question of whether the canonical phase distribution can be directly sampled. In this case the quantity A in Eq. (1) is the phase probability, A = p(). In Ref. [7] it was suggested to obtain the exact phase distribution as the limit of a convergent sequence of appropriately parametrized (smeared) distributions each of which can directly be sampled from the homodyne data. The exact phase distribution can then be obtained asymptotically to any degree of accuracy, if the sequence parameter is chosen such that smearing is suitably weak. However, it turned out that whereas the method works well for states with low photon numbers, with higher excitation the smearing parameter must be chosen very small and the corresponding kernels become more and more structurized. This makes sampling problematic for highly excited states. We can see a discrepancy between the quantum and classical regions: on one hand phase can easily be measured in classical physics, on the other hand sampling of the phase distribution becomes tedious for states from the classical region. Can a unified approach be found which would bridge the gap between these two regions and which would enable us to measure the canonical and classical phase distributions on the same footing? In this contribution we show the possibility of direct sampling of the exponential phase moments of the canonical phase. The corresponding kernels are well behaved functions which, for large |x|, approach their classical counterparts. Since the moments contain the same information about the phase properties as the probability distribution itself, the method can serve as a way for experimental determination of the canonical phase.

Integration kernels

The canonical phase distribution p() of a state  is defined as p() = (2)-1 |^| , where ^  the phase states | are [2] | =  ein |n , |n being the Fock states. The exponential phase n=0 moments k of this distribution are given by k = 2 eik p() d and they can be expressed as


k =
n=0

n+k,n

(2)

for k positive and k =  for k negative. Our aim is to express k by means of the measured -k quadrature distribution p(x, ), i.e., in the form of Eq. (1) with A  k . For this purpose we must find the corresponding kernel Kk (x, ). To do so, let us express the distribution p(x, ) by means of the density matrix elements as
 

p(x, ) =
n=0 m=0

n (x)m (x)m,n ei(n-m) .

(3)

 Here n (x) are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, n (x) = (2n n! )-1/2 exp(-x2 /2) Hn (x), Hn (x) being the Hermite polynomials. Substituting Eq. (3) into (1) and comparing with Eq. (2) we find that the kernels must be of the form Kk (x, ) = eik Kk (x), where the x-dependent part must satisfy the integral equation

Figure 1: The functions Kk (x). In Fig. 1 we plot the functions Kk (x) for several values of k. As can be seen, the functions Kk (x) are well behaved and with increasing |x| they quickly approach their (classical) asymptotics c Kk (x), where
c 1 K2m+1 (x) = 4 (-1)m (2m + 1) sign (x)

c C2m being a (unimportant) constant. An essential difference between Kk (x) and Kk (x) appears only for x near zero, within the area of vacuum fluctuations. It is shown in [8] that the functions c Kk (x) can be obtained as kernels for sampling exponential phase moments in classical physics. Therefore, we have found kernels for direct sampling of the canonical phase moments which can be used for any state, regardless if it has typically quantum or classical properties.

3

Simulated measurements

To illustrate the applicability of the method we have performed computer simulations of homodyne measurements and used the kernels Kk (x, ) to determine the moments k . For comparison, we have also simulated double homodyne measurements to get exponential phase moments that correspond to the radially integrated Q function. In the computer simulations the state to be detected is the phase squeezed state |, s with the coherent amplitude  = 5×ei0 , 0 = 0.6, and the squeeze parameter s = 6 (the mean photon number of this state is n = 26.04). For both the homodyne and the double homodyne measurements the total number of measurement events is Ne = 6020. For the homodyne measurements the LO phase  takes 41 values equidistantly distributed over the 2 interval. As shown in [8], the statistical error of the sampled phase moments depends on the numbers of measurement events for different . By a proper distribution of the total number Ne for individual phases  we can decrease the statistical error of various moments k . In order to minimize the statistical error of the first moment 1 , we increased the number of measurement events for such  for which the peak of p(x, ) is near x = 0 (maximum 800 events), whereas for  yielding a peak far from zero the number of events was small (minimum 10 events).

Figure 2: Real (a) and imaginary (b) parts of the experimentally determined exponential phase moments k . Bars with full lines: direct sampling from balanced homodyning, bars with dashed lines: double homodyning. The vertical lines represent the estimated statistical error. The experimentally determined phase moments together with the estimated statistical errors are shown in Fig. 2. We can see that the absolute values of moments of the integrated Q function are smaller than the corresponding values of the canonical distribution; the difference becomes larger with increasing k. This corresponds to the fact that the integrated Q function smears the structure of the canonical distribution. Let us compare the statistical errors. For the odd moments the errors are approximately of the same magnitude in the two methods, whereas for the even moments the sampling method yields larger errors. This reflects the qualitatively different behavior of the kernels for k odd and k even. It is also related to the chosen numbers of measurement events for different : in our

example we have distributed the event numbers so as to minimize 1 which on the other hand increases the errors of even moments. Even though one could expect that the double homodyning - as a direct phase measurement - would yield generally smaller statistical errors, we find that the statistical error of the first moment 1 is smaller for the sampled canonical distribution. (The direct measurement means that a single measurement event yields a single value of phase.) Let us mention that the first moment is connected to very important characteristics of the phase distribution. The mean value of phase  can be calculated as  = arg1 ; this quantity can ¯ ¯ correspond, e.g., to a phase shift in an interferometer. Since 1 is determined more precisely in the balanced homodyning than in the double homodyning, the sampling method enables us to determine  with smaller statistical error. From the experimental data we obtain  = 0.5994±0.0011 ¯ ¯ for the sampling method, whereas from the integrated Q function we obtain  = 0.5990±0.0016. ¯ (Note that for both distributions the correct value is  = 0 = 0.6.) As can be seen, the error ¯ of determination of the mean phase by means of homodyne sampling is about 70% of the error in the double homodyning. The moment 1 is also related to various phase uncertainties, which describe the "width" of the phase probability distribution. A phase uncertainty  can be defined 2 as  = arccos|1 |, which is related to the Bandilla-Paul phase dispersion BP as BP = sin 2 and to the Holevo phase dispersion H as H = tan [9]. (An advantage of the uncertainty  is that it enables us to measure the phase width in the same units as the phase itself - in radians, degrees, etc.) In this way we obtain  = 0.065 for the canonical phase distribution and  = 0.125 for the integrated Q function.

Discussion and conclusion

The presented method shows a very straightforward way for obtaining the exponential moments of the canonical phase from the data of homodyne detection. Direct sampling enables us to reconstruct the moments k in real time as the experiment runs, together with the estimation of the statistical error [8]. In this way the theoretically profound concept of canonical phase can be connected with data obtained from present experiments. The moments k contain the same information as the probability distribution p(). Therefore they can be used for reconstruction of the original function p(). However, even the lowest moments give us an interesting information about the phase properties, e.g., the first moment 1 is directly related to the mean value of phase and to the phase uncertainty. The integration kernels are well-behaved functions which rapidly approach their asymptotics given either as step-functions (for odd moments) or logarithmic functions (for even moments). As shown in [8], these functions can serve as kernels for sampling of the phase moments in classical physics. Therefore, we have found a unified approach which connects the measurement of the canonical phase with its classical counterpart. It has been shown that the accuracy of the sampled moments of the canonical phase is comparable with that of the directly measured radially integrated Q function. Moreover, when the total number of measurement events is the same, the sampling method can yield the mean value of phase more precisely than the measurement of the Q function. Also this aspect can make the presented method very attractive for experimental applications.

Abstract The problem of photon adding and subtracting is studied, using conditional output measurement on a beam splitter. It is shown that for various classes of states the corresponding photon-added and -subtracted states can be prepared. Analytical results are presented, with special emphasis on photon-added and -subtracted squeezed vacuum states, which are found to represent two different types of Schr¨dinger-cat-like states. Effects of realistic photocounto ing and Fock-state preparation are discussed.

Quantum state engineering has been a subject of increasing interest and various methods for generating highly nonclassical states of optical fields have been proposed. A promising method for generating novel quantum states has been conditional measurement. In fact, when a system, such as a correlated two-mode optical field or a correlated atom-field system, is prepared in an entangled state of two subsystems and a measurement is performed on one subsystem, then the quantum state of the other subsystem can be reduced to a new state. In particular, it turned out that conditional measurement on a beam splitter may be advantageously used for generating new classes of quantum states [1]. Very interesting states are the so-called photon-added and photon-subtracted states that are obtained by repeated application of the photon creation and destruction operator, respectively, on a given state [1, 2, 3, 4]. In this paper we show that for various classes of states the corresponding photon-added and -subtracted states can be produced by means of conditional measurement on a beam splitter. In particular, when a signal mode is mixed with a reference mode prepared in a photon-number state and in one of the output channels no photons are detected, then the mode in the other output channel is prepared in a photon-added state. Accordingly, a photonsubtracted state is produced when the reference mode is in the vacuum and the conditional output measurement yields a nonvanishing number of photons. Typical examples of states the method applies to are thermal states, coherent states, squeezed states, displaced photon-number states and others. It is worth noting that photon-added and photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum states represent two different classes of Schr¨dinger-cat-like states. We analyze the states in terms of o quadrature-component distributions and phase-space functions and calculate the probability of producing them. Finally we discuss modifications that may be observed under realistic experimental conditions.

Generation of photon-added and -subtracted states

It is well known that the input­output relations at a lossless beam splitter can be treated within the SU(2) algebra. In the Schr¨dinger picture, the output-density operator out can be obtained o ^ ^  in V , where the operator V is given by V = ^ ^ ^ from the input­density operator in as out = V ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^    1 1  -i(T -R )L3 -2i L2 -i(T +R )L3 ^ ^ e e e , with L2 = 2i (^1 a2 - a2 a1 ) and L3 = 2 (^1 a1 - a2 a2 ). Let us assume a^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ that the input-state density operator can be written as in (n0 ) = in1  |n0 n0 |, n0 = 0, 1, 2... ^ ^ (1) (^in1 , density operator of the mode in the first input channel; |n0 , Fock state of the second input  mode), then the output-state density operator out  out (n0 ) can be given by ^ ^ n0 n0   1 (R )m2 +j Rn2 +k out (n0 ) = ^ |T |2n0 n2 =0 m2 =0 k=0 j=0 (-1)n2 +m2 × k!j!m2 !n2 ! n0 k n0 j n0 -k+m2 m2 n0 -j +n2 n2 (2)

where T = cos  eiT and R = sin  eiR , respectively, are the reflectance and transmittance of the beam splitter. From Eq. (2) we see that the output modes are, in general, highly correlated. When the photon number of the mode in the second output channel is measured and m2 photons are detected, then the mode in the first output channel is prepared in a quantum state whose density operator out1 (n0 , m2 ) reads as ^ m2 |^out (n0 )|m2  out1 (n0 , m2 ) = ^ . (3) Tr1 ( m2 |^out (n0 )|m2 )  The probability of such an event is given by

(2) and (3) we find that when a signal mode prepared in a state in1 =  p | | ^ (  p =1, 0 p 1) is mixed with a mode prepared in a Fock state and a zero-photon conditional ~ ~ measurement is performed in the second output channel (n0 > 0, m2 = 0), then the mode in the first output channel is prepared in the state -1/2 ^ out1 (n0 = 0, m2 = 0) = ^ p |n0 ,0 n0 ,0 |, |n0,0 = Nn0 ,0 (^ )n0 T n1 | . ~ a1 (5) ×


As can be seen, the state |n0 ,0 is a photon-added state, n0 photons beeing added to the state ^ T n1 | . For a number of classes of states (e.g., thermal, coherent, squeezed, displaced Fock ^ states etc.) the states | and T n1 | belong to the same class.In this case conditional output measurement provides us with a method for generating photon-added states of the class of states to which a signal-mode quantum state | belongs. Similarly, when the second input mode is in the vacuum state and a nonvanishing number of photons is detected (n0 = 0, m2 > 0), then a photon-subtracted state is produced: -1/2 ^ out1 (n0 = 0, m2 = 0) = ^ p | 0,m2 0,m2 |, |0,m2 = N0,m2 (^1 )m2 T n1 | . ~ a (6)


In Eqs. (5) and (6), N0,m2 and Nn0 ,0 are normalization constants. The probabilities of observing the photon-added and photon-subtracted states, respectively, are found from Eq.

State mixing in real experiments

Let us first address the problem of realistic photon-number measurement in photon-subtracted state generation. Since highly efficient and precisely discriminating photodetectors are not available at present, multichannel photon chopping [6] may be used. For a 2N-port apparatus the probability of recording k coincident events when m photons are present is given by ~ ~ PN, (k|m) = PN (k|l) Ml,m () (21)

In order to produce photon-added states, the second input mode must be prepared in a Fock state. This is a nontrivial experimental task, and a number of proposals have been made.

Figures. 1 and 2 reveal that ­ apart from some smearing ­ the non-classical Schr¨dinger-cat-like o features of photon-subtracted and photon-added squeezed vacuum states can still be preserved even under realistic experimental conditions. In particular it is seen that the typical quantum interferences can be observed.

Summary and Conclusion

We have studied the feasibility of generating photon-added and photon-subtracted states of a single-mode optical field via conditional output measurement on a beam splitter, with special emphasis on photon-added and -subtracted squeezed vacuum states. When a squeezed vacuum and an ordinary vacuum are mixed by a beam splitter and in one of the output channels a nonvanishing number of photons is detected, then a photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum in the other output channel is prepared, which shows all the features of a Schr¨dinger-cat-like state. o Another class of Schr¨dinger-cat-like states can be prepared when photons are not subtracted o from a squeezed vacuum but added to it, which is the case when a squeezed vacuum is mixed with a photon-number state and a zero-photon conditional output measurement is performed. We have derived the quadrature-component distributions and the Wigner and Husimi functions for the two classes of states. Further we have given the probabilities of preparing the states. It is worth noting that the component states of a Schr¨dinger-cat-like state of the type of a o photon-added squeezed vacuum can be regarded as non-Gaussian squeezed coherent states that tend to the familiar Gaussian squeezed coherent states (two-photon coherent states) as the number of added photons becomes sufficiently large. In contrast to photon adding, the component states of a Schr¨dinger-cat-like state of the type of a photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum are, in a o very good approximation, Gaussian squeezed coherent states which with increasing number of subtracted photons approach ordinary coherent states. With regard to realistic experimental conditions, we have considered multichannel photonnumber detection in photon-subtracted state generation as well as sub-Poissonian photon-number input statistics in photon-added state generation. As expected, realistic photon-number measurement smears the interference structure in the photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum, and a similar effect is observed in the photon-added squeezed vacuum when one allows for an input mode prepared in a sub-Poissonian statistical mixture of photon-number states in place of a pure Fock state. Nevertheless, the typical properties of Schr¨dinger-cat-like states can still be found even o under realistic conditions.

Abstract We consider the communication complexity of the binary inner product function in a variation of the two-party communication complexity scenario where the parties have an a priori supply of particles in an entangled quantum state. Previous proofs of lower bounds for the inner product function exist in scenarios where there is no initial entanglement, but they do not apply in the scenario with prior entanglement. In fact, there exist functions whose communication complexity with prior entanglement is provably less than that in models of communication without entanglement [5, 7]. We show that the communication complexity of the inner product function with prior entanglement is at least n/2. Our proof employs a novel kind of "quantum" reduction between protocols

Introduction

The communication complexity of a function f : {0, 1}n ×{0, 1}n  {0, 1} is defined as the minimum communication necessary among two parties, Alice and Bob, in order for each of them to acquire the value of f (x, y), where, initially, Alice is given x and Bob is given y. This scenario was introduced by Yao [18] and has been widely studied (see [13] for a survey). There are a number of technical choices in the model, such as: whether the communication cost is taken as the worst-case (x, y), or the average-case (x, y) with respect to some probability distribution; whether the protocols are deterministic or probabilistic (and, for probabilistic protocols, whether the parties have independent random sources or a shared random source); and, what correctness probability is required. The communication complexity of the inner product function f (x, y) = (x1  y1 )  · · ·  (xn  yn ) (1)

is fairly well understood in the above "classical" models. For worst-case inputs and deterministic errorless protocols, the communication complexity is n + 1 and, for randomized protocols (with a 1 shared random source), uniformly distributed inputs, and correctness probability 2 +  required, the communication complexity is n - O(log(1/)) [6] (see also [13, 17]). Yao [19] introduced a variation of the above classical communication complexity scenarios, where the parties communicate with qubits, rather than bits. Protocols in this model are at least

as powerful as probabilistic protocols with independent random sources. In [12], there is a proof (due to Yao) that, in this model, the communication complexity of the inner product function is (n), even if the required correctness probability is only 1 + . 2 Cleve and Buhrman [7] (see also [5]) introduced another variation of the classical communication complexity scenario that also involves quantum information, but in a different way. In this model, Alice and Bob have a supply of particles in an entangled quantum state (such as Einstein-PodolskyRosen (EPR) pairs), and the communication is in terms of bits. This model permits interesting nonlocal effects, such as those in [1, 8, 10, 14], to employed in protocols. In some cases, this results in lower communication complexity costs than possible in the classical models--as well as in Yao's qubit communication model. In this report, we consider the communication complexity of the inner product function in the model with prior entanglement. The proof methodology of the lower bound in the qubit communication model (without prior entanglement) [12] does not appear to carry over to this model. Nevertheless, we show that the errorless communication complexity of the inner product function in this model is at least n/2. Our proof employs a novel kind of "quantum" reduction between protocols, which enables any protocol for the inner product to be reduced to a protocol with essentially the same communication, in which n bits are communicated from Bob to Alice. No classical reduction can accomplish this.

Lower bound

We refer to protocols that employ a prior entanglement as protocols with entanglement. If the communication is in terms of bits [qubits] then we refer to a protocol as a bit [qubit] protocol. In this language, the protocols considered in [12, 19] are qubit protocols, while the protocols considered in [5, 7] are bit protocols with entanglement. Also, if the m bits [qubits] of communication consist of m1 bits [qubits] from Alice to Bob and m2 bits [qubits] from Bob to Alice then we refer to the protocol as an (m1 , m2 )-bit [-qubit] protocol. Suppose that there is an m-bit errorless protocol with entanglement for the inner product function. We shall prove that m  n/2 by a series of reductions. First, we "massage" the protocol into a special type of "reversible" qubit protocol with entanglement (a protocol for any function can be put into such a form). Second, we modify the reversible protocol by applying a simple unitary transformation before and after it. We show that this modified protocol conveys n bits of information from Bob to Alice. Finally, we convert the modified protocol into a (2m, 2m)-bit protocol which communicates an n-bit string from Bob to Alice. It is well known that, even with prior entanglement, for any protocol that accomplishes this, Bob must send n classical bits to Alice. The lower bound follows from this.

2.1

Reduction to a reversible protocol

In general, a bit protocol with entanglement uses nonreversible operations, such as measurements. A reversible qubit protocol is a special kind of qubit protocol (with or without entanglement) that follows the general spirit of the reversible programming paradigm in a quantum setting. All the information is quantum (though, if a qubit always resides in a |0 or |1 state then it can be regarded as classical). The initial state is of the form |x1 , . . . , xn  |0, . . . , 0  |SAB  |y1 , . . . , yn  |0, . . . , 0 ,
Alice's qubits Bob's qubits

(2)

where |SAB is the state of the entangled qubits shared by Alice and Bob, and the |0, . . . , 0 states can be regarded as "ancillas". At each turn, a player performs some unitary transformation on all the qubits in his/her possession and then sends a subset of these qubits to the other player. Note that, due to the communication, the qubits possessed by each player varies during the execution of the protocol. Also, the turns in such a protocol are reversible, and their affect on all the qubits is unitary. We say that a reversible protocol computes a function f (x, y) if, when executed on the initial state |z, x1 , . . . , xn  |0, . . . , 0  |SAB  |y1 , . . . , yn  |0, . . . , 0 , (3) the resulting final state is |z  f (x, y), x1 , . . . , xn  |0, . . . , 0  |SAB  |y1 , . . . , yn  |0, . . . , 0 . (4)

The "input", ancilla, and initial entanglement qubits will typically change states during the execution of the protocol, but they are reset to their initial values at the end. We now show that any errorless m-bit protocol with entanglement computing any function f (x, y) can be "massaged" into a (m, m)-qubit reversible protocol (with the same entanglement) computing f (x, y). In the original bit protocol, all local bits can be changed to qubits in |0 or |1 states, and classical boolean operations can be implemented unitarily. It can be assumed, without loss of generality, that, whenever a qubit is measured (in the standard basis always), its value becomes "frozen" thereafter in either state |0 or state |1 (depending on the result of the measurement). A frozen qubit is one that can only be used as the "control" qubit for some controlled unitary operation. (This is not very restrictive, because, from a frozen qubit, an unfrozen copy of it can be easily produced by performing a controlled-not opration with the frozen qubit as control and an ancilla qubit in state |0 as target.) The communication in bits can be converted into communication in terms of qubits. A slight subtlety here is that, when a classical bit is sent by (say) Alice, she can also keep a copy of it herself, whereas qubits cannot be copied; however, since the bits that Alice sends can be assumed to be frozen, this is not a problem, because such qubits can be copied as described above. Now, note that, whenever a qubit is measured, it is only used as the control qubit of controlled unitary operations thereafter. This means that all measurements of qubits can be postponed until the very end of the protocol, without changing the final state at the very end. Furthermore, since the protocol computes f (x, y), one of Alice's qubits must be in final state |f (x, y) regardless of whether the measurements at the end are performed at all! Thus, the measurements can be eliminated, resulting in an m-qubit protocol that is completely unitary. Finally, to reset the input, ancilla, and initial entanglement qubits, the protocol is run once, the answer is recorded, and then the protocol is run in the backwards direction. The answer is recorded on a "new" qubit of Alice (in initial state |z ), which is control-negated, with Alice's qubit that is in state |f (x, y) as control. Note that, for each qubit that Alice sends to Bob when the protocol is run forwards, Bob sends the qubit to Alice when run in the backwards direction. Running the protocol backwards resets all the qubits--except Alice's "new" one--to their original states. The result is an (m, m)-qubit protocol that reversibly computes f (x, y).

2.2

Main reduction

This reduction modifies the (m, m)-qubit reversible protocol from the previous subsection with f (x, y) set to the inner product function (1) so that, on the initial state (3), it produces the final 3

state |z, x1  (y1  z), . . . , xn  (yn  z)  |0, . . . , 0  |SAB  |y1 , . . . , yn  |0, . . . , 0 . This is accomplished in three stages: 1. Alice performs a Hadamard transformation on each her first n + 1 qubits. 2. Alice and Bob execute the reversible protocol for inner product. 3. Alice again performs a Hadamard transformation on each her first n + 1 qubits. Let us follow the evolution of the of the qubits after each of these stages. The net effect of each stage is restricted to the first n + 1 qubits of Alice, which begin in state |z, x1 , . . . , xn . After Stage 1, the state of Alice's first n + 1 qubits is

and, after Stage 2, this state becomes

where, in the first equation, the substitution a = c  (b1  y1 )  · · ·  (bn  yn ) has been made. It follows that, after Stage 3, the state is |z, x1  (y1  z), . . . , xn  (yn  z) , as required. (8)

Reduction to a communication protocol with entanglement

Notice that, by initializing z = 1 and x1 = · · · = xn = 0 and running the protocol of the last subsection, we obtain a (m, m)-qubit protocol that conveys the bits y1 , . . . , yn from Bob to Alice. Also, adding n additional EPR-pairs to the initial entanglement, teleportation [3] can be used to replace all qubit communication with classical communication. The result is a (2m, 2m)-bit protocol that communicates y1 , . . . , yn from Bob to Alice. For this to be possible, Bob must send at least n bits to Alice, so 2m  n. This proves that m  n/2.

Embellishments

If an even number of bits is sent at each turn of the original m-bit protocol for inner product then the so-called "superdense coding" of [4] can be used to convert the protocol into an (m/2, m/2)-qubit reversible protocol. The result of this extra efficiency is a stronger lower bound of m  n.

With a careful analysis of error probabilities we can obtain: for all  > 0, any protocol with entanglement that computes the inner product function correctly with probability 1 +  must have 2 (n) bits of communication.

Abstract. We consider the communication complexity of the binary inner product function in a variation of the two-party scenario where the parties have an a priori supply of particles in an entangled quantum state. We prove linear lower bounds for both exact protocols, as well as for protocols that determine the answer with bounded-error probability. Our proofs employ a novel kind of "quantum" reduction from a quantum information theory problem to the problem of computing the inner product. The communication required for the former problem can then be bounded by an application of Holevo's theorem. We also give a specific example of a probabilistic scenario where entanglement reduces the communication complexity of the inner product function by one bit.

Introduction and Summary of Results

The communication complexity of a function f : {0, 1}n × {0, 1}n  {0, 1} is defined as the minimum amount of communication necessary among two parties, conventionally referred to as Alice and Bob, in order for, say, Bob to acquire the value of f (x, y), where, initially, Alice is given x and Bob is given y. This scenario was introduced by Yao [16] and has been widely studied (see [13] for a survey). There are a number of technical choices in the model, such as: whether the communication cost is taken as the worst-case (x, y), or the average-case (x, y) with respect to some probability distribution; whether the protocols are

deterministic or probabilistic (and, for probabilistic protocols, whether the parties have independent random sources or a shared random source); and, what correctness probability is required. The communication complexity of the inner product modulo two (IP) function IP (x, y) = x1 y1 + x2 y2 + · · · + xn yn mod 2 (1)

is fairly well understood in the above "classical" models. For worst-case inputs and deterministic errorless protocols, the communication complexity is n and, for randomized protocols (with either an independent or a shared random source), uniformly distributed or worst-case inputs, and with error probability 1 -  2 required, the communication complexity is n - O(log(1/)) [7] (see also [13]). In 1993, Yao [17] introduced a variation of the above classical communication complexity scenarios, where the parties communicate with qubits, rather than with bits. Protocols in this model are at least as powerful as probabilistic protocols with independent random sources. Kremer [12] showed that, in this model, the communication complexity of IP is (n), whenever the required correctness probability is 1 -  for a constant 0   < 1 (Kremer attributes the 2 proof methodology to Yao). Cleve and Buhrman [8] (see also [6]) introduced another variation of the classical communication complexity scenario that also involves quantum information, but in a different way. In this model, Alice and Bob have an initial supply of particles in an entangled quantum state, such as Einstein-PodolskyRosen (EPR) pairs, but the communication is still in terms of classical bits. They showed that the entanglement enables the communication for a specific problem to be reduced by one bit. Any protocol in Yao's qubit model can be simulated by a protocol in this entanglement model with at most a factor two increase in communication: each qubit can be "teleported" [3] by sending two classical bits in conjunction with an EPR pair of entanglement. On the other hand, we are aware of no similar simulation of protocols in the entanglement model by protocols in the qubit model, and, thus, the entanglement model is potentially stronger. In this paper, we consider the communication complexity of IP in two scenarios: with prior entanglement and qubit communication; and with prior entanglement and classical bit communication. As far as we know, the proof methodology of the lower bound in the qubit communication model without prior entanglement [12] does not carry over to either of these two models. Nevertheless, we show (n) lower bounds in these models. To state our lower bounds more precisely, we introduce the following notation. Let f : {0, 1}n × {0, 1}n  {0, 1} be a communication problem, and 0   < 1 . 2 Let Q (f ) denote the communication complexity of f in terms of qubits, where  quantum entanglement is available and the requirement is that Bob determines the correct answer with probability at least 1- (the  superscript is intended to  highlight the fact that prior entanglement is available). Also, let C (f ) denote the corresponding communication complexity of f in the scenario where the

communication is in terms of bits (again, quantum entanglement is available and Bob is required to determine the correct answer with probability at least 1 - ). When  = 0, we refer to the protocols as exact, and, when  > 0, we refer to them as bounded-error protocols. With this notation, our results are: Q (IP ) = n/2 0 Q (IP )   C0 (IP )  C (IP )  =n

 max( 1 (1 - 2)2 , (1 - 2)4 )n - 2

Note that all the lower bounds are (n) whenever  is held constant. Also, these results subsume the lower bounds in [12], since the qubit model defined by Yao [17] differs from the bounded-error qubit model defined above only in that it does not permit a prior entanglement. Our lower bound proofs employ a novel kind of "quantum" reduction between protocols, which reduces the problem of communicating, say, n bits of information to the IP problem. It is noteworthy that, in classical terms, it can be shown that there is no such reduction between the two problems. The appropriate cost associated with communicating n bits is then lower-bounded by the following nonstandard consequence of Holevo's theorem. Theorem 1: In order for Alice to convey n bits of information to Bob, where quantum entanglement is available and qubit communication in either direction is permitted, Alice must send Bob at least n/2 qubits. This holds regardless of the prior entanglement and the qubit communication from Bob to Alice. More generally, for Bob to obtain m bits of mutual information with respect to Alice's n bits, Alice must send at least m/2 qubits. A slight generalization of Theorem 1 is described and proven in the Appendix. It should be noted that, since quantum information subsumes classical information, our results also represent new proofs of nontrivial lower bounds on the classical communication complexity of IP , and our methodology is fundamentally different from those previously used for classical lower bounds. Finally, with respect to the question of whether quantum entanglement can ever be advantageous for protocols computing IP , we present a curious probabilistic scenario with n = 2 where prior entanglement enables one bit of communication to be saved.

Bounds for Exact Qubit Protocols

In this section, we consider exact qubit protocols computing IP , and prove Eq. (2). Note that the upper bound follows from so-called "superdense coding" [4]: by sending n/2 qubits in conjunction with n/2 EPR pairs, Alice can transmit her n classical bits of input to Bob, enabling him to evaluate IP . For the lower bound, we consider an arbitrary exact qubit protocol that computes IP , and convert it (in two stages) to a protocol for which Theorem 1 applies.

For convenience, we use the following notation. If an m-qubit protocol consists of m1 qubits from Alice to Bob and m2 qubits from Bob to Alice then we refer to the protocol as an (m1 , m2 )-qubit protocol. 2.1 Converting Exact Protocols into Clean Form

A clean protocol is a special kind of qubit protocol that follows the general spirit of the reversible programming paradigm in a quantum setting. Namely, one in which all qubits incur no net change, except for one, which contains the answer. In general, the initial state of a qubit protocol is of the form |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 ,
Bob's qubits Alice's qubits

(6)

where |BA is the state of the entangled qubits shared by Alice and Bob, and the |0, . . . , 0 states can be regarded as "ancillas". At each turn, a player performs some transformation (which, without loss of generality, can be assumed to be unitary) on all the qubits in his/her possession and then sends a subset of these qubits to the other player. Note that, due to the communication, the qubits possessed by each player varies during the execution of the protocol. At the end of the protocol, Bob measures one of his qubits which is designated as his output. We say that a protocol which exactly computes a function f (x, y) is clean if, when executed on the initial state |z |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 , results in the final state |z + f (x, y) |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 (8) (7)

(where the addition is mod 2). The "input", the ancilla, and initial entangled qubits will typically change states during the execution of the protocol, but they are reset to their initial values at the end of the protocol. It is straightforward to transform an exact (m1 , m2 )-qubit protocol into a clean (m1 + m2 , m1 + m2 )-qubit protocol that computes the same function. To reset the bits of the input, the ancilla, and the initial entanglement, the protocol is run once, except the output is not measured, but recorded and then the protocol is run in the backwards direction to "undo the effects of the computation". The output is recorded on a new qubit of Bob (with initial state |z ) which is control-negated with the output qubit of Bob (that is in the state |f (x, y) ) as the control. Note that, for each qubit that Bob sends to Alice when the protocol is run forwards, Alice sends the qubit to Bob when run in the backwards direction. Running the protocol backwards resets all the qubits--except Bob's new one--to their original states. The result is an (m1 + m2 , m1 + m2 )-qubit protocol that maps state (7) to state (8).

2.2

Reduction from Communication Problems

We now show how to transform a clean (m1 + m2 , m1 + m2 )-qubit protocol that exactly computes IP for inputs of size n, to an (m1 +m2 , m1 +m2 )-qubit protocol that transmits n bits of information from Alice to Bob. This is accomplished in four stages: 1. Bob initializes his qubits indicated in Eq. (7) with z = 1 and y1 = · · · = yn = 0. 2. Bob performs a Hadamard transformation on each of his first n + 1 qubits. 3. Alice and Bob execute the clean protocol for the inner product function. 4. Bob again performs a Hadamard transformation on each of his first n + 1 qubits. Let |Bi denote the state of Bob's first n + 1 qubits after the ith stage. Then |B2 = |B1 = |1 |0, . . . , 0

(-1)c+b1 x1 +···+bn xn |c |b1 , . . . , bn

|B4 = |1 |x1 , . . . , xn ,

where, in Eq. (11), the substitution c = a+ b1 x1 + · · ·+ bn xn has been made (and arithmetic over bits is taken mod 2). The above transformation was inspired by the reading of [14] (see also [5]). Since the above protocol conveys n bits of information (namely, x1 , . . . , xn ) from Alice to Bob, by Theorem 1, we have m1 + m2  n/2. Since this protocol can be constructed from an arbitrary exact (m1 , m2 )-qubit protocol for IP , this establishes the lower bound of Eq. (2). Note that, classically, no such reduction is possible. For example, if a clean protocol for IP is executed in any classical context, it can never yield more than one bit of information to Bob (whereas, in this quantum context, it yields n bits of information to Bob).

Lower Bounds for Bounded-Error Qubit Protocols

In this section we consider bounded-error qubit protocols for IP , and prove Eq. (3). Assume that some qubit protocol P computes IP correctly with probability at least 1 - , where 0 <  < 1 . Since P is not exact, the constructions 2 from the previous section do not work exactly. We analyze the extent by which they err. First, the construction of Section 2.1 will not produce a protocol in clean form; however, it will result in a protocol which approximates an exact clean

protocol (this type of construction was previously carried out in a different context by Bennett et al. [2]). Denote the initial state as |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 . (13)

where ||2  (1-) and ||2  . In the above, the n+1st qubit is the designated output, x · y denotes the inner product of x and y, and x · y denotes the negation of this inner product. In general, , , |J , and |K may depend on x and y. Now, suppose that the procedure described in Section 2.1 for producing a clean protocol in the exact case is carried out for P . Since, in general, the answer qubit is not in the state |x · y --or even in a pure basis state--this does not produce the final state |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 . (15)

Also, assume that, in protocol P , Bob never changes the state of his input qubits |y1 , . . . , yn (so the first n qubits never change). This is always possible, since he can copy y1 , . . . , yn into his ancilla qubits at the beginning. After executing P until just before the measurement occurs, the state of the qubits must be of the form |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |J + |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K , (14)

However, let us consider the state that is produced instead. After introducing the new qubit, initialized in basis state |z , and applying P , the state is |z (|y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |J + |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K ) . After applying the controlled-NOT gate, the state is |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |J + |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K = |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |J + |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K (16)

-|z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K + |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K = |z + x · y (|y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |J + |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K )  1 1 + 2 2 |z + x · y - 2 |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K . (17)

Finally, after applying P in reverse to this state, the final state is  |z + x · y |y1 , . . . , yn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 + 2|Mx,y,z , (18) where |Mx,y,z =

P  |y1 , . . . , yn |x · y |K .

(19)

 Note that the vector 2|Mx,y,z is the difference between what an exact protocol would produce (state (15)) and what is obtained by using the inexact (probabilistic) protocol P (state (18)). There are some useful properties of the

|Mx,y,z states. First, as y  {0, 1}n varies, the states |Mx,y,z are orthonormal, since |y1 , . . . , yn is a factor in each such state (this is where the fact that Bob does not change his input qubits is used). Also, |Mx,y,0 = -|Mx,y,1 , since only 1 1 the ( 2 |z + x · y - 2 |z + x · y ) factor in each such state depends on z. ~ Call the above protocol P . Now, apply the four stage reduction in Section ~ in place of an exact clean protocol. The difference between the state 2.2, with P ~ produced by using P and using an exact clean protocol first occurs after the third stage and is   1 (-1)z 2y |Mx,y,z n+1

y |Mx,y,0 ,

 which has magnitude bounded above by 2 , since, for each y  {0, 1}n, |y |2  , and the |Mx,y,0 states are orthonormal. Also, the magnitude of this difference does not change when the Hadamard transform in fourth stage is applied. the Thus, the final state is within Euclidean distance 2  from |1 |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 |BA |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 . (21)

Consider the angle  between this final state and (21). It satisfies sin2  + (1 - cos )2  4, from which it follows that cos   1 - 2. Therefore, if Bob measures his first n + 1 qubits in the standard basis, the probability of obtaining |1, x1 , . . . , xn is cos2   (1 - 2)2 . Now, suppose that x1 , . . . , xn are uniformly distributed. Then Fano's inequality (see, for example, [9]) implies that Bob's measurement causes his uncertainty about x1 , . . . , xn to drop from n bits to less than (1 - (1 - 2)2 )n + h((1 - 2)2 ) bits, where h(x) = -x log x - (1 - x) log(1 - x) is the binary entropy function. Thus, the mutual information between the result of Bob's measurement and (x1 , . . . , xn ) is at least (1 - 2)2 n - h((1 - 2)2 )  (1 - 2)2 n - 1 bits. By Theo1 rem 1, the communication from Alice to Bob is at least 1 (1 - 2)2 n - 2 qubits, 2 which establishes Eq. (3).

Lower Bounds for Bit Protocols

In this section, we consider exact and bounded-error bit protocols for IP , and prove Eqs. (4) and (5). Recall that any m-qubit protocol can be simulated by a 2m-bit protocol using teleportation [3] (employing EPR pairs of entanglement). Also, if the communication pattern in an m-bit protocol is such that an even number of bits is always sent during each party's turn then it can be simulated by an m/2-qubit protocol by superdense coding [4] (which also employs EPR pairs). However, this

latter simulation technique cannot, in general, be applied directly, especially for protocols where the parties take turns sending single bits. We can nevertheless obtain a slightly weaker simulation of bit protocols by qubit protocols for IP that is sufficient for our purposes. The result is that, given any m-bit protocol for IP n (that is, IP instances of size n), one can construct an m-qubit protocol for IP 2n . This is accomplished by interleaving two executions of the bit protocol for IP n to compute two independent instances of inner products of size n. We make two observations. First, by taking the sum (mod 2) of the two results, one obtains an inner product of size 2n. Second, due to the interleaving, an even number of bits is sent at each turn, so that the above superdense coding technique can be applied, yielding a (2m)/2 = m-qubit protocol for IP 2n . Now, Eq. (2) implies m  n, which establishes the lower bound of Eq. (4) (and the upper bound is trivial). If the same technique is applied to any m-bit protocol computing IP n with probability 1 - , one obtains an m-qubit protocol that computes IP 2n with probability (1 - )2 + 2 = 1 - 2(1 - ). Applying Eq. (3) here, with 2n replacing  n and 2(1 - ) replacing , yields m  (1 - 2)4 n - 1 . For  > 2-4 2 = 0.146 . . ., 2  a better bound is obtained by simply noting that C  Q (since qubits can  always be used in place of bits), and applying Eq. (3). This establishes Eq. (5).

An Instance where Prior Entanglement is Beneficial

Here we will show that in spite of the preceding results, it is still possible that a protocol which uses prior entanglement outperforms all possible classical protocols. This improvement is done in the probabilistic sense where we look at the number of communication bits required to reach a certain reliability threshold for the IP function. This is done in the following setting. Both Alice and Bob have a 2 bit vector x1 x2 and y1 y2 , for which they want to calculate the inner product modulo 2: f (x, y) = x1 y1 + x2 y2 mod 2 (22)

with a correctness-probability of at least 4 . It will be shown that with entangle5 ment Alice and Bob can reach this ratio with 2 bits of communication, whereas without entanglement 3 bits are necessary to obtain this success-ratio. 5.1 A Two-Bit Protocol with Prior Entanglement

Initially Alice and Bob share a joint random coin and an EPR-like pair of qubits QA and QB : state(QA QB ) =
1  (|00 2

+ |11 )

(23)

With these attributes the protocol goes as follows.

First Alice and Bob determine by a joint random coin flip1 who is going to be the `sender' and the `receiver' in the protocol. (We continue the description of the protocol by assuming that Alice is the sender and that Bob is the receiver.) After this, Alice (the sender) applies the rotation Ax1 x2 on her part of the entangled pair and measures this qubit QA in the standard basis. The result mA of this measurement is then sent to Bob (the receiver) who continues the protocol. If Bob has the input string `00', he knows with certainty that the outcome of the function f (x, y) is zero and hence he concludes the protocol by sending the bit 0 to Alice. Otherwise, Bob performs the rotation By1 y2 on his part of the entangled pair QB and measure it in the standard basis yielding the value mB . Now Bob finishes the protocol by sending to Alice the bit mA + mB mod 2. Using the rotations shown below and bearing in mind the randomization process in the beginning of the protocol with the joint coin flip, this will be a protocol that uses only 2 bits of classical communication and that gives the correct value of f (x, y) with a probability of at least 4 for every possible combination of x1 x2 5 and y1 y2 . The unitary transformations used by the sender in the protocol are:     4 3 1 2 3 + i 80 -i 5 5 16   5    A00 =  A01 =     3 2 3 1 4 -i 5 - 16 + i 80 5 5

Because a joint random coin flip can be simulated with an EPR-pair, we can also assume that Alice and Bob start the protocol with two shared EPR-pairs and no random coins.

5.2

No Two-Bit Classical Probabilistic Protocol Exists 0 iff x = 00 or y = 00 1 9 iff x = 00 and y = 00

Take the probability distribution  on the input strings x and y, defined by: (x, y) = (26)

It is easily verified that for this distribution, every deterministic protocol with only two bits of communication will have a correctness ratio of at most 7 . Using 9 Theorem 3.20 of [13], this shows that every possible randomized protocol with the same amount of communication will have a success ratio of at most 7 . (It 9 7 can also be shown that this 9 bound is tight but we will omit that proof here.) This implies that in order to reach the requested ration of 4 , at least three bits of 5 communication are required if we are not allowed to use any prior entanglement. 5.3 Two Qubits Suffice Without Prior Entanglement

A similar result also holds for qubit protocols without prior entanglement [17]. This can be seen by the fact that after Alice applied the rotation Ax1 x2 and measured her qubit QA with the result mA = 0, she knows the state of Bob's qubit QB exactly. It is therefore also possible to envision a protocol where the parties assume the measurement outcome mA = 0 (this can be done without loss of generality), and for which Alice simply sends this qubit QB to Bob, after which Bob finishes the protocol in the same way as prescribed by the `prior entanglement'-protocol. The protocol has thus become as follows. First Alice and Bob decide by a random joint coin flip who is going to be the sender and the receiver in protocol. (Again we assume here that Alice is the sender.) Next, Alice (the sender) sends a qubit |Qx1 x2 (according to the input string x1 x2 of Alice and the table 27) to the receiver Bob who continues the protocol. |Q00 = |Q10 =

If Bob has the input string y1 y2 = 00, he concludes the protocol by sending a zero bit to Alice. In the other case, Bob applies the rotation By1 y2 to the received qubit, measures the qubit in the standard basis, and sends this measurement outcome to Alice as the answer of the protocol. By doing so, the same correctnessprobability of 4 is reached for the IP function with two qubits of communication, 5 whereas the classical setting requires 3 bits of communication as shown above.

Appendix: Capacity Results for Communication Using Qubits
In this appendix, we present results about the quantum resources required to transmit n classical bits between two parties when two-way communication is available. These results are used in the main text in the proof of the lower bound on the communication complexity of the inner product function, and may also be of independent interest. Theorem 2: Suppose that Alice possesses n bits of information, and wants to convey this information to Bob. Suppose that Alice and Bob possess no prior entanglement but qubit communication in either direction is allowed. Let nAB be the number of qubits Alice sends to Bob, and nBA the number of qubits Bob sends to Alice (nAB and nBA are natural numbers). Then, Bob can acquire the n bits if and only if the following inequalities are satisfied: nAB  n/2 (28) (29)

nAB + nBA  n.

More generally, Bob can acquire m bits of mutual information with respect to Alice's n bits if and only if the above equations hold with m substituted for n. Note that Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 2 because, if the communication from Bob to Alice is not counted then this can be used to set up an arbitrary entanglement at no cost. Graphically, the capacity region for the above communication problem is shown in Fig. 1. Note the difference with the classical result for communication with bits, where the capacity region is given by the equation nAB  n; that is, classically, communication from Bob to Alice does not help.

Proof of Theorem 2: The sufficiency of Eqns. (28) and (29) follows from the superdense coding technique [4]. The nontrivial case is where nAB < n. Bob prepares n - nAB  nBA EPR pairs and sends one qubit of each pair to Alice, who can use them in conjunction with sending n - nAB  nAB qubits to Bob to transmit 2(n - nAB ) bits to Bob. Alice uses her remaining allotment of 2nAB - n qubits to transmit the remaining 2nAB - n bits in the obvious way. The proof that Eqns. (28) and (29) are necessary follows from an application of Holevo's Theorem [11], which we now review. Suppose that a classical information source produces a random variable X. Depending on the value, x, of X, a quantum state with density operator x is prepared. Suppose that a measurement is made on this quantum state in an effort to determine the value of X. This measurement results in an outcome Y . Holevo's theorem states that the mutual information I(X : Y ) between X and Y is bounded by the Holevo bound [11] I(X : Y )  S() - px S(x ),
x

(30)

where px are the probabilities associated with the different values of X,  = x px x , and S is the von Neumann entropy function. The quantity on the right hand side of the Holevo bound is known as the Holevo chi quantity, (X ) = S() - x px S(x ). Let X be Alice's n bits of information, which is uniformly distributed over {0, 1}n. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that the protocol between Alice and Bob is of the following form. For any value (x1 , . . . , xn ) of X, Alice begins with a set of qubits in state |x1 , . . . , xn |0, . . . , 0 and Bob begins with a set of qubits in state |0, . . . , 0 . The protocol first consists of a sequence of steps, where at each step one of the following processes takes place. 1. 2. 3. 4. Alice performs a unitary operation on the qubits in her possession. Bob performs a unitary operation on the qubits in his possession. Alice sends a qubit to Bob. Bob sends a qubit to Alice.

After these steps, Bob performs a measurement on the qubits in his possession, which has outcome Y . (Note that one might imagine that the initial states could be mixed and that measurements could be performed in addition to unitary operations; however, these processes can be simulated using standard techniques involving ancilla qubits.) Let X be the density operator of the set of qubits that are in Bob's possession i after i steps have been executed. Due to Holevo's Theorem, it suffices to upper bound the final value of (X )--which is also bounded above by S(i ). We i consider the evolution of (X ) and S(i ). Initially, (X ) = S(0 ) = 0, since 0 i Bob begins in a state independent of X. Now, consider how (X ) and S(i ) i change for each of the four processes above. 1. This does not affect X and hence has no effect on (X ) or S(i ). i i

2. It is easy to verify that  and S are invariant under unitary transformations, so this does not affect (X ) and S(i ) either. i 3. Let B denote Bob's qubits after i steps and Q denote the qubit that Alice sends to Bob at the i + 1st step. By the subadditivity inequality and the fact that, for a single qubit Q, S(Q)  1, S(BQ)  S(B) + S(Q)  S(B) + 1. Also, by the Araki-Lieb inequality [1], S(BQ)  S(B) - S(Q)  S(B) - 1. It follows that S(i+1 )  S(i ) + 1 and (X ) = S(i+1 ) - i+1 px S(x ) i+1

Note also that S(i+1 )  S(i )+ 1 for this process, by the Araki-Lieb i inequality [1]. Now, since (X ) can only increase when Alice sends a qubit to Bob and by i at most 2, Eq. (28) follows. Also, since S(i ) can only increase when one party sends a qubit to the other and by at most 1, Eq. (29) follows. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.

ANALYTICAL MODELS FOR VALENCE FERMIONS IN ISOTROPIC TRAPS

For isotropic confining Ioffe-Pritchard or TOP potentials, a valence fermion trapped with a closed core of other fermions can be described by an analytical effective one-particle model with a physical eigenspectrum. Related constructions exist for Paul and Penning traps. The analytical models arise from quantum-mechanical supersymmetry. PACS: 11.30.Pb, 32.80.Pj

Electromagnetic traps may be divided into two categories: those that trap neutral particles or atoms, and those that trap charged particles or ions. The trapping mechanism for the former usually exploits the force experienced by a magnetic dipole in a nonuniform magnetic field. Typical configurations consist of a magnetic quadrupole field supplemented with a mechanism to reduce trapping losses near the field zero. Two well-established examples are the Ioffe-Pritchard trap [1, 2], which has end coils ensuring a nonzero-field minimum, and the time-averaged orbiting-potential (TOP) trap [3], which employs a rotating magnetic field. Discussions of various neutralparticle magnetostatic traps are given in Ref. [4]. Charged particles and ions can be trapped with the Paul trap [5], which involves an oscillating electric potential and can simultaneously trap particles of both polarities. An alternative is the Penning trap [6, 7], which combines electrostatic and magnetic fields and exists in many forms [8, 9, 10]. A general discussion of ion traps is given in Ref. [11]. The quantum behavior of many particles confined in a trap has been the subject of much recent experimental and theoretical work [12, 13]. Most investigations have centered on systems involving large numbers of bosons. In the present paper, we address instead some quantum-physics issues for certain traps containing one to a few hundred fermions, with the system in the ground state. We seek to describe the physics of an additional valence fermion added to such a system, perhaps in a highly excited state, using a relatively simple analytical model. Note that the focus of the present work is primarily theoretical issues involving quantum physics. In particular, we disregard experimentally important issues such as thermal effects [14, 13]. Part of our interest in situations of this type stems from the analogy with Rydberg atoms, which have played a central role in the development of tools for understanding multi-electron atoms [15]. Certain related developments could emerge in the context of multiparticle traps of the type we consider. Rydberg states of alkali-metal atoms are widely used for experimental and theoretical investigations, in part because the associated electronic core is relatively simple, forming a closed shell. For related reasons, in the present work we primarily consider systems of trapped fermions with the valence fermion lying outside a closed fermionic shell. The analogy with alkalimetal atoms is best for traps with a confining potential that is purely isotropic in 1

three dimensions. For certain values of the applied fields, the Ioffe-Pritchard and TOP traps provide examples that closely approximate this situation. Both the Ioffe-Pritchard and TOP traps capture magnetic dipoles µ aligned oppositely to an applied magnetic field B by drawing them into a region of minimum expelled from the trap. |B|. The potential energy is U(x, y, z) = µ |B|. Dipoles aligned with the field are The Ioffe-Pritchard trap consists of two coils with aligned symmetry axes in, say, the ^z direction and four conducting bars equidistant from and parallel to the z axis. e The coils carry parallel currents, while the bars carry alternately oriented currents. In cylindrical coordinates, the magnetic field to third order in  and z is BIP (, , z) = Bc^z + Bl  [cos 2^ - sin 2^ ] + e e e Bc ac (z 2 - 2 /2)^z - z^ e e 4 lc . (1)

In this expression, the coils are taken to have radius Rc , to carry currents Ic^ , e with  = /4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4, and to carry currents of magnitude Il . The other

2 4 where rc = lc /ac . Note that the orientation of the dipoles is anisotropic, for example,

lying roughly along the -^z direction near the z axis. e

The TOP trap involves two parallel coils as above, but carrying oppositely oriented

The time dependence creates a magnetic field vector that to lowest order lies parallel to the z = 0 plane and rotates with frequency b .

2 4 where rb = 14lb /5ab . Note that the dipole orientation is anisotropic, being opposite

to the time-averaged field Eq. (4) and pointing away from the origin along the z axis and radially towards the origin in the z = 0 plane. The Schr¨dinger equation for a particle in either isotropic trap is o - h2 2 ¯ r2  + µB0 + µB0 2 (r, , ) = E(r, , ) , 2m rs (7)

where m is the dipole mass, B0 = Bc or Bb , and rs = rc or rb . Separating in spherical polar coordinates, we write (r, , ) = (r0 /r)W (r)Y (, ), where Y (, ) 3

2 are spherical harmonics, r0 = (¯ /m0 )1/2 , and 0 = (2µB0 /mrs )1/2 . This choice puts h

the radial equation for W (r) into a convenient form: - h2 d2 ¯ h2 L(L + 1) ¯ 2 + + µB0 + 1 m0 r 2 W (r) = EN W (r) , 2 2 2m dr 2m r2 (8)

where the angular momentum quantum number L takes values L = 0, 1, 2, . . . and the energy eigenvalues are EN = µB0 + h0 (N + 3/2), with principal quantum number ¯ N = L, L+2, L+3, . . .. The wave functions are given in terms of generalized Laguerre polynomials:
2 2 WN,L (r) = CN,L (r/r0)L+1 exp(-r 2 /2r0 )LN/2-L/2 r 2 /r0 (L+1/2)

,

(9)

where the quantities CN,L are normalization constants. In what follows, it is useful to consider situations where a cloud of fermions forms a closed shell of energy levels in an isotropic trap. The number of fermions forming a closed shell below a particular value of N is determined by the degeneracies of states in the single-particle system. Examining the full wave functions and recalling that the allowed values of N increase in steps of two units, the degeneracy for a given N is found to be (N + 1)(N + 2)/2. Note that the doubling in atomic systems due to the two spin orientations has no analogue here because only dipoles oriented against the magnetic field are trapped. The number of particles completely filling levels less than or equal to N is (N + 1)(N + 2)(N + 3)/6. In the present work, we seek to construct relatively simple analytical one-particle models for the valence fermion in cases with more than one trapped particle. In addition to their intrinsic interest, such models could be used to make analytical predictions of physical properties or could provide a favorable starting point for perturbative and other calculations. The methodology applied here to generate effective models for various trap systems is related to that adopted in the development of a relatively simple analytical model for the valence electron in Rydberg atoms [16]. This model has been used in a variety of contexts [17, 18], including recently the prediction of certain experimentally observable features of long-term revivals in Rydberg atoms. Consider a system of fermions caught in a trap, with one particle excited relative to the others. This valence fermion can be regarded as moving in an effective potential 4

created by a combination of the trapping fields and interactions with the other trapped particles. We include among these interactions the quantum effects from the Pauli principle, which prevents the valence fermion from occupying filled levels, and also interparticle forces that act to modulate the trapping fields. In constructing analytical models for the valence fermion, we address first the issue of incorporating effects from the Pauli principle and subsequently examine an analytical extension that could describe other interparticle forces. accessible to a trapped valence fermion with angular quantum number L = 0 and with N even. If there is also a core of four fermions filling the energy levels below azimuthal quantum number M = 0. If only one particle is trapped, then N  0 To illustrate the idea, consider the particular tower of states |N, L = 0, M = 0

N = 2, then a valence fermion with L = 0 is restricted by the Pauli principle to trapped particles, the valence fermion in each of the two situations can access states with identical eigenenergies, except that in the five-particle case the N = 0 level is inaccessible. The issue of constructing an analytical effective one-particle theory to describe the L = 0 states of the valence fermion in the five-particle case can therefore be rephrased as the problem of finding an analytically solvable effective trapping potential with L = 0 energy eigenstates identical to those of the one-particle case but with the lowest one-particle level missing. Isospectral problems of this type can be treated in several ways. One approach might be the inverse method [19]. In the present work, we choose instead an alternative method with a definite physical interpretation that is both elegant and relatively simple, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics with the superalgebra sqm(2) [16, 17]. This supersymmetric technique takes as input a Schr¨dinger hamiltonian o H + for which the ground-state eigenenergy vanishes, and it determines via supersymmetry a complementary hamiltonian H - . By construction, the eigenstates of H - are degenerate with those of the original potential except for the ground state, which is absent. The eigenstates of the two systems H + and H - are related by an explicit levels with even N  2. Neglecting for the moment other interactions among the

where  ± are the eigenstates of H ± with eigenvalues E ± . The combinations of derivatives of U(r) generate associated potentials V ± (r). Since by assumption H + and hence V + (r) are given, the function U(r) can be found by solving a differential equation. The form of V - (r) and H - can then be deduced. The existence of the degeneracy and explicit map between excited states in the two eigenspectra is a direct consequence of the supersymmetry. This procedure can be applied to Eq. (8). Subtracting the ground-state energy EL = µB0 +¯ 0 (L+3/2) makes the lowest eigenvalue of the radial hamiltonian vanish, h as required by the method. This subtraction depends on the angular momentum L, which therefore must be fixed. The input potential becomes

It might be tempting instead to model the valence fermion directly using conventional oscillator wave functions, based on a shell-model approach where the Pauli principle is incorporated by hand. However, the supersymmetric eigenfunctions have several advantages. Unlike the conventional oscillator case, for which the lowest state must be excluded by hand, the supersymmetric states form a complete set. Moreover,
- the lowest-state radial eigenfunction WNs =2,L=0 (r) in our effective model has degree

zero and hence zero nodes, as expected for the ground state of the five-fermion system. A conventional oscillator wave function would have one node instead. The potentials V0- and V0+ differ by an inverse-square repulsive term: V0- (r) - V0+ (r) = h2 1 ¯ + h0 ¯ m r2 . (14)

In the present context, the additional repulsion in V0- plays the role of the Pauli principle by preventing the valence fermion from occupying the filled lower levels. Note that a change in the angular-momentum barrier would produce a similar effect on the potential but would not connect states with the same value of L. The above arguments for the case L = 0 can also be applied to other values of L. For example, in the case where the valence fermion has L = 1 the method produces a relation between two effective one-particle models, the first involving two trapped fermions with one in the ground state and the second involving eleven trapped fermions with ten filling the levels below N = 3. Iterations of the method produce further relations. When the valence fermion has L = 0, for instance, the effective one-particle model for the system with five trapped fermions described by Eq. (13) can in turn be related to another model for a system with 21 trapped fermions, 20 of which fill the levels below N = 4. Implementing this mathematically requires another shift of the energy zero so that the ground state of the five-particle system has zero energy. Repeating the procedure produces a series of interrelations between effective one-particle models for the L = 0 towers of states of systems with n = 1, 5, 21, 57, . . . trapped fermions. A similar iteration for L = 1 generates connections between systems with n = 2, 11, 36, 85, . . . trapped fermions. The two sequences of numbers are generated by the formula n = 1 + (N + 1)(N + 2)(N + 3)/6, with N = -1, 1, 3, . . . or N = 0, 2, 4, . . .. 7

The preceding discussion has largely disregarded effects of interactions between the trapped particles. If particle interactions are entirely neglected, the degeneracy of each fixed-N level means that the same effective one-particle model applies to the valence fermion in traps containing nd = d + (N + 1)(N + 2)(N + 3)/6 particles, where d = 1, 2, . . . , (N + 1)(N + 2)/2 is the number of fermions lying outside a closed shell. Although there may be special situations where particle interactions are relatively small, the possibility of additional interactions among the d valence fermions suggests that the best effective models would typically have d = 1. Similarly, the best effective models should also be ones describing small numbers of trapped particles and a relatively highly excited valence fermion. These considerations favor, for example, the model for the five-particle case with one highly excited fermion. Issues involving particle interactions could be addressed using a variety of standard methods, such as mean-field theory, perturbation theory, and Monte-Carlo methods. Given our present focus, we pursue here instead the possibility of incorporating interactions via analytical modifications to the effective models. Interactions typically shift the energy eigenvalues of the valence fermion. We treat this as a shift  = (N, L) in the principal quantum number. Since the effective model produces apparent integer shifts in L, we define for convenience an integer I = I(L) and introduce the effective principal quantum number N  = N +I -. It is also convenient to define Ns = N + 2I, a quantum number analogous to the spectroscopic principal quantum number in atomic systems. We therefore have N  = Ns - I - , ¯ with new energy eigenvalues EN  = µB0 + h0 (N  + 3/2). The problem is to find a modification of the radial potential in the above effective one-particle models such that the eigensolutions of the corresponding radial equation remain analytical but are associated with the modified eigenenergies EN  . This minor miracle can be accomplished by adding the effective potential VEFF (r) = h2 L (L + 1) - L(L + 1) ¯ + h0 (N - N  ) ¯ 2m r2 (15)

to the operator on the left-hand side of Eq. (8), where L = L + I - . The resulting

8

differential equation, h2 L (L + 1) ¯ h2 d2 ¯ 2 + + µB0 + 1 m0 r 2 W (r) = EN  W (r) , - 2 2 2m dr 2m r2 (16)

has eigenvalues EN  with N  = L , L + 2, L + 4, . . .. In terms of the functional form given in Eq. (9), the eigensolutions are WN  ,L (r). Note that the special case  = 0 reproduces all the complementary hamiltonians H ± discussed above when µB0 + h0 (L + 3/2 - 2S) is subtracted from both sides of Eq. (16). Thus, the radial ¯ equation for H + is recovered by selecting S = 0 and I = 0, while that for H - is recovered by selecting S = 1 and I = 1. The I0 th iteration of H + is obtained with S = 0 and I = I0 , while the corresponding H - has S = 1 and I = I0 + 1. The analysis given here has some similarities to the derivation of a relatively simple analytical model for the valence electron in Rydberg atoms discussed in Refs. [16, 17, 18]. For example, our treatment of the L = 0 states of isotropic trap systems with 1, 5, 21, 57, . . . fermions resembles that of the s-orbital states of alkali-metal atoms in the Rydberg case. Note that, since in the present trap context the valence fermion is typically neutral, its interactions involve a dipole moment rather than a monopole charge. This suggests that the effect of interactions may be significantly smaller than in the Rydberg case and the effective models correspondingly better. Note also that the form of the effective potential (15) is reminiscent of the special analytical model investigated in Ref. [20]. In the atomic case, orthogonality of the model eigenfunctions arises because the quantum defects in, for example, alkali-metal atoms are asymptotically independent of the principal quantum number. Similarly, in the present context the eigenfunctions WN  ,L (r) form an orthonormalizable basis provided  is independent of N with  < L+I+3/2. The N-independence implies that for each fixed L only one parameter is needed, corresponding to a simultaneous shift of the principal quantum numbers for that tower of states. Experience gained in the atomic case suggests that rapid asymptotic N-independence is likely to suffice for applicability of the models here. However, it is unclear a priori which trap systems have this feature, as it depends on details of the many-body dynamics. Experimental investigations establishing energy spectra for the systems considered here would be of interest. The eigenfunctions 9

WN  ,L (r) could then be used to predict other quantities such as transition rates. In contrast to the Ioffe-Pritchard or TOP traps, which can be isotropic in three dimensions, the Paul and Penning traps are generically isotropic in two dimensions.1 Effective one-particle models can nonetheless be obtained via a similar approach. For brevity, we restrict ourselves to outlining the treatment of the case where interactions of the valence fermion are neglected. Effective one-particle models analogous to Eq. (16) that allow for level shifts can also be constructed for the Paul and Penning traps. The Paul trap consists of a time-dependent potential given in cylindrical coordi~ ~ nates by (, , z, t) = (, , z) cos p t, where  is (, , z) = Vp 2 (z - 2 /2) 2d2 p (17)

The p associated quantum problem separates with a wave function of the form (, , z) = (p /)1/2 X()(, z), where p = (¯ /mp )1/2 . Introducing the quantum numbers h K = 0, 1, 2, . . . and M = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . gives  M,K (, z) = AK exp(iM) exp(-z 2 /2 )HK ( 2 z/p ) , p (19)

In a particular rotating frame, a single particle in a Penning trap with a special ratio of applied fields can experience an isotropic potential in three dimensions. The incorporation of rotation effects, including those on any fermion core, could then allow a treatment similar to that for the Ioffe-Pritchard and TOP traps.

The magnetron motion is also unstable, so the corresponding quantum-number combination (N + M)/2 cannot be too large. In closing, we remark that the radial equations for all the traps considered in this paper can be mapped into various radial equations for Coulomb-type potentials [24], among which is the usual radial Coulomb equation in three dimensions. This suggests that under suitable circumstances the analogies drawn above between atoms and trapped systems might be more than heuristic. It would be amusing, for example, to identify a trap system for which the oscillator energy shifts correspond via a direct map to known quantum defects for an alkali-metal atom. We thank R. Bluhm, G.

Space, time, parallelism and noise requirements for reliable quantum computing

arXiv:quant-ph/9708021v1 12 Aug 1997

Quantum error correction methods use processing power to combat noise. The noise level which can be tolerated in a fault-tolerant method is therefore a function of the computational resources available, especially the size of computer and degree of parallelism. I present an analysis of error correction with block codes, made fault-tolerant through the use of prepared ancilla blocks. The preparation and verification of the ancillas is described in detail. It is shown that the ancillas need only be verified against a small set of errors. This, combined with previously known advantages, makes this `ancilla factory' the best method to apply error correction, whether in concatenated or block coding. I then consider the resources required to achieve 2 × 1010 computational steps reliably in a computer of 2150 logical qubits, finding that the simplest [[n, 1, d]] block codes can tolerate more noise with smaller overheads than the 7L -bit concatenated code. The scaling is such that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to contemplate.

Large-scale quantum computation can be regarded either as a realistic future possibility, or as a theoretical device which enables basic questions to be asked about quantum mechanics and the computational power of machines. In either case, an important fundamental issue is that of the conditions required to enable a given computational problem to be solved on a quantum computer. Until recently, it was believed that the effects of noise were more or less insurmountable in a complex quantum system such as a quantum computer. However, two discoveries have greatly shaken this belief. These are the possibility of efficient quantum error correction for arbitrarily large computers [1,2], and the possibility of faulttolerant correction and computing [3,4]. An important third idea is that of concatenated coding, [5,6]. The use of concatenated coding, combined with fault-tolerant methods, enables the important threshold result to be obtained [6­11]. This result states that in order for arbitrarily long computations to be possible, the noise level  per elementary operation need not be arbitrarily small, but need only be below a threshold value 0 . The noise must have various special properties for this result to be valid, such as that the effects of noise at different qubits and at different times are independent, that  does not grow when the computer is made larger, and that arbitrarily many elementary operations can be performed in parallel. The threshold result is an important element of the basic theory of the control of noise in a quantum com1

puter. However, just as it is meaningless to talk about the amount of noise without stating what type of noise one is dealing with, it is also meaningless to talk about a threshold error rate without stating what other computational resources are needed. For example, it is easy to see that the greater degree of parallelism one assumes, the less stringent are the requirements on memory errors in a quantum computer. The threshold result is really a statement about how the noise requirements scale with other requirements. The inevitable cost of the threshold is that concatenated coding is inefficient in both space (number of qubits) and time (number of elementary operations), compared with non-concatenated codes. In view of this, it is important to compare different coding and correction methods on the basis of all the relevant parameters. Fault-tolerant error correction using non-concatenated codes is very powerful if we take advantage of the approach I put forward in an earlier paper [12]. In this approach, the task of error correction is reduced essentially to one of quantum state synthesis. The most important task for a quantum computer is to generate verified copies of the encoded zero state |0E in ancilliary blocks of qubits. I will refer to this method as the `ancilla factory' method. For sufficiently long computations, a concatenated correction method is probably the best choice because of the threshold result. However, the estimates in [12] suggest that the size of computation (number of logical qubits times number of computation steps) may well be very large (> 1015 ) before concatenated coding is preferable to simple block coding with the ancilla factory method. The present paper will elucidate this by providing a more complete analysis of the ancilla factory than was done previously. In particular, the network required to verify the ancilla state is fully specified and taken into account. It is noteworthy that this network performs a minimal error detection, in a sense to be described. Also, the usefulness of measuring the syndrome and using classical processing to interpret it, rather than a further quantum network, will be underlined. I will show that the ancilla factory method makes error correction using CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane [1,2], see also [16]) codes sufficiently efficient that it compares favourably with the concatenation method, even for a large computational task such as factorisation of a 130 digit (430 bit) number using Shor's algorithm. The main conclusion of this study is a `bench mark' indication of the power of different error correction methods, in terms of four parameters: the noise level, the `scale up' (increased number of qubits), the `slow down'

(increased number of operations) and the degree of parallelism (ability to apply many gates simultaneously) required to make a computer sufficiently reliable to carry out a specific difficult task. This bench mark is offered as a target for others to bring down, either by optimisation of current methods or by finding radically new ones. It is a rough guide to the hardware which would be needed if large scale quantum computations were to be attempted one day.
I. CHOICE OF METHOD

There are two requirements for error correction techniques to be used to stabilize a quantum computer. These are fault-tolerant error correction, and fault-tolerant computational operations. Two approaches to faulttolerant error correction were put forward by Shor [3] and Kitaev [4]. In Shor's approach, the quantum error correcting code (QECC) is taken from a subset of the CSS codes described in [1,2], and the syndrome extraction is carefully arranged so as to restrict the propagation of errors. In Kitaev's approach the QECC is itself designed so that each qubit is involved in a bounded number of check operators (a `local check code'), so that even a straightforward extraction of the syndrome will not propagate errors too far. Shor's fault-tolerant syndrome extraction was generalised to all stabilizer codes [13,14] by DiVincenzo and Shor [15]. The ancilla factory method which I have proposed is closely related to Shor's ideas. Since it is to my knowledge the best method currently known, it is used in this study. Aharanov and Ben-Or [8] have discussed fault-tolerant methods in which syndromes are not measured (ie converted into classical information) during the computation, but are interpreted within the unitary quantum evolution. The advantage of avoiding measurements is that the analysis is simpler, and measurements will almost certainly be slow compared to unitary operations in an experimental system. However, the disadvantage is that the quantum computer must be made much larger in order to store the extra `garbage' manufactured by error corrections, and measurements provide robust classical information which is very useful since much of the syndrome interpretation can then be done classically. For these reasons I retain the use of measurements. Fault-tolerant computational operations have been discussed for various types of stabilizer code. A universal set of operations was described by Shor [3] for CSS codes obtained by puncturing a self-dual classical code whose words all have weight equal to a multiple of four (`doubly even' codes). Further methods were described by Knill et. al. [7] for codes obtained by puncturing one with with weights divisible by 8 and dual distance  4. The same authors give some more techniques in [10], based partly on the ideas of Kitaev [6]. Rotations, such as those needed in a Fourier transform network, are considered by

Preskill [11]. Gottesman has described methods by which a universal set of operations can be obtained for any stabilizer code [16], though some of these methods are considerably more complicated than the ones designed for particular codes. The general rule is that the more symmetry and simplicity there is in the code construction, the simpler are the fault-tolerant methods. This study will be restricted to quite simple codes, namely [[n, 1, d]] CSS codes obtained by puncturing a doubly even classical self-dual code. The notation [[n, k, d]] refers to a QECC encoding k qubits into n, with minimum distance d, thus t = (d - 1)/2-error correcting. Note that we choose to encode only a single qubit in each block, and restrict ourselves to doubly-even codes in order to allow a large set of bitwise operations. It may well be worth while to sacrifice some of the simplicity in the computational operations in order to gain more efficient storage; this is an avenue for future work.
II. ASSUMPTIONS

In order to estimate the reliability of the encoded quantum computer, we will make a set of standard assumptions about the noise, which have been discussed by several authors [5,10,11]. Note that much more general error models have been considered by Knill et. al. [17,7,10]. The noise model assumes independent stochastic errors among the qubits, whose overall effect can be estimated by adding classical error probabilities rather than quantum amplitudes. In other words, to keep the problem managable we will only try to find out the limitations imposed by such random errors. We will adopt the depolarising channel model for the noise on each qubit [18]. For a given error opportunity, a qubit remains unchanged with probability 1 - p, and undergoes x , y or z errors with equal probabilties p/3. Of all the errors that occur, on average 2/3 will require correction in the computational basis {|0 , |1 } and 2/3 in the conjugate basis {|0 +|1 , |0 -|1 }. The errors x and z will be referred to as `bit errors' and `sign errors' respectively. To model the noise in a gate operating on two qubits, we assume the gate produces the action it should, followed by error operators. There are sixteen possible error operators, all the members of the set {I, x , y , z }  {I, x , y , z }. If the gate error probability is p, we assume the error-free case I  I occurs with probability 1 - p, and the other 15 cases occur with equal probabilities p/15. However, we will not take advantage of the fact that errors in the two qubits are correlated (for example if a bit-error is found in the first qubit, the probability of bit-error in the second qubit rises from (8/15)p  1 to 1/2.) Rather, we assume that with probability O(p) (not p2 ) errors are produced in both qubits, but we must correct the errors as if they were independent. Thus we

2

over-estimate the difficulty of error correction. Furthermore, we will overestimate the probability 8/15 as 2/3, to simplify the equations. As usual in quantum error correction, when we talk of errors occuring with given probabilities, we refer to the probabilities that the quantum state is projected onto each state of well-defined error syndrome, when the syndrome is later extracted. We allow for relaxation in the system by permitting states of different syndrome to be entangled with different environment states [2,17]. The most important, and possibly unphysical, assumption is that error probabilities can be multiplied. That is, if one error has probability p1 , and another p2 , the probability of getting both is p1 p2 . This is reasonable if errors at different places and times are uncorrelated with one another, and it corresponds to the standard Gaussian noise model commonly used in physics. However, noise in real systems often has two components: one which can be well described in terms of standard Gaussian statistics, where the probability of obtaining an event many standard deviations from the mean falls exponentially with the distance from the mean, and another component in which the wings of the probability distribution are much higher. In other words, rare events are much more likely in practice than one would suppose on the basis of the standard treatment of experimental error. The correction methods discussed here cannot provide stability against such noise. In order to handle it, others methods must be used in conjuction with the error correction we are considering. The overhead required to implement error correction depends on the noise level. When estimating the scaling of this overhead with the noise level, it is convenient to assume that the noise level per qubit is independent of the total number of qubits in the computer. Such an assumption is required, for example, for the threshold result for concatenated codes. This is unlikely to be valid for a real device. However, when giving the noise level required for a task on a computer with a specified number of qubits, no assumption about the scaling of noise need be made. Another consideration is that of parallelism, ie the number of quantum gates that can be executed in parallel in a single time step. A large degree of parallelism turns out to be necessary in order to keep storage errors under control. For this reason we will be explicit about the degree of parallelism involved in the methods to be discussed. Most of the quantum gates in the stabilized computer will be involved in error correction rather than the execution of a computational step. For this reason most two-qubit gates only connect qubits within a few blocks of one another. However, a computational step might involve pairs of qubits anywhere in the computer. It will be assumed that such gates can be applied to any pair of qubits without any significant extra cost. Fault tolerant quantum computation makes much use of state preparation and measurement. These irreversible 3

operations involve an amplification of some kind1 if they are to be done reliably. They are therefore much slower than a unitary quantum gate. In a practical system one would probably wish to allow many gates to be carried out on other (unrelated) qubits during the time any given qubit is prepared or measured, but this will complicate the analysis here. We will allow the same time (in fact one time step) for a gate as for a measurement. Therefore the results are strictly valid only if the time step is taken to be the time necessary for a measurement rather than a gate. However, there are many more gates than measurement operations in the networks actually used, therefore it is a fair approximation to take the time step to be that of a gate. A further question of speed of operation is that involved in decoding of the error syndromes. This is done by a dedicated classical computer, and we assume that the result is available within the time required to prepare an ancilla state in the quantum computer. This is itself quite a large classical computation, involving decoding thousands of (n - 1)-bit syndromes, where n = 23, 55, 87 for the codes to be discussed. Finally, the important question of leakage errors is here assumed to be solved, for example by converting leaked qubits into erroneous ones, using leak detection circuits as in [11]. The overhead represented by such additional circuits will not be included in the analysis.

III. ANALYSIS

We will adopt the following notation. The computation to be performed requires K logical qubits and Q computational steps. This is achieved in a set of N > K physical qubits using T > Q elementary gates. N is of order nK, where n is the block size of the [[n, 1, d]] CSS code used. The number of correctable qubit errors per block is t = (d-1)/2. The parameters K, Q, N, T, n, t are integers. The noise is parametrised by two real numbers,  the gate or measurement error probability, and  the store error probability per qubit per time step. The parameters of the logical computer are K and Q. This logical computer is embedded in a physical computer of parameters N and T . We use the language `computational step' to mean a gate on encoded qubits which evolves the logical computation, and `elementary gate' for a gate on bare qubits. The main overheads involved in error correction are the `scale-up' N/K and the `slowdown' T /Q (number of gates per computational step). The amount of time required to finish the computation is of order T divided by the degree of parallelism.

1 Roughly speaking, this is an amplification from the quantum to the classical level.

We will analyse a complete fault-tolerant computation, using correction by a block code, and then compare with the requirements for a concatenated code, drawing on the work of Preskill [11]. The `ancilla factory' error correction method is based on the generation of the encoded zero state |0E , as described in [12]. The n-qubit block to be corrected will be referred to as b, and the n-qubit ancilla as ax . A further qubit is used for verification of ax . We imagine that error correction is carried out in parallel on all the K blocks in the computer. However, within a block we will restrict parallel operation to single-bit gates2 . The state |0E is generated in ax and then rotated by the Hadamard transform H applied bitwise. Since we are using [[n, 1, d]] CSS codes this produces the state |0E + |1E (ignoring normalisation). The network to perform these operations is given in fig. 1 for the 7-bit code [[7, 1, 3]] [19]. The general features of the method were described in [12], but here we will be specific about the networks and the propagation of errors. The network in fig. 1 is designed both to generate and to verify the state required. If an error is detected, the network is restarted from the beginning. The verification only picks up bit errors (Pauli x operator) in the state, not sign errors (Pauli z operator). This is because bit errors would be converted into sign errors by the Hadamard transform, and then carried into b by the subsequent xor operations, so we must guard against them. Sign errors will be converted into bit errors by the Hadamard transform, and result in an incorrect syndrome. The fact that sign errors (before the H gates) can propagate from one qubit to many is not a problem since in any case we will assume that a single sign error makes the syndrome invalid. A bit error, before the verification gates, can also propagate from one qubit to many, but such errors will be detected and the ancilla preparation restarted. The remaining undetected bit errors are uncorrelated. Meanwhile a separate ancilla az is prepared, in parallel (see fig. 3), to be used for correction of sign errors in b. The preparation network is the equivalent of fig. 1 but in the conjugate basis. Let us first confirm the claim about the verification of the ancilla, namely that only uncorrelated sign (bit) errors are finally coupled from ax (az ) into b. The network of fig. 1 can be divided into three parts: generation, verification, and Hadamard transformation. First assume the verifier gates are noise-free. Then the most general state which can survive the verification is ci |i  |ei

make use of the simple equivalence shown in fig. 2. The most general error-free state of b is  |0E +  |1E . The Hadamard transformation of b (see fig. 2) carries this state to jC ( + ) |j + ( - ) |¬j , written using the same basis states as eq. (1). To obtain this form we have made use of the CSS code construction C  C  . The xor between ax and b produces ci |i |ei

since displacing a linear code by a member of the code simply moves the code onto itself. Hence the most general noisy state of ax which survives noise-free verification produces no errors in b. The significant point is that this is achieved with only a weak verification: one which detects none of the sign errors and only those bit-error vectors which are not in C, which is a small set (only 24 out of 27 ). When we allow the verification to be itself noisy, its gates introduce both bit and sign errors. However, the verification network is one in which bit errors can not propagate among the qubits of ax , therefore the bit errors which are produced are uncorrelated. The same is true for the Hadamard transformation of ax at the end of fig. 1. The network of fig. 1 involves 46 elementary operations and 30 time steps. An elementary operation is taken to be a gate applied to bare (non encoded) qubits, or a preparation or measurement of a bare qubit. It is assumed that single-qubit elementary operations can be carried out in parallel with double-qubit ones. More generally, if the generator matrix of the classical code giving |0E in the quantum code has m rows, and the average weight of a row is w, then the numbers of operations and time steps are as follows. There are n + 1 preparation operations, m + 1 measurement operations, and n+m Hadamard gates, making 2(n + m + 1) single-bit operations. There are m(w - 1) xor gates between qubits in ax , and m(w + 1) xor gates between ax and the verification bit, where we have used the fact that the code is [[n, 1, d]], so the final parity check in the verifier needs m gates (this verifies that |0E , not |1E , has been generated). The number of time steps is m(w - 1) + 2 + m(w + 1) + m + 1 = m(2w + 1) + 3. (2) For the [[n, 1, d]] CSS codes which we are considering, m = (n - 1)/2 and w = d + 1 [2]. The number of time steps is thus nw + (n + 5)/2 - w. This completes the preparation of ax . Once the ancilla state is prepared, ax and b interact by an xor gate applied transversally, ie n elementary operations, and then the ancilla is measured. These xor gates 4

in b, so even if we have greatly underestimated the probability of using the wrong syndrome, the final conclusions about error rates will be unaffected. The choice r = t + 1 is perhaps an `overkill', but it is the logical choice in order to ensure that the syndrome failure probability scales with t in the same way as the probability of generating too many errors in b. 2(mw+2n+m+1)  (n-1)(m(2w+1)+3) 2 We now wish to find how many errors accumulate in b 1- . 1- 1- during the course of the computational steps, the ancilla 3 3 preparations, and the interaction between a and b.

IV. CODE COMPARISON

The value of P (eq. (7)) is plotted in fig. 4 as a function of , for various CSS codes with the required properties. In fig. 4 (a) serial syndrome repetition is assumed, and the case n = /2 is plotted. Fig. 4 (b) shows results using parallel syndrome repetition, taking n = 2. It is seen that parallel repetition allows the memory noise to rise by a factor  4, for given P, , at the cost of increased storage and parallelism overheads. In all the cases plotted, storage errors dominate P . The codes are [[7, 1, 3]], [[23, 1, 7]] obtained from the famous Golay code [21], and [[55, 1, 11]] and [[87, 1, 15]] obtained from selfdual double circulant codes with weights divisible by 4 [22]. Note that slightly more efficient (quadratic residue) CSS codes exist [20]. P is the failure probability per qubit per correction. To achieve a computation of Q steps involving K logical qubits, we require P < /KQ. The overhead involved in 6

where the number of levels L  log(N/K)/ log 7. The expression for N/K is from [11], and I estimate T /Q by noting that (1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + . . .)7L-1 Q/ 7-bit recoveries must be carried per logical qubit, if 2 recoveries are carried out per level. Each correction uses two ancillas as in fig. 1, and the syndrome is generated twice, making 4 × 60 elementary operations4 . The degree of parallelism required is approximately 2K7L-1. To compare methods, let us consider the case suggested by Preskill [11], in order that we can use his estimates for concatenated coding. The example case is that of factorising a 130 digit (430 bit) number using Shor's algorithm. This factorisation problem would take a few months on current classical machines with the best known classical algorithm. Shor's algorithm requires K  5 × 430 = 2150 encoded qubits, and of order 109 Toffoli gates, using the circuit of Beckman et. al. [23]. Using Shor's fault-tolerant method [3,11], each Toffoli gate requires about 20 fault-tolerant operations such as xor or state preparation. Therefore we will take Q = 2 × 1010 , and the ancilla factory with [[n, 1, d]] block coding will succeed if P < 2 × 10-14 . Tables 1 and 2 show the error rates and overheads needed to achieve this for various CSS codes. For comparison, the more complete analysis reported by Preskill for the the 7-bit code with three levels of concatenation gives     10-6 , with N  1.3 × 106 qubits [11]. I estimate T  1017 and a required parallelism of order 2 × 105 for this case. Table 1 gives the results when the r syndromes are extracted in series (eq. (5)), and table 2 gives the results when the r syndromes are extracted in parallel (eq. (6)). Examining table 1, we find that the ancilla factory allows the gate error rate with [[55, 1, 11]] block coding to be an order of magnitude larger than the result for concatenated coding quoted by Preskill, but requires the storage

error rate to be an order of magnitude smaller. Since gate errors are liable to be more noisy than free evolution in practice, the block code here compares favourably with the concatenated code. Since the block coding method also has a smaller overhead, the conclusion is that it is the best method in this example. Examining table 2, we find that block coding with parallel syndrome repetition achieves roughly an order of magnitude improvement in the allowed gate error rate, without much change in the store error rate, compared to the concatenated code, with a similar size overhead but smaller time and parallelism. Here again it is the better choice.
V. DISCUSSION

It should be underlined that the comparison in tables 1 and 2 only gives a rough indication of the relative merits of concatenated and block coding, because the analysis I have used is approximate, whereas the results quoted in [11] are based on a more careful computer simulation of the flow of errors through the relevant quantum networks. The present results show that a more thorough comparision would be worthwhile. It would be surprising if such an analysis overturned the overall conclusion, however, since that would require the results here presented to be incorrect by about an order of magnitude. Since my result is essentially P  O((g)t+1 ) this would require my estimate of g (eq. (4)) to be incorrect by an order of magnitude. However, I have been cautious at various points in the calculation, especially in supposing the syndrome repetition r to be on average as large as t + 1, so I expect my results to be cautious rather than over-optimisitic. Zalka [24] has suggested accepting the first syndrome, without repetition, whenever it indicates no errors. Such a method would allow g to be reduced, and therefore  to be increased, by about a factor t. Also, it would probably be safe to increase , the average number of computational steps per correction. Such simple adjustments would probably allow the error rates given in the tables to be improved by about an order of magnitude. Supporting evidence for this statement is obtained by observing that the threshold 0 for 7L -bit concatenated coding in the case of no memory errors ( = 0) is about an order of magnitude larger in Zalka's optimised method [24] than in the corresponding results of Gottesman et. al. [9,11]. Let us now estimate the size of computation for which the 7L concatenated code would be preferable to block coding. With concatenation, when we require more computational steps the overheads N/K and T /Q increase, but the required noise level ,  is roughly unchanged. Let us add one more level of encoding, L = 4, and compare with the [[87, 1, 15]] used with parallel ancillas (table 2). The noise requirements of the two methods become roughly equivalent if we allow  and  for the [[87, 1, 15]]

code to be reduced by a factor of 3 from the values in table 2. The block code then requires 7 times less memory noise, but allows 6 times more gate noise, than the values 10-6 for the concatenated code. Since the block code requires only a third as many qubits, and much smaller time and parallelism, one may argue that it is still the better choice. In any case, the value of P will fall by 38 = 6561, so the computation size can increase by the same factor. This would permit Shor's algorithm on numbers of 9 times more digits, ie a 1170 digit (3890 bit) number. The important point is not in the details, but simply that block coding is the better choice for all the computation we are likely to contemplate. Another consideration is the relative ease of applying computational steps fault-tolerantly with the various codes we have considered. The 7-bit code has the advantage of being simple, and so fault-tolerant operations are relatively easy to find. However, after two or three levels of concatenation some of the fault-tolerant operations become quite complex, especially those requiring preparation of a given state (in encoded form). Block coding is advantageous in this respect. The [[23, 1, 7]] code is obtained from the famous Golay code [21] which is certainly a good choice for fault-tolerant operations because of the many symmetries of the extended Golay code [24, 12, 8]. (for example its weight distribution is A{0,8,12,16,24} = {1, 759, 2576, 759, 1}). An interesting possibility is to concatenate the Golay code with the 7bit code. This would produce a similar correction ability to the 73 concatenated code, but with half the block size. This may well allow the `benchmark' of tables 1 and 2 to be improved upon. An important lesson is that it is not necessary to consider infinite families of codes (such as the Reed Muller codes) when considering the practical possibilities of quantum computation, since the finite set of known codes already contains specimens sufficiently powerful for all the quantum computation we are likely to contemplate.
VI. ANCILLA FACTORY

Entropy is kept under control in quantum computation by the feeding in of low-entropy prepared states. At the most basic level, one can take these low-entropy prepared states to be states of bare qubits. However, Shor's fault-tolerant method made a significant step forward in focussing attention on the low-entropy preparation of entangled states (the so-called `cat' states). The ancilla factory pushes this a stage further. One may wonder whether there is more to be gained by taking another step in the same direction. This would involve preparing well-chosen entangled states of larger ancillas, aiming to reduce the number of ways in which errors can be produced in, or coupled into, each block b during correction. However, unless some radically different approach to quantum error correction can be found, there is little

7

further to be gained in this direction. The reason is that any corrector must gather sufficient information from b to learn the bit and sign errors in all the n bits of b. In order to couple this information out of b into some other system (whether quantum or classical), at least 2n xor gates must operate on b. If on average the number of syndrome repetitions can be r  1 rather than t + 1, which seems likely, then this minimum is achieved by the ancilla factory for all stabilizer codes [12]. The main possibility for further improvements is in the preparation of the ancilla state. Fig. 5 shows a network to prepare a 7-bit ancilla for the [[7, 1, 3]] code using fewer gates than fig. 1. The idea is to take advantage of the structure in the generator, in which not all error propagation routes are open, so that the verifier need not carry out all the parity checks in the [7, 3, 4] check matrix. Similar networks exist for more complicated codes. In this paper I have supposed that the only way the quantum computer can be manipulated is through quantum network methods, ie preparation and measurement of qubits in the {|0 , |1 } basis, and quantum gates. However, other methods may be possible. For example, one could engineer the coupling between each ancilla block ax and its environment in such a way that relaxation would place ax in the desired state |0E + |1E . Any method to realise a `factory' which delivered reliable ancillas could be used to stabilize the quantum computer. Suppose we have a factory which generates the required ancilla states rapidly, but imperfectly. In that case one could use a recursive purification method to obtain ancillas of high fidelity, as shown in fig. 6. This is closely related to the purification method for entangled pairs of qubits which can make quantum cryptography secure [25,26]. The main conclusions of this study are as follows. First, since quantum error correction is essentially a method in which processing is used to fight noise, it is meaningless to specify the noise level which can be tolerated without stating the processing power required. The main parameters of the processing power are the scale-up N/K, the slow-down T /Q, and the degree of parallelism. It makes sense to distinguish the noise level  per gate from the noise per time step  for resting qubits, but it is important to include both contributions. Even when  is a hundred times smaller than , memory errors can still be the dominant source of noise. In previous work I argued that the ancilla factory method is successful because it reduces the operations on the encoded qubits of the computer to a minimum. Here I have further shown that the ancilla state need only be verified against a small subset of the errors it might have; this also is important to the success of the method. The analysis of the error rates and overheads shows that the ancilla factory is the best known method to stabilize quantum computation. Furthermore, block coding is better than concatenated coding using 7L -bit codes. The reason is that the efficiency of block codes more than compensates for the advantage of correcting low-order er8

rors more often than high-order ones, which is the chief advantage of concatenated coding. The best method may be a combined one, in which a more advanced block code such as the Golay code is concatenated with a simple one such as the 7-bit code. In order to use these methods in a real quantum computer, it will be necessary to achieve the correct noise properties, chiefly the property of uncorrelated noise at different times and places. A real computer might use small-scale methods applied to individual physical qubits, combined with quantum coding on a larger scale. The small-scale methods would depend on the physics of the particular system, and their chief aim would be to ensure that the noise left to be corrected through a QECC would have the right properties. I thank the Royal Society and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for their support.

Abstract The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-twentieth century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has lead to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the EPR experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property, and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer is described, based on the Church-Turing Principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a quantum computer of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a quantum computer. To build a universal quantum computer is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high-Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (3 qubits), and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful quantum computer (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC). An introduction to quantum error correction is provided. The evolution of the quantum computer is restricted to a carefully chosen sub-space of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this sub-space. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times. 2

Introduction

The science of physics seeks to ask, and find precise answers to, basic questions about why nature is at it is. Historically, the fundamental principles of physics have been concerned with questions such as "what are things made of?" and "why do things move as they do?" In his Principia, Newton gave very wide-ranging answers to some of these questions. By showing that the same mathamatical equations could describe the motions of everyday objects and of planets, he showed that an everyday object such as a tea pot is made of essentially the same sort of stuff as a planet: the motions of both can be described in terms of their mass and the forces acting on them. Nowadays we would say that both move in such a way as to conserve energy and momentum. In this way, physics allows us to abstract from nature concepts such as energy or momentum which always obey fixed equations, although the same energy might be expressed in many different ways: for example, an electron in the large electronpositron collider at CERN, Geneva, can have the same kinetic energy as a slug on a lettuce leaf. Another thing which can be expressed in many different ways is information. For example, the two statements "the quantum computer is very interesting" and "l'ordinateur quantique est tr`s int´ressant" e e have something in common, although they share no words. The thing they have in common is their information content. Essentially the same information could be expressed in many other ways, for example by substituting numbers for letters in a scheme such as a  97, b  98, c  99 and so on, in which case the english version of the above statement becomes 116 104 101 32 113 117 97 110 116 117 109 . . . . It is very significant that information can be expressed in different ways without losing its essential nature, since this leads to the possibility of the automatic manipulation of information: a machine need only be able to manipulate quite simple things like integers in order to do surprisingly powerful information processing, from document preparation to differential calculus, even to translating between human languages. We are familiar with this now, because of the ubiquitous computer, but even fifty years ago such a widespread significance of automated information processing was not forseen. However, there is one thing that all ways of express5

ing information must have in common: they all use real physical things to do the job. Spoken words are conveyed by air pressure fluctuations, written ones by arrangements of ink molecules on paper, even thoughts depend on neurons. The rallying cry of the information physicist is "no information without physical representation!" Conversely, the fact that information is insensitive to exactly how it is expressed, and can be freely translated from one form to another, makes it an obvious candidate for a fundamentally important role in physics, like energy and momentum and other such abstractions. However, until the second half of this century, the precise mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, was undiscovered, so the significance of information in physics was only hinted at in concepts such as entropy in thermodynamics. It now appears that information may have a much deeper significance. Historically, much of fundamental physics has been concerned with discovering the fundamental particles of nature and the equations which describe their motions and interactions. It now appears that a different programme may be equally important: to discover the ways that nature allows, and prevents, information to be expressed and manipulated, rather than particles to move. For example, the best way to state exactly what can and cannot travel faster than light is to identify information as the speed-limited entity. In quantum mechanics, it is highly significant that the state vector must not contain, whether explicitly or implicitly, more information than can meaningfully be associated with a given system. Among other things this produces the wavefunction symmetry requirements which lead to Bose Einstein and Fermi Dirac statistics, the periodic structure of atoms, and so on. The programme to re-investigate the fundamental principles of physics from the standpoint of information theory is still in its infancy. However, it already appears to be highly fruitful, and it is this ambitious programme that I aim to summarise. Historically, the concept of information in physics does not have a clear-cut origin. However, an important thread can be traced if we consider the paradox of Maxwell's demon of 1871 (fig. 1) (see also Brillouin 1956). Recall that Maxwell's demon is a creature that opens and closes a trap door between two compartments of a chamber containing gas, and pursues the

subversive policy of only opening the door when fast molecules approach it from the right, or slow ones from the left. In this way the demon establishes a temperature difference between the two compartments without doing any work, in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently permitting a host of contradictions. A number of attempts were made to exorcise Maxwell's demon (see Bennett 1987), such as arguments that the demon cannot gather information without doing work, or without disturbing (and thus heating) the gas, both of which are untrue. Some were tempted to propose that the 2nd law of thermodynamics could indeed be violated by the actions of an "intelligent being." It was not until 1929 that Leo Szilard made progress by reducing the problem to its essential components, in which the demon need merely identify whether a single molecule is to the right or left of a sliding partition, and its action allows a simple heat engine, called Szilard's engine, to be run. Szilard still had not solved the problem, since his analysis was unclear about whether or not the act of measurement, whereby the demon learns whether the molecule is to the left or the right, must involve an increase in entropy. A definitive and clear answer was not forthcoming, surprisingly, until a further fifty years had passed. In the intermediate years digital computers were developed, and the physical implications of information gathering and processing were carefully considered. The thermodynamic costs of elementary information manipulations were analysed by Landauer and others during the 1960s (Landauer 1961, Keyes and Landauer 1970), and those of general computations by Bennett, Fredkin, Toffoli and others during the 1970s (Bennett 1973, Toffoli 1980, Fredkin and Toffoli 1982). It was found that almost anything can in principle be done in a reversible manner, ie with no entropy cost at all. Bennett (1982) made explicit the relation between this work and Maxwell's paradox by proposing that the demon can indeed learn where the molecule is in Szilard's engine without doing any work or increasing any entropy in the environment, and so obtain useful work during one stroke of the engine. However, the information about the molecule's location must then be present in the demon's memory (fig. 1). As more and more strokes are performed, more and more information gathers in the demon's memory. To complete a thermodynamic cy-

cle, the demon must erase its memory, and it is during this erasure operation that we identify an increase in entropy in the environment, as required by the 2nd law. This completes the essential physics of Maxwell's demon; further subtleties are discussed by Caves (1990), and Caves, Unruh and Zurek (1990). The thread we just followed was instructive, but to provide a complete history of ideas relevent to quantum computing is a formidable task. Our subject brings together what are arguably two of the greatest revolutions in twentieth-century science, namely quantum mechanics and information science (including computer science). The relationship between these two giants is illustrated in fig. 2. Classical information theory is founded on the definition of information. However, a warning is in order here. Whereas the theory tries to capture much of the normal meaning of the term `information', it can no more do justice to the full richness of that term in everyday language than particle physics can encapsulate the everyday meaning of `charm'. `Information' for us will be an abstract term, defined in detail in section 2.1. Much of information theory dates back to seminal work of Shannon in the 1940's (Slepian 1974). The observation that information can be translated from one form to another is encapsulated and quantified in Shannon's noiseless coding theorem (1948), which quantifies the resources needed to store or transmit a given body of information. Shannon also considered the fundamentally important problem of communication in the presence of noise, and established Shannon's main theorem (section 2.4) which is the central result of classical information theory. Error-free communication even in the presence of noise is achieved by means of `error-correcting codes', and their study is a branch of mathematics in its own right. Indeed, the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Theory is almost totally taken up with the discovery and analysis of error-correction by coding. Pioneering work in this area was done by Golay (1949) and Hamming (1950). The foundations of computer science were formulated at roughly the same time as Shannon's information theory, and this is no coincidence. The father of computer science is arguably Alan Turing (1912-1954), and its prophet is Charles Babbage (1791-1871). Babbage conceived of most of the essential elements of a mod-

6

ern computer, though in his day there was not the technology available to implement his ideas. A century passed before Babbage's Analytical Engine was improved upon when Turing described the Universal Turing Machine in the mid 1930s. Turing's genius (see Hodges 1983) was to clarify exactly what a calculating machine might be capable of, and to emphasise the role of programming, ie software, even more than Babbage had done. The giants on whose shoulders Turing stood in order to get a better view were chiefly the mathematicians David Hilbert and Kurt G¨del. Hilbert had o emphasised between the 1890s and 1930s the importance of asking fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics. Instead of asking "is this mathematical proposition true?" Hilbert wanted to ask "is it the case that every mathematical proposition can in principle be proved or disproved?" This was unknown, but Hilbert's feeling, and that of most mathematicians, was that mathematics was indeed complete, so that conjectures such as Goldbach's (that every even number can be written as the sum of two primes) could be proved or disproved somehow, although the logical steps might be as yet undiscovered.

cated mathematical questions, but sufficiently simple to be subject to detailed analysis. Turing used his machine as a theoretical construct to show that the assumed existence of a mechanical means to establish decidability leads to a contradiction. In other words, he was initially concerned with quite abstract mathematics rather than practical computation. However, by seriously establishing the idea of automating abstract mathematical proofs rather than merely arithmatic, Turing greatly stimulated the development of general purpose information processing. This was in the days when a "computer" was a person doing mathematics.

Modern computers are neither Turing machines nor Babbage engines, though they are based on broadly similar principles, and their computational power is equivalent (in a technical sense) to that of a Turing machine. I will not trace their development here, since although this is a wonderful story, it would take too long to do justice to the many people involved. Let us just remark that all of this development represents a great improvement in speed and size, but does not involve any change in the essential idea of what a comG¨del destroyed this hope by establishing the existence puter is, or how it operates. Quantum mechanics raises o of mathematical propositions which were undecidable, the possibility of such a change, however. meaning that they could be neither proved not disproved.

conceivable under quantum mechanical rules. The first deep insight into quantum information theory came with Bell's 1964 analysis of the paradoxical thought-experiment proposed by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) in 1935. Bell's inequality draws attention to the importance of correlations between separated quantum systems which have interacted (directly or indirectly) in the past, but which no longer influence one another. In essence his argument shows that the degree of correlation which can be present in such systems exceeds that which could be predicted on the basis of any law of physics which describes particles in terms of classical variables rather than quantum states. Bell's argument was clarified by Bohm (1951, also Bohm and Aharonov 1957) and by Clauser, Holt, Horne and Shimony (1969), and experimental tests were carried out in the 1970s (Clauser and Shimony 1978). Improvements in such experiments are largely concerned with preventing the possibility of any interaction between the separated quantum systems, and a significant step forward was made in the experiment of Aspect, Dalibard and Roger (1982), (see also Aspect 1991) since in their work any purported interaction would have either to travel faster than light, or possess other almost equally implausible qualities. The next link between quantum mechanics and information theory came about when it was realised that simple properties of quantum systems, such as the unavoidable disturbance involved in measurement, could be put to practical use, in quantum cryptography (Wiesner 1983, Bennett et. al. 1982, Bennett and Brassard 1984, 1985). This is an ingenious method in which transmitted quantum states are used to perform a very particular communication task: to establish at two separated locations a pair of identical, but otherwise random, sequences of binary numbers, without allowing any third party to learn the sequence. This is very useful because such a random sequence can be used as a cryptographic key to permit secure communication. The significant feature is that the principles of quantum mechanics guarantee a type of conservation of quantum information, so that if the necessary quantum information arrives at the parties wishing to establish a random key, they can be sure it has not gone elsewhere, such as to a spy. Thus the whole problem of compromised keys, which fills the annals of espionage, is avoided by taking advantage of the structure of the

natural world. While quantum cryptography was being analysed and demonstrated, the quantum computer was undergoing a quiet birth. Since quantum mechanics underlies the behaviour of all systems, including those we call classical ("even a screwdriver is quantum mechanical", Landauer (1997)), it was not obvious how to conceive of a distinctively quantum mechanical computer, ie one which did not merely reproduce the action of a classical Turing machine. Obviously it is not sufficient merely to identify a quantum mechanical system whose evolution could be interpreted as a computation; one must prove a much stronger result than this. Conversely, we know that classical computers can simulate, by their computations, the evolution of any quantum system . . . with one reservation: no classical process will allow one to prepare separated systems whose correlations break the Bell inequality. It appears from this that the EPR-Bell correlations are the quintessential quantummechanical property (Feynman 1982). In order to think about computation from a quantummechanical point of view, the first ideas involved converting the action of a Turing machine into an equivalent reversible process, and then inventing a Hamiltonian which would cause a quantum system to evolve in a way which mimicked a reversible Turing machine. This depended on the work of Bennett (1973; see also Lecerf 1963) who had shown that a universal classical computing machine (such as Turing's) could be made reversible while retaining its simplicity. Benioff (1980, 1982) and others proposed such Turing-like Hamiltonians in the early 1980s. Although Benioff's ideas did not allow the full analysis of quantum computation, they showed that unitary quantum evolution is at least as powerful computationally as a classical computer. A different approach was taken by Feynman (1982, 1986) who considered the possibility not of universal computation, but of universal simulation--ie a purpose-built quantum system which could simulate the physical behaviour of any other. Clearly, such a simulator would be a universal computer too, since any computer must be a physical system. Feynman gave arguments which suggested that quantum evolution could be used to compute certain problems more efficiently than any classical computer, but his device was not sufficiently specified to be called a computer,

9

measured as the minimum number of two-state systems, now called quantum bits or qubits, which would be needed to store or transmit the system's state with high accuracy. Let us return to the question of realisability of quantum computation. It is an elementary, but fundamentally important, observation that the quantum interference effects which permit algorithms such as Shor's are extremely fragile: the quantum computer is ultrasensitive to experimental noise and impression. It is not true that early workers were unaware of this difficulty, but rather their first aim was to establish whether a quantum computer had any fundamental significance at all. Armed with Shor's algorithm, it now appears that such a fundamental significance is established, by the following argument: either nature does allow a device to be run with sufficient precision to perform Shor's algorithm for large integers (greater than, say, a googol, 10100 ), or there are fundamental natural limits to precision in real systems. Both eventualities represent an important insight into the laws of nature. At this point, ideas of quantum information and quantum computing come together. For, a quantum computer can be made much less sensitive to noise by means of a new idea which comes directly from the marriage of quantum mechanics with classical information theory, namely quantum error correction. Although the phrase `error correction' is a natural one and was used with reference to quantum computers prior to 1996, it was only in that year that two important papers, of Calderbank and Shor, and independently Steane, established a general framework whereby quantum information processing can be used to combat a very wide class of noise processes in a properly designed quantum system. Much progress has since been made in generalising these ideas (Knill and Laflamme 1997, Ekert and Macchiavello 1996, Bennett et. al. 1996, Gottesman 1996, Calderbank et. al. 1997). An important development was the demonstration by Shor (1996) and Kitaev (1996) that correction can be achieved even when the corrective operations are themselves imperfect. Such methods lead to a general concept of `fault tolerant' computing, of which a helpful review is provided by Preskill (1997).

only work in conjunction with quantum error correction, it appears that the relationship between quantum information theory and quantum computers is even more intimate than that between Shannon's information theory and classical computers. Error correction does not in itself guarantee accurate quantum computation, since it cannot combat all types of noise, but the fact that it is possible at all is a significant development. A computer which only exists on paper will not actually perform any computations, and in the end the only way to resolve the issue of feasibility in quantum computer science is to build a quantum computer. To this end, a number of authors proposed computer designs based on Deutsch's idea, but with the physical details more fully worked out (Teich et. al. 1988, Lloyd 1993, DiVincenco 1995). The great challenge is to find a sufficiently complex system whose evolution is nevertheless both coherent (ie unitary) and controlable. It is not sufficient that only some aspects of a system should be quantum mechanical, as in solid-state `quantum dots', or that there is an implicit assumption of unfeasible precision or cooling, which is often the case for proposals using solid-state devices. Cirac and Zoller (1995) proposed the use of a linear ion trap, which was a significant improvement in feasibility, since heroic efforts in the ion trapping community had already achieved the necessary precision and low temperature in experimental work, especially the group of Wineland who demonstrated cooling to the ground state of an ion trap in the same year (Diedrich et. al. 1989, Monroe et. al. 1995). More recently, Gershenfeld and Chuang (1997) and Cory et. al. (1996) have shown that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques can be adapted to fulfill the requirements of quantum computation, making this approach also very promising.

As things stand, no quantum computer has been built, nor looks likely to be built in the author's lifetime, if we measure it in terms of Shor's algorithm, and ask for factoring of large numbers. However, if we ask instead for a device in which quantum information ideas can be explored, then only a few quantum bits are required, and this will certainly be achieved in the near future. Simple two-bit operations have been carried out in many physics experiments, notably magnetic resonance, and work with three to ten qubits now seems feasible. NoIf, as seems almost certain, quantum computation will table recent experiments in this regard are those of

Classical information theory

This and the next section will summarise the classical theory of information and computing. This is textbook material (Minsky 1972, Hamming 1980) but is included here since it forms a background to quantum information and computing, and the article is aimed at physicists to whom the ideas may be new.

If X can take N different values, then the information content (or entropy) of X is maximised when the probability distribution p is flat, with every p(x) = 1/N (for example a fair die yields S  2.58, but a loaded die with p(6) = 1/2, p(1 · · · 5) = 1/10 yields S  2.16). This is consistent with the requirement that the information (what we would gain if we learned X) is maximum when our prior knowledge of X is minimum. Thus the maximum information which could in principle be stored by a variable which can take on N different values is log2 (N ). The logarithms are taken to base 2 rather than some other base by convention. The choice dictates the unit of information: S(X) = 1 when X can take two values with equal probability. A twovalued or binary variable thus can contain one unit of information. This unit is called a bit. The two values of a bit are typically written as the binary digits 0 and 1. In the case of a binary variable, we can define p to be the probability that X = 1, then the probability that X = 0 is 1 - p and the information can be written as a function of p alone: H(p) = -p log2 p - (1 - p) log2 (1 - p) (2)

Measures of information

This function is called the entropy function, 0  H(p)  1. If X is a random variable which has value x with probability p(x), then the information content of X is defined In what follows, the subscript 2 will be dropped on to be logarithms, it is assumed that all logarithms are to S({p(x)}) = - p(x) log2 p(x). (1) base 2 unless otherwise indicated.
x

The most basic problem in classical information theory is to obtain a measure of information, that is, of amount of information. Suppose I tell you the value of a number X. How much information have you gained? That will depend on what you already knew about X. For example, if you already knew X was equal to 2, you would learn nothing, no information, from my revelation. On the other hand, if previously your only knowledge was that X was given by the throw of a die, then to learn its value is to gain information. We have met here a basic paradoxical property, which is that information is often a measure of ignorance: the information content (or `self-information') of X is defined to be the information you would gain if you learned the value of X.

Note that the logarithm is taken to base 2, and that S is always positive since probabilities are bounded by p(x)  1. S is a function of the probability distribition of values of X. It is important to remember this, since in what follows we will adopt the standard practice of using the notation S(X) for S({p(x)}). It is understood that S(X) does not mean a function of X, but rather the information content of the variable X. The quantity S(X) is also referred to as an entropy, for obvious reasons.

The probability that Y = y given that X = x is written p(y|x). The conditional entropy S(Y |X) is defined by S(Y |X) = = - - p(x)

We will measure the information conp(x, y) I(X : Y ) = p(x, y) log (5) tent of X by counting how many bits Alice must send, p(x)p(y) on average, to allow Bob to learn X. Obviously, she x y = S(X) - S(X|Y ) (6) could just send 0 for `no' and 1 for `yes', giving a `bit rate' of one bit per X value communicated. However, From the definition, I(X : Y ) is a measure of how what if X were an essentially random variable, except much X and Y contain information about each other1 . that it is more likely to be `no' than `yes' ?

Data compression

Having pulled the definition of information content, equation (1), out of a hat, our aim is now to prove that this is a good measure of information. It is not obvious at first sight even how to think about such a task. One of the main contributions of classical information theory is to provide useful ways to think about information. We will describe a simple situation in order to illustrate the methods. Let us suppose one person, traditionally called Alice, knows the value of X, and she wishes to communicate it to Bob. We restrict ourselves to the simple case that X has only two
1 Many authors write I(X; Y ) rather than I(X : Y ). I prefer the latter since the symmetry of the colon reflects the fact that I(X : Y ) = I(Y : X).

Now, it can be shown that the probability that Alice's n values actually form a typical sequence is greater than 1 - , for sufficiently large n, no matter how small  is. This implies that Alice need not communicate n bits to Bob in order for him to learn n decisions. She need only tell Bob which typical sequence she has. They must agree together beforehand how the typical sequences are to be labelled: for example, they may agree to number them in order of increasing binary value. Alice just sends the label, not the sequence itself. To deduce how well this works, it can be shown that the typical sequences all have equal probability, and there are 2nH(p) of them. To communicate one of 2nH(p) possibilities, clealy Alice must send nH(p) bits. Also, Alice cannot do better than this (i.e. send fewer bits) since the typical sequences are equiprobable: there is nothing to be gained by further manipu-

The above argument has already yielded a significant practical result associated with (1). This is that to communicate n values of X, we need only send nS(X)  n bits down a communication channel. This idea is referred to as data compression, and is also called Shannon's noiseless coding theorem. The typical sequences idea has given a means to calculate information content, but it is not the best way to compress information in practice, because Alice must wait for a large number of decisions to accumulate before she communicates anything to Bob. A better method is for Alice to accumulate a few decisions, say 4, and communicate this as a single `message' as best she can. Huffman derived an optimal method whereby Alice sends short strings to communicate the most likely messages, and longer ones to communicate the least likely messages, see table 1 for an example. The translation process is referred to as `encoding' and `decoding' (fig. 4); this terminology does not imply any wish to keep information secret.

2.3

The binary symmetric channel

So far we have considered the case of communication down a perfect, i.e. noise-free channel. We have gained two main results of practical value: a measure of the best possible data compression (Shannon's noiseless coding theorem), and a practical method to compress data (Huffman coding). We now turn to the important question of communication in the presence of noise. As in the last section, we will analyse the simplest case in order to illustrate principles which are in fact more general. Suppose we have a binary channel, i.e. one which allows Alice to send noughts and ones to Bob. The noisefree channel conveys 0  0 and 1  1, but a noisy channel might sometimes cause 0 to become 1 and vice versa. There is an infinite variety of different types of noise. For example, the erroneous `bit flip' 0  1 might be just as likely as 1  0, or the channel might have a tendency to `relax' towards 0, in which case 1  0 happens but 0  1 does not. Also, such errors might occur independently from bit to bit, or occur in bursts.

For the case p = 1/4 Shannon's noiseless coding theorem tells us that the best possible data compression technique would communicate each message of four X A very important type of noise is one which affects values by sending on average 4H(1/4)  3.245 bits. different bits independently (i.e. not like the one we 14

just considered which affected pairs of bits), and causes both 0  1 and 1  0 errors. This is important because it captures the essential features of many processes encountered in realistic situations. If the two errors 0  1 and 1  0 are equally likely, then the noisy channel is called a `binary symmetric channel'. The binary symmetric channel has a single parameter, p, which is the error probability per bit sent. Suppose the message sent into the channel by Alice is X, and the noisy message which Bob receives is Y . Bob is then faced with the task of deducing X as best he can from Y . If X consists of a single bit, then Bob will make use of the conditional probabilities p(x = 0|y = 0) = p(x = 1|y = 1) = 1 - p p(x = 0|y = 1) = p(x = 1|y = 0) = p giving S(X|Y ) = H(p) using equations (3) and (2). Therefore, from the definition (6) of mutual information, we have I(X : Y ) = S(X) - H(p) (13)

information theory, but fortunately this case is quite simple. From equations (13) and (14) one may see that the answer is C(p) = 1 - H(p), (15)

obtained when S(X) = 1 (i.e. P (x = 0) = P (x = 1) = 1/2).

2.4

Error-correcting codes

We will need the following concepts. The set {0, 1} is considered as a group (a Galois field GF(2)) where the operations +, -, ×, ÷ are carried out modulo 2 (thus, 1 + 1 = 0). An n-bit binary word is a vector of n components, for example 011 is the vector (0, 1, 1). A set of such vectors forms a vector space under addition, since for example 011 + 101 means (0, 1, 1) + (1, 0, 1) = (0+1, 1+0, 1+1) = (1, 1, 0) = 110 by the standard rules of vector addition. This is equivalent to the exclusiveChannel capacity C  max I(X : Y ) (14) or operation carried out bitwise between the two binary {p(x)} words. Channel capacity is measured in units of `bits out per symbol in' and for binary channels must lie between The effect of noise on a word u can be expressed u  u = u + e, where the error vector e indicates which zero and one. bits in u were flipped by the noise. For example, u = 1001101  u = 1101110 can be expressed u = u + It is all very well to have a definition, but (14) does not allow us to compare channels very easily, since we 0100011. An error correcting code C is a set of words have to perform the maximisation over input strategies, such that which is non-trivial. To establish the capacity C(p) of u + e = v + f u, v  C (u = v), e, f  E (16) the binary symmetric channel is a basic problem in 15

Clearly, the presence of noise in the channel limits the information about Alice's X contained in Bob's received Y . Also, because of the data processing inequality, equation (7), Bob cannot increase his information about X by manipulating Y . However, (13) shows that Alice and Bob can communicate better if S(X) is large. The general insight is that the information communicated depends both on the source and the properties of the channel. It would be useful to have a measure of the channel alone, to tell us how well it conveys information. This quantity is called the capacity of the channel and it is defined to be the maximum possible mutual information I(X : Y ) between the input and output of the channel, maximised over all possible sources:

So far we have investigated how much information gets through a noisy channel, and how much is lost. Alice cannot convey to Bob more information than C(p) per symbol communicated. However, suppose Bob is busy defusing a bomb and Alice is shouting from a distance which wire to cut : she will not say "the blue wire" just once, and hope that Bob heard correctly. She will repeat the message many times, and Bob will wait until he is sure to have got it right. Thus error-free communication can be achieved even over a noisy channel. In this example one obtains the benefit of reduced error rate at the sacrifice of reduced information rate. The next stage of our information theoretic programme is to identify more powerful techniques to circumvent noise (Hamming 1980, Hill 1986, MacWilliams and Sloane 1977).

where E is the set of errors correctable by C, which includes the case of no error, e = 0. To use such a code, Alice and Bob agree on which codeword u corresponds to which message, and Alice only ever sends codewords down the channel. Since the channel is noisy, Bob receives not u but u + e. However, Bob can deduce u unambiguously from u + e since by condition (16), no other codeword v sent by Alice could have caused Bob to receive u + e.

surprising, since it implies that it is not necessary to engineer very low-noise communication channels, an expensive and difficult task. Instead, we can compensate noise by error correction coding and decoding, that is, by information processing! The meaning of Shannon's theorem is illustrated by fig. 5. The main problem of coding theory is to identify codes with large rate k/n and large distance d. These two conditions are mutually incompatible, so a compromise is needed. The problem is notoriously difficult and has no general solution. To make connection with quantum error correction, we will need to mention one important concept, that of the parity check matrix. An error correcting code is called linear if it is closed under addition, i.e. u + v  C u, v  C. Such a code is completely specified by its parity check matrix H, which is a set of (n - k) n-bit words satisfying H · u = 0 u  C. The important property is encapsulated by the following equation:

An example error-correcting code is shown in the righthand column of table 1. This is a [7, 4, 3] Hamming code, named after its discoverer. The notation [n, k, d] means that the codewords are n bits long, there are 2k of them, and they all differ from each other in at least d places. Because of the latter feature, the condition (16) is satisfied for any error which affects at most one bit. In other words the set E of correctable errors is {0000000,1000000,0100000,0010000, 0001000,0000100,0000010, 0000001}. Note that E can have at most 2n-k members. The ratio k/n is called H · (u + e) = (H · u) + (H · e) = H · e. (17) the rate of the code, since each block of n transmitted bits conveys k bits of information, thus k/n bits per This states that if Bob evaluates H · u for his noisy received word u = u + e, he will obtain the same answer bit. H · e, no matter what word u Alice sent him! If this The parameter d is called the `minimum distance' of evaluation were done automatically, Bob could learn the code, and is important when encoding for noise H · e, called the error syndrome, without learning u. If which affects successive bits independently, as in the Bob can deduce the error e from H · e, which one can binary symmetric channel. For, a code of minumum show is possible for all correctable errors, then he can distance d can correct all errors affecting less than d/2 correct the message (by subtracting e from it) without bits of the transmitted codeword, and for independent ever learning what it was! In quantum error correcnoise this is the most likely set of errors. In fact, the tion, this is the origin of the reason one can correct a probability that an n-bit word receives m errors is given quantum state without disturbing it. by the binomial distribution (11), so if the code can correct more than the mean number of errors np, the correction is highly likely to succeed.

3

The central result of classical information theory is that powerful error correcting codes exist: Shannon's theorem: If the rate k/n < C(p) and n is sufficiently large, there exists a binary code allowing transmission with an arbitrarily small error probability.

Classical theory of computation

We now turn to the theory of computation. This is mostly concerned with the questions "what is computable?" and "what resources are necessary?"

The fundamental resources required for computing are a means to store and to manipulate symbols. The important questions are such things as how complicated The error probability here is the probability that an must the symbols be, how many will we need, how comuncorrectable error occurs, causing Bob to misinter- plicated must the manipulations be, and how many of pret the received word. Shannon's theorem is highly them will we need? 16

The general insight is that computation is deemed hard or inefficient if the amount of resources required rises exponentially with a measure of the size of the problem to be addressed. The size of the problem is given by the amount of information required to specify the problem. Applying this idea at the most basic level, we find that a computer must be able to manipulate binary symbols, not just unary symbols2 , otherwise the number of memory locations needed would grow exponentially with the amount of information to be manipulated. On the other hand, it is not necessary to work in decimal notation (10 symbols) or any other notation with an `alphabet' of more than two symbols. This greatly simplifies computer design and analysis. To manipulate n binary symbols, it is not necessary to manipulate them all at once, since it can be shown that any transformation can be brought about by manipulating the binary symbols one at a time or in pairs. A binary `logic gate' takes two bits x, y as inputs, and calculates a function f (x, y). Since f can be 0 or 1, and there are four possible inputs, there are 16 possible functions f . This set of 16 different logic gates is called a `universal set', since by combining such gates in series, any transformation of n bits can be carried out. Futhermore, the action of some of the 16 gates can be reproduced by combining others, so we do not need all 16, and in fact only one, the nand gate, is necessary (nand is not and, for which the output is 0 if and only if both inputs are 1).

construct a universal computer, which can simulate the action of any other, in the following sense. Let us write T (x) for the output of a Turing machine T (fig. 7) acting on input tape x. Now, a Turing machine can be completely specified by writing down how it responds to 0 and 1 on the input tape, for every possible internal configuration of the machine (of which there are a finite number). This specification can itself be written as a binary number d[T ]. Turing showed that there exists a machine U , called a universal Turing machine, with the properties U (d[T ], x) = T (x) (18)

and the number of steps taken by U to simulate each step of T is only a polynomial (not exponential) function of the length of d[T ]. In other words, if we provide U with an input tape containing both a description of T and the input x, then U will compute the same function as T would have done, for any machine T , without an exponential slow-down.

To complete the argument, it can be shown that other models of computation, such as the network model, are computationally equivalent to the Turing model: they permit the same functions to be computed, with the same computational efficiency (see next section). Thus the concept of the univeral machine establishes that a certain finite degree of complexity of construction is sufficient to allow very general information processing. This is the fundamental result of computer science. InBy concatenating logic gates, we can manipulate n-bit deed, the power of the Turing machine and its cousins is symbols (see fig. 6). This general approach is called so great that Church (1936) and Turing (1936) framed the network model of computation, and is useful for the "Church-Turing hypothesis," to the effect that our purposes because it suggests the model of quantum computation which is currently most feasible ex- Every function `which would naturally be regarded as perimentally.

3.2

Computational complexity

Once we have established the idea of a universal computer, computational tasks can be classified in terms of their difficulty in the following manner. A given algorithm is deemed to address not just one instance of a problem, such as "find the square of 237," but one class of problem, such as "given x, find its square." The amount of information given to the computer in order to specify the problem is L = log x, i.e. the number of bits needed to store the value of x. The computational complexity is determined by the number of steps s a Turing machine must make in order to complete the algorithm, or equivalently by the number of logic gates required in the network model. If s is any polynomial function of L (eg s  L3 + L) then the algorithm is deemed tractable and is placed in the complexity class "p". If s rises exponentially with l (eg s  2L = x) then the algorithm is hard and is in another complexity class such as "np". The point is that the membership of these classes does not depend on the model of computation, i.e. the physical realisation of the computer, since the Turing machine can simulate any other computer with only a polynomial, rather than exponential slow-down. An important example of an intractable problem is that of factorisation: given a composite (i.e. nonprime) number x, the task is to find one of its factors. If x is even, or a multiple of any small number, then it is easy to find a factor. The interesting case is when the prime factors of x are all themselves large. In this case there is no known simple method. The best known method, the number field sieve (Menezes et. al. 1997) requires a number of computational steps of order s  exp(2L1/3 (log L)2/3 ) where L = ln x. By devoting a substantial machine network to this task, one can today factor a number of 130 decimal digits (Crandall 1997), i.e. L  300, giving s  1018 . This is time-consuming but possible (for example 42 days at 1012 operations per second). However, if we double L, s increases to  1025 , so now the problem is intractable: it would take a million years with current technology, or would require computers running a million times faster than current ones, which is almost equally implausible. The lesson is an important one: a computationally `hard' problem is one which in practice is not merely difficult but impossible to solve.

The factorisation problem has acquired great practical importance because it is at the heart of widely used cyptographic systems such as that of Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (1979) (see Hellman 1979). For, given a message M (in the form of a long binary number), it is easy to calculate an encrypted version E = M s mod c where s and c are well-chosen large integers which can be made public. To decrypt the message, the receiver calculates E t mod c which is equal to M for a value of t which can be quickly deduced from s and the factors of c (Schroeder 1984). In practice c = pq is chosen to be the product of two large primes p, q known only to the user who published c, so only that user can read the messages--unless someone manages to factorise c. It is a very useful feature that no secret keys need be distributed in such a system: the `key' c, s allowing encryption is public knowledge.

3.3

Incomputable functions

There is an even stronger way in which a task may be impossible for a computer. In the quest to solve some problem, we could `live with' a slow algorithm, but what if one does not exist at all? Such problems are termed incomputable. The most important example is the "halting problem", a rather beautiful result. A feature of computers familiar to programmers is that they may sometimes be thrown into a never-ending loop. Consider, for example, the instruction "while x > 2, divide x by 1" for x initially greater than 2. We can see that this algorithm will never halt, without actually running it. More interesting from a mathematical point of view is an algorithm such as "while x is equal to the sum of two primes, add 2 to x, otherwise print x and halt", beginning at x = 8. The algorithm is certainly feasible since all pairs of primes less than x can be found and added systematically. Will such an algorithm ever halt? If so, then a counterexample to the Goldbach conjecture exists. Using such techniques, a vast section of mathematical and physical theory could be reduced to the question "would such and such an algorithm halt if we were to run it?" If we could find a general way to establish whether or not algorithms will halt, we would have an extremely powerful mathematical tool. In a certain sense, it would solve all of mathematics! Let us suppose that it is possible to find a general algo-

18

rithm which will work out whether any Turing machine will halt on any input. Such an algorithm solves the problem "given x and d[T ], would Turing machine T halt if it were fed x as input?". Here d[T ] is the description of T . If such an algorithm exists, then it is possible to make a Turing machine TH which halts if and only if T (d[T ]) does not halt, where d[T ] is the description of T . Here TH takes as input d[T ], which is sufficient to tell TH about both the Turing machine T and the input to T . Hence we have TH (d[T ]) halts  T (d[T ]) does not halt (19)

So far everything is ok. However, what if we feed TH the description of itself, d[TH ]? Then TH (d[TH ]) halts  TH (d[TH ]) does not halt (20) which is a contradiction. By this argument Turing showed that there is no automatic means to establish whether Turing machines will halt in general: the "halting problem" is incomputable. This implies that mathematics, and information processing in general, is a rich body of different ideas which cannot all be summarised in one grand algorithm. This liberating observation is closely related to G¨del's theorem. o

The obvious, if somewhat imprecise, questions are 1. "can Nature usefully be regarded as essentially an information processor?" 2. "could a computer simulate the whole of Nature?" The fourth postulate, which has not been made explicit, is a subject of some debate, since quite different interpretive approaches lead to the same predictions, and the concept of `measurement' is fraught with ambiguities in quantum mechanics (Wheeler and Zurek 1983, Bell 1987, Peres 1993). A statement which is valid for most practical purposes is that certain physical interactions are recognisably `measurements', and their effect on the state vector | is to change it to an eigenstate |k of the variable being measured, the value of k being randomly chosen with probability P  | k | |2 . The change |  |k can be expressed by the projection operator (|k k|)/ k | . The principles of quantum mechanics suggest that the answer to the first quesion is yes3 . For, the state vector | so central to quantum mechanics is a concept very much like those of information science: it is an abstract entity which contains exactly all the information about the system Q. The word `exactly' here is a reminder that not only is | a complete description of Q, it is also one that does not contain any extraneous information which can not meaningfully be associated with Q. The importance of this in quantum statistics of Fermi and Bose gases was mentioned in the introduction.

of physics, Every finitely realizible physical system can be simulated arbitrarily closely by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means. This statement is based on that of Deutsch (1985). The idea is to propose that a principle like this is not derived from quantum mechanics, but rather underpins it, like other principles such as that of conservation of energy. The qualifications introduced by `finitely realizible' and `finite means' are important in order to state something useful. The new version of the Church-Turing hypothesis (now called the `Church-Turing Principle') does not refer to Turing machines. This is important because there are fundamental differences between the very nature of the Turing machine and the principles of quantum mechanics. One is described in terms of operations on classical bits, the other in terms of evolution of quantum states. Hence there is the possibility that the universal Turing machine, and hence all classical computers, might not be able to simulate some of the behaviour to be found in Nature. Conversely, it may be physically possible (ie not ruled out by the laws of Nature) to realise a new type of computation essentially different from that of classical computer science. This is the central aim of quantum computing.

particles are prepared initially in the singlet state  (| | - | | )/ 2, and they subsequently fly apart, propagating in opposite directions along the y-axis. Alice and Bob are widely separated, and they receive particle A and B respectively. EPR were concerned with whether quantum mechanics provides a complete description of the particles, or whether something was left out, some property of the spin angular momenta sA , sB which quantum theory failed to describe. Such a property has since become known as a `hidden variable'. They argued that something was left out, because this experiment allows one to predict with certainty the result of measuring any component of sB , without causing any disturbance of B. Therefore all the components of sB have definite values, say EPR, and the quantum theory only provides an incomplete description. To make the certain prediction without disturbing B, one chooses any axis  along which one wishes to know B's angular momentum, and then measures not B but A, using a Stern-Gerlach apparatus aligned along . Since the singlet state carries no net angular momentum, one can be sure that the corresponding measurement on B would yield the opposite result to the one obtained for A.

The EPR paper is important because it is carefully argued, and the fallacy is hard to unearth. The fallacy can be exposed in one of two ways: one can say either that Alice's measurement does influence Bob's particle, or (which I prefer) that the quantum state vector | is not an intrinsic property of a quantum system, but an expression for the information content of a quantum 4.1 EPR paradox, Bell's inequality variable. In a singlet state there is mutual information between A and B, so the information content of In 1935 Einstein, Podolski and Rosen (EPR) drew B changes when we learn something about A.

Feynman (1982) gives a particularly clear analysis. At A - B = 120 the highest correlation which local hidden variables could produce is 2/3.

these all act on a single qubit, and can be achieved by the action of some Hamiltonian in Schr¨dinger's equao tion, since they are all unitary operators4 . There are an infinite number of single-qubit quantum gates, in contrast to classical information theory, where only two logic gates are possible for a single bit, namely the identity and the logical not operation. The quantum not gate carries |0 to |1 and vice versa, and so is analagous to a classical not. This gate is also called X since it is the Pauli x operator. Note that the set {I, X, Y, Z} is a group under multiplication. Of all the possible unitary operators acting on a pair of qubits, an interesting subset is those which can be written |0 0|I+|1 1|U , where I is the single-qubit identity operation, and U is some other single-qubit gate. Such a two-qubit gate is called a "controlled U " gate, since the action I or U on the second qubit is controlled by whether the first qubit is in the state |0 or |1 . For example, the effect of controlled-not ("cnot") is |00 |01  |00  |01 (28)

3-qubit "controlled-controlled-not" gate, in which the third qubit experiences not if and only if both the others are in the state |1 . This gate is named a Toffoli gate, after Toffoli (1980) who showed that the classical version is universal for classical computation. The effect on a state |a |b |0 is a  a, b  b, 0  a · b. In other words if the third qubit is prepared in |0 then this gate computes the and of the first two qubits. The use of three qubits is necessary in order to permit the whole operation to be unitary, and thus allowed in quantum mechanical evolution. It is an amusing excercise to find the combinations of gates which perform elementary arithmatical operations such as binary addition and multiplication. Many basic constructions are given by Barenco et. al. (1995), further general design considerations are discussed by Vedral et. al. (1996) and Beckman et. al. (1996). The action of a sequence of quantum gates can be written in operator notation, for example X1 H2 xor1,3 | where | is some state of three qubits, and the subscripts on the operators indicate to which qubits they apply. However, once more than a few quantum gates are involved, this notation is rather obscure, and can usefully be replaced by a diagram known as a quantum network--see fig. 8. These diagrams will be used hereafter.

5.3

No cloning

|10 |11

 |11  |10

No cloning theorem: An unknown quantum state cannot be cloned. This states that it is impossible to generate copies of a quantum state reliably, unless the state is already known (ie unless there exists classical information which specifies it). Proof: to generate a copy of a quantum state | , we must cause a pair of quantum systems to undergo the evolution U (| |0 ) = | | where U is the unitary evolution operator. If this is to work for any state, then U must not depend on , and therefore U (| |0 ) = | | for | = | . How ever, if we consider the state | = (| + | )/ 2, we  have U (| |0 ) = (| | + | | )/ 2 = | | so the cloning operation fails. This argument applies to any purported cloning method (Wooters and Zurek 1982, Dieks 1982).

Here the second qubit undergoes a not if and only if the first qubit is in the state |1 . This list of state changes is the analogue of the truth table for a classical binary logic gate. The effect of controlled-not acting on a state |a |b can be written a  a, b  ab, where  signifies the exclusive or (xor) operation. For this reason, this gate is also called the xor gate. Other logical operations require further qubits. For example, the and operation is achieved by use of the
4 The letter H is adopted for the final gate here because its effect is a Hadamard transformation. This is not to be confused with the Hamiltonian H.

23

Note that any given `cloning' operation U can work on some states (| and | in the above example), though since U is trace-preserving, two different clonable states must be orthogonal, |  = 0. Unless we already know that the state to be copied is one of these states, we cannot guarantee that the chosen U will correctly clone it. This is in contrast to classical information, where machines like photocopiers can easily copy whatever classical information is sent to them. The controlled-not or xor operation of equation (28) is a copying operation for the states  and |0 |1 , but not for states such as |+  (|0 + |1 )/ 2 and  |-  (|0 - |1 )/ 2. The no-cloning theorem and the EPR paradox together reveal a rather subtle way in which non-relativistic quantum mechanics is a consistent theory. For, if cloning were possible, then EPR correlations could be used to communicate faster than light, which leads to a contradiction (an effect preceding a cause) once the principles of special relativity are taken into account. To see this, observe that by generating many clones, and then measuring them in different bases, Bob could deduce unambiguously whether his member of an EPR pair is in a state of the basis {|0 , |1 } or of the basis {|+ , |- }. Alice would communicate instanteously by forcing the EPR pair into one basis or the other through her choice of measurement axis (Glauber 1986).

 (we will usually drop normalisation factors such as 2 from now on, to keep the notation uncluttered). Alice and Bob need never have communicated: we imagine a mechanical central facility generating entangled pairs and sending one qubit to each of Alice and Bob, who store them (see fig. 9a). In this situation, Alice can communicate two classical bits by sending Bob only one qubit (namely her half of the entangled pair). This idea due to Bennett and Wootters (1992) is called "dense coding", since only one quantum bit travels from Alice to Bob in order to convey two classical bits. Two quantum bits are involved, but Alice only ever sees one of them. The method relies on the following fact: the four mutually orthogonal states |00 + |11 , |00 - |11 , |01 + |10 , |01 - |10 can be generated from each other by operations on a single qubit. This set of states is called the Bell basis, since they exhibit the strongest possible Bell-EPR correlations (Braunstein et. al. 1992). Starting from |00 + |11 , Alice can generate any of the Bell basis states by operating on her qubit with one of the operators {I, X, Y, Z}. Since there are four possibilities, her choice of operation represents two bits of classical information. She then sends her qubit to Bob, who must deduce which Bell basis state the qubits are in. This he does by operating on the pair with the xor gate, and measuring the target bit, thus distinguishing |00 ± |11 from |01 ± |10 . To find the sign in the superposition, he operates with H on the remaining qubit, and measures it. Hence Bob obtains two classical bits with no ambiguity.

Dense coding has no direct practical significance, rather, it is an example of the statement which began this section. It reveals a relationship between classiWe will discuss the following statement: cal information, qubits, and the information content of quantum entanglement (Barenco and Ekert 1995).

Dense coding

Suppose now that Alice and Bob are in possession of Suppose Alice wishes to communicate to Bob a single an entangled pair of qubits, in the state |00 + |11 qubit in the state | . If Alice already knows what state 24

she has, for example | = |0 , she can communicate it to Bob by sending just classical information, eg "Dear Bob, I have the state |0 . Regards, Alice." However, if | is unknown there is no way for Alice to learn it with certainty: any measurement she may perform may change the state, and she cannot clone it and measure the copies. Hence it appears that the only way to transmit | to Bob is to send him the physical qubit (ie the electron or atom or whatever), or possibly to swap the state into another quantum system and send that. In either case a quantum system is transmitted. Quantum teleportation (Bennett et. al. 1993, Bennett 1995) permits a way around this limitation. As in dense coding, we will use quantum entanglement as an information resource. Suppose Alice and Bob possess an entangled pair in the state |00 + |11 . Alice wishes to transmit to Bob a qubit in an unknown state | . Without loss of generality, we can write | = a |0 + b |1 where a and b are unknown coefficients. Then the initial state of all three qubits is

5.6

Quantum data compression

Having introduced the qubit, we now wish to show that it is a useful measure of quantum information content. The proof of this is due to Jozsa and Schumacher (1994) and Schumacher (1995), building on work of Kholevo (1973) and Levitin (1973). To begin the argument, we first need a quantity which expresses how much information you would gain if you were to learn the quantum state of some system Q. A suitable quantity is the Von Neumann entropy S() = -Tr log  (31)

where Tr is the trace operation, and  is the density operator describing an ensemble of states of the quantum system. This is to be compared with the classical Shannon entropy, equation (1). Suppose a classical random variable X has a probability distribution p(x). If a quantum system is prepared in a state |x dictated by the value of X, then the density matrix is x p(x) |x x|, where the states |x need not be a |000 + b |100 + a |011 + b |111 (29) orthogonal. It can be shown (Kholevo 1973, Levitin 1973) that S() is an upper limit on the classical muAlice now measures in the Bell basis the first two tual information I(X : Y ) between X and the result Y qubits, ie the unknown one and her member of the en- of a measurement on the system. tangled pair. The network to do this is shown in fig. 9b. After Alice has applied the xor and Hadamard gates, To make connection with qubits, we consider the reand just before she measures her qubits, the state is sources needed to store or transmit the state of a quan+ |10 (a |0 - b |1 ) + |11 (a |1 - b |0 ) .

The smaller system is transmitted down the channel, and at the receiving end the joint state is `decoded' into n systems q  of the same type as q (see fig. 9c). The final density matrix of each q  is  , and the whole process is deemed successful of  is sufficiently close to . The measure of the similarity between two density matrices is the fidelity defined by f (,  ) = Tr 1/2  1/2
2

Alice's measurements collapse the state onto one of four different possibilities, and yield two classical bits. The two bits are sent to Bob, who uses them to learn which of the operators {I, X, Z, Y } he must apply to his qubit in order to place it in the state a |0 + b |1 = | . Thus Bob ends up with the qubit (ie the quantum information, not the actual quantum system) which Alice wished to transmit. Note that the quantum information can only arrive at Bob if it disappears from Alice (no cloning). Also, quantum information is complete information: | is the complete description of Alice's qubit. The use of the word `teleportation' draws attention to these two facts. Teleportation becomes an especially important idea when we come to consider communication in the presence of noise, section 9.

(32)

This can be interpreted as the probability that q  passes a test which ascertained if it was in the state . When  and  are both pure states, | | and |  |, the fidelity is none other than the familiar overlap: f = | |  |2 . Our aim is to find the smallest transmitted system which permits f = 1 -  for   1. The argument is

25

analogous to the `typical sequences' idea used in section 2.2. Restricting ourselves for simplicity to two-state systems, the total state of n systems is represented by a vector in a Hilbert space of 2n dimensions. However, if the von Neumann entropy S() < 1 then it is highly likely (ie tends to certainty in the limit of large n) that, in any given realisation, the state vector actually falls in a typical sub-space of Hilbert space. Schumacher and Jozsa showed that the dimension of the typical sub-space is 2nS() . Hence only nS() qubits are required to represent the quantum information faithfully, and the qubit (ie the logarithm of the dimensionality of Hilbert space) is a useful measure of quantum information. Furthermore, the encoding and decoding operation is `blind': it does not depend on knowledge of the exact states being transmitted. Schumacher and Josza's result is powerful because it is general: no assumptions are made about the exact nature of the quantum states involved. In particular, they need not be orthogonal. If the states to be transmitted were mutually orthogonal, the whole problem would reduce to one of classical information. The `encoding' and `decoding' required to achieve such quantum data compression and decompression is technologically very demanding. It cannot at present be done at all using photons. However, it is the ultimate compression allowed by the laws of physics. The details of the required quantum networks have been deduced by Cleve and DiVincenzo (1996). As well as the essential concept of information, other classical ideas such as Huffman coding have their quantum counterparts. Furthermore, Schumacher and Nielson (1996) derive a quantity which they call `coherent information' which measures that part of the mutual information between entangled systems which cannot be accounted for classically. This is a helpful way to understand the Bell-EPR correlations.

phy. The essential ideas are as follows: Alice and Bob are, as usual, widely seperated and wish to communicate. Alice sends to Bob 2n qubits, each prepared in one of the states |0 , |1 , |+ , |- , randomly chosen5 . Bob measures his received bits, choosing the measurement basis randomly between {|0 , |1 } and {|+ , |- }. Next, Alice and Bob inform each other publicly (ie anyone can listen in) of the basis they used to prepare or measure each qubit. They find out on which occasions they by chance used the same basis, which happens on average half the time, and retain just those results. In the absence of errors or interference, they now share the same random string of n classical bits (they agree for example to associate |0 and |+ with 0; |1 and |- with 1). This classical bit string is often called the raw quantum transmission, RQT. So far nothing has been gained by using qubits. The important feature is, however, that it is impossible for anyone to learn Bob's measurement results by observing the qubits en route, without leaving evidence of their presence. The crudest way for an eavesdopper Eve to attempt to discover the key would be for her to intercept the qubits and measure them, then pass them on to Bob. On average half the time Eve guesses Alice's basis correctly and thus does not disturb the qubit. However, Eve's correct guesses do not coincide with Bob's, so Eve learns the state of half of the n qubits which Alice and Bob later decide to trust, and disturbs the other half, for example sending to Bob |+ for Alice's |0 . Half of those disturbed will be projected by Bob's measurement back onto the original state sent by Alice, so overall Eve corrupts n/4 bits of the RQT. Alice and Bob can now detect Eve's presence simply by randomly choosing n/2 bits of the RQT and announcing publicly the values they have. If they agree on all these bits, then they can trust that no eavesdropper was present, since the probability that Eve was present and they happened to choose n/2 uncorrupted bits is (3/4)n/2  10-125 for n = 1000. The n/2 undisclosed bits form the secret key.

In practice the protocol is more complicated since noise will currupt some of the qubits even in the absence of No overview of quantum information is complete with- an evesdropper. Instead of rejecting the key if many of out a mention of quantum key distribution, commonly the disclosed bits differ, Alice and Bob retain it as long called quantum cryptography.

Quantum cryptography

as they find the error rate to be well below 25%. They then process the key in two steps. The first is to detect and remove errors, which is done by publicly comparing parity checks on publicly chosen random subsets of the bits, while discarding bits to prevent increasing Eve's information. The second step is to decrease Eve's knowledge of the key, by distilling from it a smaller key, composed of parity values calculated from the original key. In this way a key of around n/4 bits is obtained, of which Eve probably knows less than 10-6 of one bit (Bennett et. al. 1992). The protocol just described is not the only one possible. Another approach (Ekert 1991) involves the use of EPR pairs, which Alice and Bob measure along one of three different axes. To rule out eavesdropping they check for Bell-EPR correlations in their results. The great thing about quantum key distribution is that it is feasible with current technology. A pioneering experiment (Bennett and Brassard 1989) demonstrated the principle, and much progress has been made since then. Hughes et. al. (1995) and Pheonix and Townsend (1995) summarised the state of affairs two years ago, and recently Zbinden et. al. (1997) have reported excellent key distribution through 23 km of standard telecom fibre under lake Geneva. The qubits are stored in the polarisation states of laser pulses, ie coherent states of light, with on average 0.1 photons per pulse. This low light level is necessary so that pulses containing more than one photon are unlikely. Such pulses would provide duplicate qubits, and hence a means for an evesdropper to go undetected. The system achieves a bit error rate of 1.35%, which is low enough to guarantee privacy in the full protocol. The data transmission rate is rather low: MHz as opposed to the GHz rates common in classical communications, but the system is very reliable.

The universal quantum computer

We now have sufficient concepts to understand the jewel at the heart of quantum information theory, namely, the quantum computer (QC). Ekert and Jozsa (1996) and Barenco (1996) give introductory reviews concentrating on the quantum computer and factorisation; a review with emphasis on practicalities is provided by Spiller (1996). Introductory material is also provided by DiVincenzo (1995) and Shor (1996). The QC is first and foremost a machine which is a theoretical construct, like a thought-experiment, whose purpose is to allow quantum information processing to be formally analysed. In particular it establishes the Church-Turing Principle introduced in section 4. Here is a prescription for a quantum computer, based on that of Deutsch (1985, 1989): A quantum computer is a set of n qubits in which the following operations are experimentally feasible: 1. Each qubit can be prepared in some known state |0 . 2. Each qubit can be measured in the basis {|0 , |1 }. 3. A universal quantum gate (or set of gates) can be applied at will to any finite subset of the qubits. 4. The qubits do not evolve other than via the above transformations.

This prescription is incomplete in certain technical ways to be discussed, but it encompasses the main Such spectacular experimental mastery is in contrast ideas. The model of computation we have in mind is a network model, in which logic gates are applied seto the subject of the next section. quentially to a set of bits (here, quantum bits). In an electronic classical computer, logic gates are spread out in space on a circuit board, but in the QC we typically imagine the logic gates to be interactions turned on and off in time, with the qubits at fixed positions, as in a quantum network diagram (fig. 8, 12). Other models of quantum computation can be conceived, such as a cellular automaton model (Margolus 1991).

Church-Turing principle

The universal quantum gate is the quantum equivalent of the classical universal gate, namely a gate which by its repeated use on different combinations of bits can generate the action of any other gate. What is the set of all possible quantum gates, however? To answer this, we appeal to the principles of quantum mechanics (Schr¨dinger's equation), and answer that since all o quantum evolution is unitary, it is sufficient (though perhaps not necessary) to be able to generate all unitary transformations of the n qubits in the computer. This might seem a tall order, since we have a continuous and therefore infinite set. However, it turns out that quite simple quantum gates can be universal, as Deutsch showed in 1985. The simplest way to think about universal gates is to consider the pair of gates V (, ) and controlled-not (or xor), where V (, ) is a general rotation of a single qubit, ie V (, ) = cos(/2) -ie-i sin(/2) i -ie sin(/2) cos(/2) . (33)

Having presented the QC, it is necessary to argue for its universality, ie that it fulfills the Church-Turing Principle as claimed. The two-step argument is very simple. First, the state of any finite quantum system is simply a vector in Hilbert space, and therefore can be represented to arbitrary precision by a finite number of qubits. Secondly, the evolution of any finite quantum system is a unitary transformation of the state, and therefore can be simulated on the QC, which can generate any unitary transformation with arbitrary precision. A point of principle is raised by Myers (1997), who points out that there is a difficulty with computational tasks for which the number of steps for completion cannot be predicted. We cannot in general observe the QC to find out if it has halted, in contrast to a classical computer. However, we will only be concerned with tasks where either the number of steps is predictable, or the QC can signal completion by setting a dedicated qubit which is otherwise not involved in the computation (Deutsch 1985). This is a very broad class of problems. Nielsen and Chuang (1997) consider the use of a fixed quantum gate array, showing that there is no array which, operating on qubits representing both data and program, can perform any unitary transformation on the data. However, we consider a machine in which a classical computer controls the quantum gates applied to a quantum register, so any gate array can be `ordered' by a classical program to the classical computer.

It can be shown that any n × n unitary matrix can be formed by composing 2-qubit xor gates and singlequbit rotations. Therefore, this pair of operations is universal for quantum computation. A purist may argue that V (, ) is an infinite set of gates since the parameters  and  are continuous, but it suffices to choose two particular irrational angles for  and , and the resulting single gate can generate all singlequbit rotations by repeated application. However, a practical system need not use such laborious methods. The xor and rotation operations can be combined to make a controlled rotation which is a single universal gate. Such universal quantum gates were discussed by Deutsch et. al. (1995), DiVincenzo (1995) and Barenco (1995).

The QC is certainly an interesting theoretical tool. However, there hangs over it a large and important question-mark: what about imperfection? The prescription given above is written as if measurements and gates can be applied with arbitrary precision, which is unphysical, as is the fourth requirement (no extraneous evolution). The prescription can be made realistic by It is remarkable that 2-qubit gates are sufficient for attaching to each of the four requirements a statement quantum computation. This is why the quantum gate about the degree of allowable imprecision. This is a is a powerful and important concept. subject of on-going research, and we will take it up in section 9. Meanwhile, let us investigate more specifically what a sufficiently well-made quantum computer might do.

It is well known that classical computers are able to calculate the behaviour of quantum systems, so we have not yet demonstrated that a quantum computer can do anything which a classical computer can not. Indeed, since our theories of physics always involve equations which we can write down and manipulate, it seems highly unlikely that quantum mechanics, or any future physical theory, would permit computational problems to be addressed which are not in principle solvable on a large enough classical Turing machine. However, as we saw in section 3.2, those words `large enough', and also `fast enough', are centrally important in computer science. Problems which are computationally `hard' can be impossible in practice. In technical language, while quantum computing does not enlarge the set of computational problems which can be addressed (compared to classical computing), it does introduce the possibility of new complexity classes. Put more simply, tasks for which classical computers are too slow may be solvable with quantum computers.

7.2

Period finding and Shor's factorisation algorithm

So far we have discussed simulation of Nature, which is a rather restricted type of computation. We would like to let the QC loose on more general problems, but it has so far proved hard to find ones on which it performs better than classical computers. However, the fact that there exist such problems at all is a profound insight into physics, and has stimulated much of the recent interest in the field. Currently one of the most important quantum algorithms is that for finding the period of a function. Suppose a function f (x) is periodic with period r, ie f (x) = f (x + r). Suppose further that f (x) can be efficiently computed from x, and all we know initially is that N/2 < r < N for some N . Assuming there is no analytic technique to deduce the period of f (x), the best we can do on a classical computer is to calculate f (x) for of order N/2 values of x, and find out when the function repeats itself. This is inefficient since the number of operations is exponential in the input size log N (the information required to specify N ). The task can be solved efficiently on a QC by the elegant method shown in fig. 10, due to Shor (1994, 1996). The QC requires 2n qubits, where n = 2 log N  (the notation x means the nearest integer greater than x). These are divided into two `registers', each of n qubits. They will be referred to as the x and y registers; both are initially prepared in the state |0 (ie all n qubits in states |0 ). Next, the operation H is applied to each qubit in the x register, making the total state 1  w
w-1 x=0

7.1

Simulation of physical systems

The first and most obvious application of a QC is that of simulating some other quantum system. To simulate a state vector in a 2n -dimensional Hilbert space, a classical computer needs to manipulate vectors containing of order 2n complex numbers, whereas a quantum computer requires just n qubits, making it much more efficient in storage space. To simulate evolution, in general both the classical and quantum computers will be inefficient. A classical computer must manipulate matrices containing of order 22n elements, which requires a number of operations (multiplication, addition) exponentially large in n, while a quantum computer must build unitary operations in 2n -dimensional Hilbert space, which usually requires an exponentially large number of elementary quantum logic gates. Therefore the quantum computer is not guaranteed to simulate every physical system efficiently. However, it can be shown that it can simulate a large class of quantum systems efficiently, including many for which there is no efficient classical algorithm, such as many-body systems with local interactions (Lloyd 1996, Zalka 1996, Wiesner 1996, Meyer 1996, Lidar and Biam 1996, Abrams

|x |0

(34)

where w = 2n . This operation is referred to as a Fourier transform in fig. 10, for reasons that will shortly become apparant. The notation |x means a state such as |0011010 , where 0011010 is the integer x in binary notation. In this context the basis {|0 , |1 } is referred to as the `computational basis.' It is convenient (though not of course necessary) to use this basis when describing the computer.

29

Next, a network of logic gates is applied to both x and y regisiters, to perform the transformation Uf |x |0 = |x |f (x) . Note that this transformation can be unitary because the input state |x |0 is in one to one correspondance with the output state |x |f (x) , so the process is reversible. Now, applying Uf to the state given in eq. (34), we obtain

Note that eq. (34) is an example of this, operating on the initial state |0 . The quantum network to apply UF T is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm (see, e.g., Knuth (1981)). The quantum version was worked out by Coppersmith (1994) and Deutsch (1994) independently, a clear presentation may also be found in Ekert and Josza (1996), Barenco (1996). Before applying UF T to eq. 36 we will make the simplifying w-1 1 assumption that r divides w exactly, so M = w/r - 1.  |x |f (x) (35) The essential ideas are not affected by this restriction; w x=0 when it is relaxed some added complications must be This state is illustrated in fig. 11a. At this point some- taken into account (Shor 1994, 1996; Ekert and Josza thing rather wonderful has taken place: the value of 1996). f (x) has been calculated for w = 2n values of x, all in one go! This feature is referred to as quantum paral- The y register no longer concerns us, so we will just lelism and represents a huge parallelism because of the consider the x state from eq.

Although the 2 evaluations of f (x) are in some sense `present' in the quantum state in eq. (35), unfortunately we cannot gain direct access to them. For, a measurement (in the computational basis) of the y register, which is the next step in the algorithm, will only reveal one value of f (x)6 . Suppose the value obtained is f (x) = u. The y register state collapses onto |u , and the total state becomes 1  M +1

where du + jr, for j = 0, 1, 2 . . . M , are all the values of x for which f (x) = u. In other words the periodicity of f (x) means that the x register remains in a superposition of M + 1  w/r states, at values of x separated by the period r. Note that the offset du of the set of x values depends on the value u obtained in the measurement of the y register. The quantum period-finding algorithm we have described is efficient as long as Uf , the evaluation of f (x), It now remains to extract the periodicity of the state is efficient.

This state is illustrated in fig. 11b. The final state of the x register is now measured, and we see that the value obtained must be a multiple of w/r. It remains to deduce r from this. We have x = w/r where  is unknown. If  and r have no common factors, then we cancel x/w down to an irreducible fraction and thus obtain  and r. If  and r have a common factor, which is unlikely for large r, then the algorithm fails. In this case, the whole algorithm must be repeated from the start. After a number of repetitions of order log r, the probability of success can be shown to be arbitrarily close to 1 (Ekert and Josza 1996).

(37) To add the icing on the cake, it can be remarked that the important factorisation problem mentioned in seck=0 tion 3.2 can be reduced to one of finding the period of 6 It is not strictly necessary to measure the y register, but this a simple function. This and all the above ingredients simplifies the description. ei2kx/w |k 30

were first brought together by Shor (1994), who thus showed that the factorisation problem is tractable on an ideal quantum computer. The function to be evaluated in this case is f (x) = ax mod N where N is the number to be factorised, and a < N is chosen randomly. One can show using elementary number theory (Ekert and Josza 1996) that for most choices of a, the period r is even and ar/2 ± 1 shares a common factor with N . The common factor (which is of course a factor N ) can then be deduced rapidly using a classical algorithm due to Euclid (circa 300 BC; see, e.g. Hardy and Wright 1965). To evaluate f (x) efficiently, repeated squaring (modulo N ) is used, giving powers ((a2 )2 )2 . . .. Selected such powers of a, corresponding to the binary expansion of a, are then multiplied together. Complete networks for the whole of Shor's algorithm were described by Miquel et. al. (1996), Vedral et. al. (1996) and Beckman et. al. (1996). They require of order 300(log N )3 logic gates. Therefore, to factorise numbers of order 10130 , ie at the limit of current classical methods, would require  2 × 1010 gates per run, or 7 hours if the `switching rate' is one megaHertz. The algorithm must be run about log r  60 times to ensure at least one successful run, so the total time is two weeks on a 1 MHz ideal (ie noise-free) quantum computer. Considering how difficult it is to make a quantum computer, this offers no advantage over classical computation. However, if we double the number of digits to 260 then the problem is intractable classically (see section 3.2), while the ideal quantum computer takes just 16 times longer than before. The existence of such a powerful method is an exciting and profound new insight into quantum theory. The period-finding algorithm appears at first sight like a conjuring trick: it is not quite clear how the quantum computer managed to produce the period like a rabbit out of a hat. Examining fig. 11 and equations (34) to (38), I would say that the most important features are contained in eq. (35). They are not only the quantum parallelism already mentioned, but also quantum entanglement, and, finally, quantum interference. Each value of f (x) retains a link with the value of x which produced it, through the entanglement of the x and y registers in eq. (35). The `magic' happens when a measurement of the y register produces the special state | (eq. 36) in the x register, and it is quan-

tum entanglement which permits this (see also Jozsa 1997a). The final Fourier transform can be regarded as an interference between the various superposed states in the x register (compare with the action of a diffraction grating). Interference effects can be used for computational purposes with classical light fields, or water waves for that matter, so interference is not in itself the essentially quantum feature. Rather, the exponentially large number of interfering states, and the entanglement, are features which do not arise in classical systems.

7.3

Grover's search algorithm

Despite considerable efforts in the quantum computing community, the number of useful quantum algorithms which have been discovered remains small. They consist mainly of variants on the period-finding algorithm presented above, and another quite different task: that of searching a random database. Grover (1997) presented a quantum algorithm for the following problem: given an unstructured list of items {xi }, find a particular item xj = t. Think, for example, of looking for a particular telephone number in the telephone directory (for someone whose name you do not know). It is not hard to prove that classical algorithms can do no better than searching through the list, requiring on average N/2 steps, for a  of N items. Grover's list algorithm requires of order N steps. The task remains computationally hard: it is not transferred to a new complexity class, but it is remarkable that such a seemingly hopeless task can be speeded up at all. The  `quantum speed-up' N /2 is much greater than that achieved by Shor's factorisation algorithm, and would be important for the huge sets (N  1016 ) which can arise, for example, in code-breaking problems (Brassard 1997). An important further point was proved by Bennett et. al. (1997), namely that Grover's algorithm is  optimal: no quantum algorithm can do better than O( N ). A brief sketch of Grover's algorithm is as follows. Each item has a label i, and we must be able to test in a unitary way whether any item is the one we are seeking. In other words there must exist a unitary operator S such that S |i = |i if i = j, and S |j = - |j , where

31

j is the label of the special item. For example, the test might establish whether i is the solution of some hard computational problem7 . The method begins by placing a single quantum register in a superposition of all computational states, as in the period-finding algorithm (eq. (34)). Define |a, b = a |j + b |i

programmer's toolbox is thus slowly growing. It seems safe to predict, however, that the class of problems for which quantum computers out-perform classical ones is a special and therefore small class. On the other hand, any problem for which finding solutions is hard, but testing a candidate solution is easy, can at last resort be solved by an exhaustive search, and here Grover's (40) algorithm may prove very useful.

i=j

where j is the label of the element t = xj to be found, and a2 + (N - 1)b2 = 1 so that the state is normalised. The initial state can be written |a, b with  a = b = 1/ N . Now apply S, which reverses the sign of the one special element of the superposition, then Fourier transform, change the sign of all components except |0 , and Fourier transform back again. These operations represent a subtle interference effect which achieves the following transformation: UG |a, b = N -2 N -2 2 2N - 2 b+ a, b- a N N N N (41)

The coefficient of the special element is now slightly larger than that of all the other elements. The method proceeds simply by applying UG m times, where m   (/4) N . This causes a slowly to increase and b to decrease, so the quantum state becomes closer and closer to |j . After m iterations the state is measured and the value j obtained. However, if UG is applied too many times, a decreases again, so it is important to know m, which was deduced by Boyer et. al. (1996). Kristen Fuchs compares the technique to cooking a souffl´. The e state is placed in the `quantum oven' and the desired answer rises slowly. You must open the oven at the right time, neither too soon not too late, to guarantee success. Otherwise the souffl´ will fall--the state e collapses to the wrong answer. The two algorithms I have presented are the easiest to describe, and illustrate many of the methods of quantum computation. However, just what further methods may exist is an open question. Kitaev (1996) has shown how to solve the factorisation and related problems using a technique fundamentally different from Shor's. His ideas have some similarities to Grover's. Kitaev's method is helpfully clarified by Jozsa (1997b) who also brings out the common features of several quantum algorithms based on Fourier transforms. The quantum

Experimental quantum information processors

some of the important methods but were not experimentally feasible.

The most elementary quantum logical operations have been demonstrated in many physics experiments during the past 50 years. For example, the not operation (X) is no more than a stimulated transition between two energy levels |0 and |1 . The important xor operation can also be identified as a driven transition in a four-level system. However, if we wish to contemplate a quantum computer it is necessary to find a system which is sufficiently controllable to allow quantum logic gates to be applied at will, and yet is sufficiently complicated to store many qubits of quantum information. It is very hard to find such systems. One might hope to fabricate quantum devices on solid state microchips-- this is the logical progression of the microfabrication techniques which have allowed classical computers to become so powerful. However, quantum computation relies on complicated interference effects and the great problem in realising it is the problem of noise. No quantum system is really isolated, and the coupling to the environment produces decoherence which destroys the quantum computation. In solid state devices the environment is the substrate, and the coupling to this environment is strong, producing typical decoherence times of the order of picoseconds. It is important to realise that it is not enough to have two different states |0 and |1 which are themselves stable (for example states of different current in a superconductor): we require also that superpositions such as |0 + |1 preserve their phase, and this is typically where the decoherence timescale is so short. At present there are two candidate systems which should permit quantum computation on 10 to 40 qubits. These are the proposal of Cirac and Zoller (1995) using a line of singly charged atoms confined and cooled in vacuum in an ion trap, and the proposal of Gershenfeld and Chuang (1997), and simultaneously Cory et. al. (1996), using the methods of bulk nuclear magnetic resonance. In both cases the proposals rely on the impressive efforts of a large community of researchers which developed the experimental techniques. Previous proposals for experimental quantum computation (Lloyd 1993, Berman et. al. 1994, Barenco et. al. 1995, DiVincenzo 1995) touched on

8.1

Ion trap

The ion trap method is illustrated in fig. 12, and described in detail by Steane (1997). A string of ions is confined by a combination of oscillating and static electric fields in a linear `Paul trap' in high vacuum (10-8 Pa). A single laser beam is split by beam splitters and acousto-optic modulators into many beam pairs, one pair illuminating each ion. Each ion has two long-lived states, for example different levels of the ground state hyperfine structure (the lifetime of such states against spontaneous decay can exceed thousands of years). Let us refer to these two states as |g and |e ; they are orthogonal and so together represent one qubit. Each laser beam pair can drive coherent Raman transitions between the internal states of the relevant ion. This allows any single-qubit quantum gate to be applied to any ion, but not two-qubit gates. The latter requires an interaction between ions, and this is provided by their Coulomb repulsion. However, exactly how to use this interaction is far from obvious; it required the important insight of Cirac and Zoller. Light carries not only energy but also momentum, so whenever a laser beam pair interacts with an ion, it exchanges momentum with the ion. In fact, the mutual repulsion of the ions means that the whole string of ions moves en masse when the motion is quantised (M¨ssbauer effect). The motion of the ion string is o quantised because the ion string is confined in the potential provided by the Paul trap. The quantum states of motion correspond to the different degrees of excitation (`phonons') of the normal modes of vibration of the string. In particular we focus on the ground state of the motion |n = 0 and the lowest excited state |n = 1 of the fundamental mode. To achieve, for example, controlled-Z between ion x and ion y, we start with the motion in the ground state |n = 0 . A pulse of the laser beams on ion x drives the transition |n = 0 |g x  |n = 0 |g x , |n = 0 |e x  |n = 1 |g x , so the ion finishes in the ground state, and the motion finishes in the initial state of the ion: this is a `swap' operation. Next a pulse of the laser beams on ion y

and coherence to permit factorisation of hundred-digit numbers. However, it would be fascinating to try a quantum algorithm on just a few qubits (4 to 10) and thus to observe the principles of quantum information processing at work. We will discuss in section 9 methods which should allow the number of coherent gate operations to be greatly increased.

Finally, we repeat the initial pulse on ion x. The overall effect of the three pulses is |n = 0 |g

which is exactly a controlled-Z between x and y. Each laser pulse must have a precisely controlled frequency and duration. The controlled-Z gate and the singlequbit gates together provide a universal set, so we can perform arbitrary transformations of the joint state of all the ions! To complete the prescription for a quantum computer (section 6), we must pe able to prepare the initial state and measure the final state. The first is possible through the methods of optical pumping and laser cooling, the second through the `quantum jump' or `electron shelving' measurement technique. All these are powerful techniques developed in the atomic physics community over the past twenty years. However, the combination of all the techniques at once has only been achieved in a single experiment, which demonstrated preparation, quantum gates, and measurement for just a single trapped ion (Monroe et. al 1995). The chief experimental difficulty in the ion trap method is to cool the string of ions to the ground state of the trap (a sub-microKelvin temperature), and the chief source of decoherence is the heating of this motion owing to the coupling between the charged ion string and noise voltages in the electrodes (Steane 1997, Wineland et. al. 1997). It is unknown just how much the heating can be reduced. A conservative statement is that in the next few years 100 quantum gates could be applied to a few ions without losing coherence. In the longer term one may hope for an order of magnitude increase in both figures. It seems clear that an ion trap processor will never achieve sufficient storage capacity

The proposal using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is illustrated in fig. 13. The quantum processor in this case is a molecule containing a `backbone' of about ten atoms, with other atoms such as hydrogen attached so as to use up all the chemical bonds. It is the nuclei which interest us. Each has a magnetic moment associated with the nuclear spin, and the spin states provide the qubits. The molecule is placed in a large magnetic field, and the spin states of the nuclei are manipulated by applying oscillating magnetic fields in pulses of controlled duration. So far, so good. The problem is that the spin state of the nuclei of a single molecule can be neither prepared nor measured. To circumvent this problem, we use not a single molecule, but a cup of liquid containing some 1020 molecules! We then measure the average spin state, which can be achieved since the average oscillating magnetic moment of all the nuclei is large enough to produce a detectable magnetic field. Some subtleties enter at this point. Each of the molecules in the liquid has a very slightly different local magnetic field, influenced by other molecules in the vicinity, so each `quantum processor' evolves slightly differently. This problem is circumvented by the spin-echo technique, a standard tool in NMR which allows the effects of free evolution of the spins to be reversed, without reversing the effect of the quantum gates. However, this increases the difficulty of applying long sequences of quantum gates. The remaining problem is to prepare the initial state. The cup of liquid is in thermal equilibrium to begin with, so the different spin states have occupation probabilities given by the Boltzman distribution. One makes use of the fact that spin states are close in energy, and so have nearly equal occupations initially. Thus the density matrix  of the O(1020 ) nuclear spins

34

is very close to the identity matrix I. It is the small difference  =  - I which can be used to store quantum information. Although  is not the density matrix of any quantum system, it nevertheless transforms under well-chosen field pulses in the same way as a density matrix would, and hence can be considered to represent an effective quantum computer. The reader is referred to Gershenfeld and Chuang (1997) for a detailed description, including the further subtlety that an effective pure state must be distilled out of  by means of a pulse sequence which performs quantum data compression.

Quantum error correction

In section 7 we discussed some beautiful quantum algorithms. Their power only rivals classical computers, however, on quite large problems, requiring thousands of qubits and billions of quantum gates (with the possible exception of algorithms for simulation of physical systems). In section 8 we examined some experimental systems, and found that we can only contemplate `computers' of a few tens of qubits and perhaps some thousands of gates. Such systems are not `computers' at all because they are not sufficiently versatile: they NMR experiments have for some years routinely should at best be called modest quantum information achieved spin state manipulations and measurements processors.

One way to understand this is to examine in detail a device such as a flip-flop, or even a humble 1995). mechanical switch. Their stability is based on a combination of amplification and dissipation: a small de35

parture of a mechanical switch from `on' or `off' results in a large restoring force from the spring. Amplifiers do the corresponding job in a flip-flop. The restoring force is not sufficient alone, however: with a conservative force, the switch would oscillate between `on' and `off'. It is important also to have damping, supplied by an inelastic collision which generates heat in the case of a mechanical switch, and by resistors in the electronic flip-flop. However, these methods are ruled out for a quantum computer by the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The no-cloning theorem means amplification of unknown quantum states is impossible, and dissipation is incompatible with unitary evolution. Such fundamental considerations lead to the widely accepted belief that quantum mechanics rules out the possibility to stabilize a quantum computer against the effects of random noise. However, by careful application of information theory one can find away around this impasse. The idea is to adapt the error correction methods of classical information theory to the quantum situation. Quantum error correction (QEC) was established as an important and general method by Steane (1996) and independently Calderbank and Shor (1996). Some of the ideas had been introduced previously by Shor (1995) and Steane (1996). They are related to the `entanglement purification' introduced by Bennett et. al. (1995) and independently Deutsch et. al. (1996). The theory of QEC was further advanced by Knill and Laflamme (1997), Ekert and Macchiavello (1996), Bennett et. al. (1996). The latter paper describes the optimal 5-qubit code also independently discovered by Laflamme et. al. (1996). Gottesman (1996) and Calderbank et. al. (1997) discovered a general grouptheoretic framework, introducing the important concept of the stabilizer, which also enabled many more codes to be found (Calderbank et. al. 1996, Steane 1996ab).

ant' networks remove more noise than they introduce. Shor's methods were generalised by DiVincenzo and Shor (1996) and made more efficient by Steane (1997). Knill and Laflamme (1996) introduced the idea of `concatenated' coding, which is a recursive coding method. It has the advantage of allowing arbitrarily long quantum computations as long as the noise per elementary operation is below a finite threshold, at the cost of inefficient use of quantum memory (so requiring a large computer). This threshold result was derived by several authors (Knill et al 1996, Aharonov and Ben-Or 1996, Gottesman et. al. 1997). The discovery of QEC was preceeded by a related idea which also permits noise-free transmission of quantum states over a noisy quantum channel. This is the `entanglement purification' (Bennett et. al. 1995, Deutsch et. al. 1996). The central idea here is for Alice to generate many entangled pairs of qubits, sending one of each pair down the noisy channel to Bob. Bob and Alice store their qubits, and perform simple parity checking measurements: for example, Bob's performs xor between a given qubit and the next he receives, then measures just the target qubit. Alice does the same on her qubits, and they compare results. If they agree, the unmeasured qubits are (by chance) closer than average to the desired state |00 + |11 . If they disagree, the qubits are rejected. By recursive use of such checks, a few `good' entangled pairs are distilled out of the many noisy ones. Once in possession of a good entangled state, Alice and Bob can communicate by teleportation. A thorough discussion is given by Bennett et. al. (1996). Using similar ideas, with important improvements, van Enk et. al. (1997) have recently shown how quantum information might be reliably transmitted between atoms in separated high-Q optical cavities via imperfect optical fibres, using imperfect gate operations. I will now outline the main principles of QEC.

Note that these environment states are not necessarily normalised. Eq. (43) tells us that The only assumption in the above was that the noise in we have essentially three types of error to correct on eq. (44) only contains error operators in the correctable each qubit: X, Y and Z errors. These are `bit flip' (X) set S. In practice, the noise includes both members and errors, phase errors (Z) or both (Y = XZ). non-members of S, and the important quantity is the probability that the state collapses onto a correctable Suppose our computer q is to manipulate k qubits of one when the syndrome is extracted. It is here that the quantum information. Let a general state of the k theory of error-correcting codes enters in: our task is to qubits be | . We first make the computer larger, infind encoding and extraction operations E, A such that troducing a further n - k qubits, initially in the state the set S of correctable errors includes all the errors |0 . Call the enlarged system qc. An `encoding' opermost likely to occur. This is a very difficult problem. ation is performed: E(| |0 ) = |E . Now, let noise affect the n qubits of qc. Without loss of generality, It is a general truth that to permit efficient stabilizathe noise can be written as a sum of `error operators' tion against noise, we have to know something about M , where each error operator is a tensor product of the noise we wish to suppress. The most obvious quasin operators (one for each qubit), taken from the set realistic assumption is that of uncorrelated stochastic {I, X, Y, Z}. For example M = I1 X2 I3 Y4 Z5 X6 I7 for noise. That is, at a given time or place the noise might the case n = 7. A general noisy state is have any effect, but the effects on different qubits, or |es Ms |E (44) on the same qubit at different times, are uncorrelated. This is the quantum equivalent of the binary symets ric channel, section 2.3. By assuming uncorrelated Now we introduce even more qubits: a further n - k, stochastic noise we can place all possible error operprepared in the state |0 a . This additional set is ators M in a heirarchy of probability: those affecting called an `ancilla'. For any given encoding E, there few qubits (i.e. only a few terms in the tensor product exists a syndrome extraction operation A, operating are different from I) are most likely, while those afon the joint system of qc and a. whose effect is fecting many qubits at once are unlikely. Our aim will A(Ms |E |0 a ) = (Ms |E ) |s a  Ms  S. The set S be to find quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) is the set of correctable errors, which depends on the such that all errors affecting up to t qubits will be corencoding.

Such a QECC is termed a `t-error correcting ber which indicates which error operator Ms we are code'. dealing with, so the states |s a are mutually orthogonal. Suppose for simplicity that the general noisy state The simplest code construction (that discovered by (44) only contains Ms  S, then the joint state of en- Calderbank and Shor and Steane) goes as follows. First vironment, qc and a after syndrome extraction is we notice that a classical error correcting code, such as

We now measure the ancilla state, and something rather wonderful happens: the whole state collapses onto |es (Ms |E ) |s a , for some particular value of s. Now, instead of general noise, we have just one particular error operator Ms to worry about. Furthermore,

the Hamming code shown in table 1, can be used to correct X errors. The proof relies on eq. (17) which permits the syndrome extraction A to produce an ancilla state |s which depends only on the error Ms and not on the computer's state | . This suggests that we store k quantum bits by means of the 2k mutually orthogonal n-qubit states |i , where the binary num-

ber i is a member of a classical error correcting code C, see section 2.4. This will not allow correction of Z errors, however. Observe that since Z = HXH, the correction of Z errors is equivalent to rotating the state of each qubit by H, correcting X errors, and rotating back again. This rotation is called a Hadamard transform; it is just a change in basis. The next ingredient is to notice the following special property (Steane 1996): ~ H

is n - k, so if every single-qubit error, and the errorfree case, is to have a different syndrome, we require 2n-k  3n + 1. For k = 1 this lower limit is filled exactly by n = 5 and indeed such a 5-qubit single-error correcting code exists (Laflamme et. al. 1996, Bennett et. al. 1996). More generally, the remarkable fact is that for fixed k/n, codes exist for which t/n is bounded from below as n   (Calderbank and Shor 1995, Steane 1996, Calderbank et. al. 1997). This leads to a quantum version of Shannon's theorem (section 2.4), though an exact definition of the capacity of a quantum channel remains unclear (Schumacher and Nielsen 1996, Lloyd 1997, Bennett et. al. 1996, Knill and Laflamme 1996). For finite n, the probability that the noise produces uncorrectable errors scales roughly as (n)t+1 , where   1 is the probability of an arbitrary error on each qubit. This represents an extremely powerful noise suppression. We need to be able to reduce  to a sufficiently small value by passive means, and then QEC does the rest. For example, consider the case   0.001. With n = 23 there exisits a code correcting all t = 3-qubit errors (Golay 1949, Steane 1997). The probability that uncorrectable noise occurs is  0.0234  3 × 10-7, thus the noise is suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude.

In words, this says that if we make a quantum state by superposing all the members of a classical error correcting code C, then the Hadamard-transformed state is just a superposition of all the members of the dual code C  . From this it follows, after some further steps, that it is possible to correct both X and Z errors (and therefore also Y errors) if we use quantum states of the form given in eq. (46), as long as both C and C  are good classical error correcting codes, i.e. both have good correction abilities.

The simplest QECC constructed by the above recipe requires n = 7 qubits to store a single (k = 1) qubit of useful quantum information. The two orthogonal states required to store the information are built from the Hamming code shown in table 1: So far I have described QEC as if the ancilla and the many quantum gates and measurements involved were |0E  |0000000 + |1010101 + |0110011 + |1100110 themselves noise-free.

This is daunting but possible. keep track of quantum information, and to be confident that it is independent of the details of the system The error correction methods briefly described here are in which it is stored. This is necessary to underpin not the only type possible. If we know more about other concepts such as error correction and computthe noise, then humbler methods requiring just a few ing.

Kitaev. These show that quantum mechanics allows information processing of a kind ruled out in classical physics. It relies on the propagation of a quantum state through a huge (exponentially large) number of dimensions of Hilbert space. The computation result arises from a controlled interference among many computational paths, which even after we have examined the mathematical description, still seems wonderful and surprising. The intrinsic difficulty of quantum computation lies in the sensitivity of large-scale interference to noise and imprecision. A point often raised against the quantum computer is that it is essentially an analogue rather than a digital device, and has many limitations as a result. This is a misconception. It is true that any quantum system has a continuous state space, but so has any classical system, including the circuits of a digital computer. The fault-tolerant methods used to permit error correction in a quantum computer restrict the set of quantum gates to a discrete set, therefore the `legal' states of the quantum computer are discrete, just as in a classical digital computer. The really important difference between analogue and digital computing is that to increase the precision of a result arrived at by analogue means, one must re-engineer the whole computer, whereas with digital methods one need merely increase the number of bits and operations. The faulttolerant quantum computer has more in common with a digital than an analogue device. Shor's algorithm for the factorisation problem stimulated a lot of interest in part because of the connection with data encryption. However, I feel that the significance of Shor's algorithm is not primarily in its possible use for factoring large integers in the distant future. Rather, it has acted as a stimulus to the field, proving the existence of a powerful new type of computing made possible by controlled quantum evolution, and exhibiting some of the new methods. At present, the most practically significant achievement in the general area of quantum information physics is not in computing at all, but in quantum key distribution. The title `quantum computer' will remain a misnomer for any experimental device realised in the next twenty years. It is an abuse of language to call even a pocket calculator a `computer', because the word has come to be reserved for general-purpose machines which more

or less realise Turing's concept of the Universal Machine. The same ought to be true for quantum computers if we do not want to mislead people. However, small quantum information processors may serve useful roles. For example, concepts learned from quantum information theory may permit the discovery of useful new spectroscopic methods in nuclear magnetic resonance. Quantum key distribution could be made more secure, and made possible over larger distances, if small `relay stations' could be built which applied purification or error correction methods. The relay station could be an ion trap combined with a high-Q cavity, which is realisable with current technology. It will surely not be long before a quantum state is teleported from one laboratory to another, a very exciting prospect. The great intrinsic value of a large quantum computer is offset by the difficulty of making one. However, few would argue that this prize does not at least merit a lot of effort to find out just how unattainable, or hopefully attainable, it is. One of the chief uses of a processor which could manipulate a few quantum bits may be to help us better understand decoherence in quantum mechanics. This will be amenable to experimental investigation during the next few years: rather than waiting in hope, there is useful work to be done now. On the theoretical side, there are two major open questions: the nature of quantum algorithms, and the limits on reliability of quantum computing. It is not yet clear what is the essential nature of quantum computing, and what general class of computational problem is amenable to efficient solution by quantum methods. Is there a whole mine of useful quantum algorithms waiting to be delved, or will the supply dry up with the few nuggets we have so far discovered? Can significant computational power be achieved with less than 100 qubits? This is by no means ruled out, since it is hard to simulate even 20 qubits by classical means. Concerning reliability, great progress has been made, so that we can now be cautiously optimistic that quantum computing is not an impossible dream. We can identify requirements sufficient to guarantee reliable computing, involving for example uncorrelated stochastic noise of order 10-5 per gate, and a quantum computer a hundred times larger than the logical machine embedded within it. However, can quantum decoherence be relied upon to have the properties assumed in such an estimate, and if not then can error correction methods

40

still be found? Conversely, once we know more about the noise, it may be possible to identify considerably less taxing requirements for reliable computing. To conclude with, I would like to propose a more wideranging theoretical task: to arrive at a set of principles like energy and momentum conservation, but which apply to information, and from which much of quantum mechanics could be derived. Two tests of such ideas would be whether the EPR-Bell correlations thus became transparent, and whether they rendered obvious the proper use of terms such as `measurement' and `knowledge'. I hope that quantum information physics will be recognised as a valuable part of fundamental physics. The quest to bring together Turing machines, information, number theory and quantum physics is for me, and I hope will be for readers of this review, one of the most fascinating cultural endeavours one could have the good fortune to encounter. I thank the Royal Society and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for their support.

Fig. 1. Maxwell's demon. In this illustration the demon sets up a pressure difference by only raising the partition when more gas molecules approach it from the left than from the right. This can be done in a completely reversible manner, as long as the demon's memory stores the random results of its observations of the molecules. The demon's memory thus gets hotter. The irreversible step is not the acquisition of information, but the loss of information if the demon later clears its memory. Fig. 2. Relationship between quantum mechanics and information theory. This diagram is not intended to be a definitive statement, the placing of entries being to some extent subjective, but it indicates many of the connections discussed in the article.

internal state G. The action consists in overwriting a new symbol s on the current tape location, changing state to G , and moving the tape one place in direction d (left or right). The internal construction of the machine can therefore be specified by a finite fixed list of rules of the form (s, G  s , G , d). One special internal state is the `halt' state: once in this state the machine ceases further activity. An input `programme' on the tape is transformed by the machine into an output result printed on the tape.

It reads one binary symbol at a time, Fig. 12. Ion trap quantum information processor. A supplied on a tape. The machine's action on reading a string of singly-charged atoms is stored in a linear ion given symbol s depends only on that symbol and the trap. The ions are separated by  20 µm by their mu49

tual repulsion. Each ion is addressed by a pair of laser beams which coherently drive both Raman transitions in the ions, and also transitions in the state of motion of the string. The motional degree of freedom serves as a single-qubit `bus' to transport quantum information among the ions. State preparation is by optical pumping and laser cooling; readout is by electron shelving and resonance fluorescence, which enables the state of each ion to be measured with high signal to noise ratio. Message Fig. 13. Bulk nuclear spin resonance quantum information processor. A liquid of  1020 `designer' molecules is placed in a sensitive magnetometer, which can both generate oscillating magnetic fields and also detect the precession of the mean magnetic moment of the liquid. The situation is somewhat like having 1020 independent processors, but the initial state is one of thermal equilibrium, and only the average final state can be detected. The quantum information is stored and manipulated in the nuclear spin states. The spin state energy levels of a given nucleus are influenced by neighbouring nuclei in the molecule, which enables xor gates to be applied. They are little influenced by anything else, owing to the small size of a nuclear magnetic moment, which means the inevitable dephasing of the processors with respect to each other is relatively slow. This dephasing can be undone by `spin echo' methods. Fig. 14. Fault tolerant syndrome extraction, for the QECC given in equations (47),(48). The upper 7 qubits are qc, the lower are the ancilla a. All gates, measurements and free evolution are assumed to be noisy. Only H and 2-qubit xor gates are used; when several xors have the same control or target bit they are shown superimposed, NB this is a non-standard notation. The first part of the network, up until the 7 H gates, prepares a in |0E , and also verifies a: a small box represents a single-qubit measurement. If any measurement gives 1, the preparation is restarted. The H gates transform the state of a to |0E + |1E . Finally, the 7 xor gates between qc and a carry out a single xor in the encoded basis {|0E , |1E }. This operation carries X errors from qc into a, and Z errors from a into qc. The X errors in qc can be deduced from the result of measuring a. A further network is needed to identify Z errors. Such correction never makes qc completely noise-free, but when applied between computational steps it reduces the accumulation of errors to an acceptable level. 0000 0001 0010 0011 0100 0101 0110 0111 1000 1001 1010 1011 1100 1101 1110 1111 Huffman 10 000 001 11000 010 11001 11010 1111000 011 11011 11100 111111 11101 111110 111101 1111001 Hamming 0000000 1010101 0110011 1100110 0001111 1011010 0111100 1101001 1111111 0101010 1001100 0011001 1110000 0100101 1000011 0010110

Table 1: Huffman and Hamming codes. The left column shows the sixteen possible 4-bit messages, the other columns show the encoded version of each message. The Huffman code is for data compression: the most likely messages have the shortest encoded forms; the code is given for the case that each message bit is three times more likely to be zero than one. The Hamming code is an error correcting code: every codeword differs from all the others in at least 3 places, therefore any single error can be corrected. The Hamming code is also linear: all the words are given by linear combinations of 1010101, 0110011, 0001111, 1111111. They satisfy the parity checks 1010101, 0110011, 0001111.

Abstract The subject of quantum computing brings together ideas from classical information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum information theory. Information can be identified as the most general thing which must propagate from a cause to an effect. It therefore has a fundamentally important role in the science of physics. However, the mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, is quite recent, dating from the mid-twentieth century. This has meant that the full significance of information as a basic concept in physics is only now being discovered. This is especially true in quantum mechanics. The theory of quantum information and computing puts this significance on a firm footing, and has lead to some profound and exciting new insights into the natural world. Among these are the use of quantum states to permit the secure transmission of classical information (quantum cryptography), the use of quantum entanglement to permit reliable transmission of quantum states (teleportation), the possibility of preserving quantum coherence in the presence of irreversible noise processes (quantum error correction), and the use of controlled quantum evolution for efficient computation (quantum computation). The common theme of all these insights is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational resource. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, this review begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then outlined, and the EPR experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are next outlined, including qubits and data compression, quantum gates, the `no cloning' property, and teleportation. Quantum cryptography is briefly sketched. The universal quantum computer is described, based on the Church-Turing Principle and a network model of computation. Algorithms for such a computer are discussed, especially those for finding the period of a function, and searching a random list. Such algorithms prove that a quantum computer of sufficiently precise construction is not only fundamentally different from any computer which can only manipulate classical information, but can compute a small class of functions with greater efficiency. This implies that some important computational tasks are impossible for any device apart from a quantum computer. To build a universal quantum computer is well beyond the abilities of current technology. However, the principles of quantum information physics can be tested on smaller devices. The current experimental situation is reviewed, with emphasis on the linear ion trap, high-Q optical cavities, and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. These allow coherent control in a Hilbert space of eight dimensions (3 qubits), and should be extendable up to a thousand or more dimensions (10 qubits). Among other things, these systems will allow the feasibility of quantum computing to be assessed. In fact such experiments are so difficult that it seemed likely until recently that a practically useful quantum computer (requiring, say, 1000 qubits) was actually ruled out by considerations of experimental imprecision and the unavoidable coupling between any system and its environment. However, a further fundamental part of quantum information physics provides a solution to this impasse. This is quantum error correction (QEC). An introduction to quantum error correction is provided. The evolution of the quantum computer is restricted to a carefully chosen sub-space of its Hilbert space. Errors are almost certain to cause a departure from this sub-space. QEC provides a means to detect and undo such departures without upsetting the quantum computation. This achieves the apparently impossible, since the computation preserves quantum coherence even though during its course all the qubits in the computer will have relaxed spontaneously many times. 2

Introduction

The science of physics seeks to ask, and find precise answers to, basic questions about why nature is as it is. Historically, the fundamental principles of physics have been concerned with questions such as "what are things made of?" and "why do things move as they do?" In his Principia, Newton gave very wide-ranging answers to some of these questions. By showing that the same mathamatical equations could describe the motions of everyday objects and of planets, he showed that an everyday object such as a tea pot is made of essentially the same sort of stuff as a planet: the motions of both can be described in terms of their mass and the forces acting on them. Nowadays we would say that both move in such a way as to conserve energy and momentum. In this way, physics allows us to abstract from nature concepts such as energy or momentum which always obey fixed equations, although the same energy might be expressed in many different ways: for example, an electron in the large electronpositron collider at CERN, Geneva, can have the same kinetic energy as a slug on a lettuce leaf. Another thing which can be expressed in many different ways is information. For example, the two statements "the quantum computer is very interesting" and "l'ordinateur quantique est tr`s int´ressant" e e have something in common, although they share no words. The thing they have in common is their information content. Essentially the same information could be expressed in many other ways, for example by substituting numbers for letters in a scheme such as a  97, b  98, c  99 and so on, in which case the english version of the above statement becomes 116 104 101 32 113 117 97 110 116 117 109 . . . . It is very significant that information can be expressed in different ways without losing its essential nature, since this leads to the possibility of the automatic manipulation of information: a machine need only be able to manipulate quite simple things like integers in order to do surprisingly powerful information processing, from document preparation to differential calculus, even to translating between human languages. We are familiar with this now, because of the ubiquitous computer, but even fifty years ago such a widespread significance of automated information processing was not forseen. However, there is one thing that all ways of express5

ing information must have in common: they all use real physical things to do the job. Spoken words are conveyed by air pressure fluctuations, written ones by arrangements of ink molecules on paper, even thoughts depend on neurons (Landauer 1991). The rallying cry of the information physicist is "no information without physical representation!" Conversely, the fact that information is insensitive to exactly how it is expressed, and can be freely translated from one form to another, makes it an obvious candidate for a fundamentally important role in physics, like energy and momentum and other such abstractions. However, until the second half of this century, the precise mathematical treatment of information, especially information processing, was undiscovered, so the significance of information in physics was only hinted at in concepts such as entropy in thermodynamics. It now appears that information may have a much deeper significance. Historically, much of fundamental physics has been concerned with discovering the fundamental particles of nature and the equations which describe their motions and interactions. It now appears that a different programme may be equally important: to discover the ways that nature allows, and prevents, information to be expressed and manipulated, rather than particles to move. For example, the best way to state exactly what can and cannot travel faster than light is to identify information as the speed-limited entity. In quantum mechanics, it is highly significant that the state vector must not contain, whether explicitly or implicitly, more information than can meaningfully be associated with a given system. Among other things this produces the wavefunction symmetry requirements which lead to Bose Einstein and Fermi Dirac statistics, the periodic structure of atoms, and so on. The programme to re-investigate the fundamental principles of physics from the standpoint of information theory is still in its infancy. However, it already appears to be highly fruitful, and it is this ambitious programme that I aim to summarise. Historically, the concept of information in physics does not have a clear-cut origin. An important thread can be traced if we consider the paradox of Maxwell's demon of 1871 (fig. 1) (see also Brillouin 1956). Recall that Maxwell's demon is a creature that opens and closes a trap door between two compartments of a chamber containing gas, and pursues the subversive

policy of only opening the door when fast molecules approach it from the right, or slow ones from the left. In this way the demon establishes a temperature difference between the two compartments without doing any work, in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently permitting a host of contradictions. A number of attempts were made to exorcise Maxwell's demon (see Bennett 1987), such as arguments that the demon cannot gather information without doing work, or without disturbing (and thus heating) the gas, both of which are untrue. Some were tempted to propose that the 2nd law of thermodynamics could indeed be violated by the actions of an "intelligent being." It was not until 1929 that Leo Szilard made progress by reducing the problem to its essential components, in which the demon need merely identify whether a single molecule is to the right or left of a sliding partition, and its action allows a simple heat engine, called Szilard's engine, to be run. Szilard still had not solved the problem, since his analysis was unclear about whether or not the act of measurement, whereby the demon learns whether the molecule is to the left or the right, must involve an increase in entropy. A definitive and clear answer was not forthcoming, surprisingly, until a further fifty years had passed. In the intermediate years digital computers were developed, and the physical implications of information gathering and processing were carefully considered. The thermodynamic costs of elementary information manipulations were analysed by Landauer and others during the 1960s (Landauer 1961, Keyes and Landauer 1970), and those of general computations by Bennett, Fredkin, Toffoli and others during the 1970s (Bennett 1973, Toffoli 1980, Fredkin and Toffoli 1982). It was found that almost anything can in principle be done in a reversible manner, i.e. with no entropy cost at all (Bennett and Landauer 1985). Bennett (1982) made explicit the relation between this work and Maxwell's paradox by proposing that the demon can indeed learn where the molecule is in Szilard's engine without doing any work or increasing any entropy in the environment, and so obtain useful work during one stroke of the engine. However, the information about the molecule's location must then be present in the demon's memory (fig. 1). As more and more strokes are performed, more and more information gathers in the demon's memory.

To complete a thermodynamic cycle, the demon must erase its memory, and it is during this erasure operation that we identify an increase in entropy in the environment, as required by the 2nd law. This completes the essential physics of Maxwell's demon; further subtleties are discussed by Zurek (1989), Caves (1990), and Caves, Unruh and Zurek (1990). The thread we just followed was instructive, but to provide a complete history of ideas relevent to quantum computing is a formidable task. Our subject brings together what are arguably two of the greatest revolutions in twentieth-century science, namely quantum mechanics and information science (including computer science). The relationship between these two giants is illustrated in fig. 2. Classical information theory is founded on the definition of information. A warning is in order here. Whereas the theory tries to capture much of the normal meaning of the term `information', it can no more do justice to the full richness of that term in everyday language than particle physics can encapsulate the everyday meaning of `charm'. `Information' for us will be an abstract term, defined in detail in section 2.1. Much of information theory dates back to seminal work of Shannon in the 1940's (Slepian 1974). The observation that information can be translated from one form to another is encapsulated and quantified in Shannon's noiseless coding theorem (1948), which quantifies the resources needed to store or transmit a given body of information. Shannon also considered the fundamentally important problem of communication in the presence of noise, and established Shannon's main theorem (section 2.4) which is the central result of classical information theory. Error-free communication even in the presence of noise is achieved by means of `error-correcting codes', and their study is a branch of mathematics in its own right. Indeed, the journal IEEE Transactions on Information Theory is almost totally taken up with the discovery and analysis of error-correction by coding. Pioneering work in this area was done by Golay (1949) and Hamming (1950). The foundations of computer science were formulated at roughly the same time as Shannon's information theory, and this is no coincidence. The father of computer science is arguably Alan Turing (1912-1954), and its prophet is Charles Babbage (1791-1871). Babbage

conceived of most of the essential elements of a modern computer, though in his day there was not the technology available to implement his ideas. A century passed before Babbage's Analytical Engine was improved upon when Turing described the Universal Turing Machine in the mid 1930s. Turing's genius (see Hodges 1983) was to clarify exactly what a calculating machine might be capable of, and to emphasise the role of programming, i.e. software, even more than Babbage had done. The giants on whose shoulders Turing stood in order to get a better view were chiefly the mathematicians David Hilbert and Kurt G¨del. o Hilbert had emphasised between the 1890s and 1930s the importance of asking fundamental questions about the nature of mathematics. Instead of asking "is this mathematical proposition true?" Hilbert wanted to ask "is it the case that every mathematical proposition can in principle be proved or disproved?" This was unknown, but Hilbert's feeling, and that of most mathematicians, was that mathematics was indeed complete, so that conjectures such as Goldbach's (that every even number can be written as the sum of two primes) could be proved or disproved somehow, although the logical steps might be as yet undiscovered.

is sufficiently complicated to address highly sophisticated mathematical questions, but sufficiently simple to be subject to detailed analysis. Turing used his machine as a theoretical construct to show that the assumed existence of a mechanical means to establish decidability leads to a contradiction (see section 3.3). In other words, he was initially concerned with quite abstract mathematics rather than practical computation. However, by seriously establishing the idea of automating abstract mathematical proofs rather than merely arithmatic, Turing greatly stimulated the development of general purpose information processing. This was in the days when a "computer" was a person doing mathematics.

Modern computers are neither Turing machines nor Babbage engines, though they are based on broadly similar principles, and their computational power is equivalent (in a technical sense) to that of a Turing machine. I will not trace their development here, since although this is a wonderful story, it would take too long to do justice to the many people involved. Let us just remark that all of this development represents a great improvement in speed and size, but does not involve any change in the essential idea of what a comG¨del destroyed this hope by establishing the existence puter is, or how it operates.

gave arguments which suggested that quantum evolution could be used to compute certain problems more efficiently than any classical computer, but his device was not sufficiently specified to be called a computer, since he assumed that any interaction between adjacent two-state systems could be `ordered', without saying how.

In 1985 an important step forward was taken by Deutsch. Deutsch's proposal is widely considered to represent the first blueprint for a quantum computer, in that it is sufficiently specific and simple to allow real machines to be contemplated, but sufficiently versatile to be a universal quantum simulator, though both points are debatable. Deutsch's system is essentially a line of two-state systems, and looks more like a register machine than a Turing machine (both are universal classical computing machines). Deutsch proved that if the two-state systems could be made to evolve by means of a specific small set of simple operations, then any unitary evolution could be produced, and therefore the evolution could be made to simulate that of any physical system. He also discussed how to produce Turing-like behaviour using the same ideas. Shor discussed both factorisation and discrete logarithms, making use of a quantum Fourier transDeutsch's simple operations are now called quantum form method discovered by Coppersmith (1994) and `gates', since they play a role analogous to that of bi- Deutsch.

The `too slowly' here is fined by two real numbers, so in principle it can store defined in terms of the number of computational steps an infinite amount of classical information. However, required: this number must not increase exponentially a measurement of a spin will only provide a single twowith the size of the input (the precise meaning will be valued answer (spin up/spin down)--there is no way to explained in section 3.1).

Of course Schumacher

In the early 1990's several authors (Deutsch and Jozsa 1992, Berthiaume and Brassard 1992, Bernstein and Vazirani 1993) sought computational tasks which could be solved by a quantum computer more efficiently than any classical computer. Such a quantum algorithm would play a conceptual role similar to that of Bell's inequality, in defining something of the essential nature of quantum mechanics. Initially only very small differences in performance were found, in which quantum mechanics permitted an answer to be found with certainty, as long as the quantum system was noise-free, where a probabilistic classical computer could achieve an answer `only' with high probability. An important advance was made by Simon (1994), who described an efficient quantum algorithm for a (somewhat abstract) problem for which no efficient solution was possible classically, even by probabilistic methods. This inspired Shor (1994) who astonished the community by describing an algorithm which was not only efficient on a quantum computer, but also addressed a central problem in computer science: that of factorising large integers.

stead for a device in which quantum information ideas can be explored, then only a few quantum bits are required, and this will certainly be achieved in the near future. Simple two-bit operations have been carried out in many physics experiments, notably magnetic resonance, and work with three to ten qubits now seems feasible. Notable recent experiments in this regard are those of Brune et. al. (1994), Monroe et. al. (1995b), Turchette et. al. (1995) and Mattle et. al. (1996).

Classical information theory

This and the next section will summarise the classical theory of information and computing. This is textbook material (Minsky 1967, Hamming 1986) but is included here since it forms a background to quantum information and computing, and the article is aimed at physicists to whom the ideas may be new.

X is given by the throw of a die, then p(x) = 1/6 for x  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} so S = - log2 (1/6)  2.58. If X can take N different values, then the information content (or entropy) of X is maximised when the probability distribution p is flat, with every p(x) = 1/N (for example a fair die yields S  2.58, but a loaded die with p(6) = 1/2, p(1 · · · 5) = 1/10 yields S  2.16). This is consistent with the requirement that the information (what we would gain if we learned X) is maximum when our prior knowledge of X is minimum. Thus the maximum information which could in principle be stored by a variable which can take on N different values is log2 (N ). The logarithms are taken to base 2 rather than some other base by convention. The choice dictates the unit of information: S(X) = 1 when X can take two values with equal probability. A twovalued or binary variable thus can contain one unit of information. This unit is called a bit. The two values of a bit are typically written as the binary digits 0 and 1. In the case of a binary variable, we can define p to be the probability that X = 1, then the probability that X = 0 is 1 - p and the information can be written as a function of p alone: H(p) = -p log2 p - (1 - p) log2 (1 - p) (2)

If X is a random variable which has value x with probability p(x), then the information content of X is defined In what follows, the subscript 2 will be dropped on to be logarithms, it is assumed that all logarithms are to S({p(x)}) = - p(x) log2 p(x).

The most basic problem in classical information theory is to obtain a measure of information, that is, of amount of information. Suppose I tell you the value of a number X. How much information have you gained? That will depend on what you already knew about X. For example, if you already knew X was equal to 2, you would learn nothing, no information, from my revelation. On the other hand, if previously your only knowledge was that X was given by the throw of a die, then to learn its value is to gain information. We have met here a basic paradoxical property, which is that information is often a measure of ignorance: the information content (or `self-information') of X is defined to be the information you would gain if you learned the value of X.

Note that the logarithm is taken to base 2, and that S is always positive since probabilities are bounded by p(x)  1. S is a function of the probability distribition of values of X. It is important to remember this, since in what follows we will adopt the standard practice of using the notation S(X) for S({p(x)}). It is understood that S(X) does not mean a function of X, but rather the information content of the variable X. The quantity S(X) is also referred to as an entropy, for obvious reasons.

The probability that Y = y given that X = x is written p(y|x). The conditional entropy S(Y |X) is defined by S(Y |X) = = - - p(x)

By inspection of the definition, we see that S(Y |X) is a measure of how much information on avIf we already know that X = 2, then p(2) = 1 and erage would remain in Y if we were to learn X.

We will measure the information conp(x, y) I(X : Y ) = p(x, y) log (5) tent of X by counting how many bits Alice must send, p(x)p(y) on average, to allow Bob to learn X. Obviously, she x y = S(X) - S(X|Y ) (6) could just send 0 for `no' and 1 for `yes', giving a `bit rate' of one bit per X value communicated. However, From the definition, I(X : Y ) is a measure of how what if X were an essentially random variable, except much X and Y contain information about each other1 . that it is more likely to be `no' than `yes' ?

Data compression

Having pulled the definition of information content, equation (1), out of a hat, our aim is now to prove that this is a good measure of information. It is not obvious at first sight even how to think about such a task. One of the main contributions of classical information theory is to provide useful ways to think about information. We will describe a simple situation in order to illustrate the methods. Let us suppose one person, traditionally called Alice, knows the value of X, and she wishes to communicate it to Bob. We restrict ourselves to the simple case that X has only two
1 Many authors write I(X; Y ) rather than I(X : Y ). I prefer the latter since the symmetry of the colon reflects the fact that I(X : Y ) = I(Y : X).

Now, it can be shown that the probability that Alice's n values actually form a typical sequence is greater than 1 - , for sufficiently large n, no matter how small  is. This implies that Alice need not communicate n bits to Bob in order for him to learn n decisions. She need only tell Bob which typical sequence she has. They must agree together beforehand how the typical sequences are to be labelled: for example, they may agree to number them in order of increasing binary value. Alice just sends the label, not the sequence itself. To deduce how well this works, it can be shown that the typical sequences all have equal probability, and there are 2nH(p) of them. To communicate one of 2nH(p) possibilities, clealy Alice must send nH(p) bits. Also, Alice cannot do better than this (i.e. send fewer bits) since the typical sequences are equiprobable: there is nothing to be gained by further manipu-

The above argument has already yielded a significant practical result associated with (1). This is that to communicate n values of X, we need only send nS(X)  n bits down a communication channel. This idea is referred to as data compression, and is also called Shannon's noiseless coding theorem. The typical sequences idea has given a means to calculate information content, but it is not the best way to compress information in practice, because Alice must wait for a large number of decisions to accumulate before she communicates anything to Bob. A better method is for Alice to accumulate a few decisions, say 4, and communicate this as a single `message' as best she can. Huffman derived an optimal method whereby Alice sends short strings to communicate the most likely messages, and longer ones to communicate the least likely messages, see table 1 for an example. The translation process is referred to as `encoding' and `decoding' (fig. 4); this terminology does not imply any wish to keep information secret.

2.3

The binary symmetric channel

So far we have considered the case of communication down a perfect, i.e. noise-free channel. We have gained two main results of practical value: a measure of the best possible data compression (Shannon's noiseless coding theorem), and a practical method to compress data (Huffman coding). We now turn to the important question of communication in the presence of noise. As in the last section, we will analyse the simplest case in order to illustrate principles which are in fact more general. Suppose we have a binary channel, i.e. one which allows Alice to send noughts and ones to Bob. The noisefree channel conveys 0  0 and 1  1, but a noisy channel might sometimes cause 0 to become 1 and vice versa. There is an infinite variety of different types of noise. For example, the erroneous `bit flip' 0  1 might be just as likely as 1  0, or the channel might have a tendency to `relax' towards 0, in which case 1  0 happens but 0  1 does not. Also, such errors might occur independently from bit to bit, or occur in bursts.

For the case p = 1/4 Shannon's noiseless coding theorem tells us that the best possible data compression technique would communicate each message of four X A very important type of noise is one which affects values by sending on average 4H(1/4)  3.245 bits. different bits independently, and causes both 0  1 14

and 1  0 errors. This is important because it captures the essential features of many processes encountered in realistic situations. If the two errors 0  1 and 1  0 are equally likely, then the noisy channel is called a `binary symmetric channel'. The binary symmetric channel has a single parameter, p, which is the error probability per bit sent. Suppose the message sent into the channel by Alice is X, and the noisy message which Bob receives is Y . Bob is then faced with the task of deducing X as best he can from Y . If X consists of a single bit, then Bob will make use of the conditional probabilities p(x = 0|y = 0) = p(x = 1|y = 1) = 1 - p p(x = 0|y = 1) = p(x = 1|y = 0) = p giving S(X|Y ) = H(p) using equations (3) and (2). Therefore, from the definition (6) of mutual information, we have I(X : Y ) = S(X) - H(p) (13)

simple. From equations (13) and (14) one may see that the answer is C(p) = 1 - H(p), (15)

obtained when S(X) = 1 (i.e. P (x = 0) = P (x = 1) = 1/2).

2.4

Error-correcting codes

Clearly, the presence of noise in the channel limits the information about Alice's X contained in Bob's received Y . Also, because of the data processing inequality, equation (7), Bob cannot increase his information about X by manipulating Y . However, (13) shows that Alice and Bob can communicate better if S(X) is large. The general insight is that the information communicated depends both on the source and the properties of the channel. It would be useful to have a measure of the channel alone, to tell us how well it conveys information. This quantity is called the capacity of the channel and it is defined to be the maximum possible mutual information I(X : Y ) between the input and output of the channel, maximised over all possible sources: Channel capacity C  max I(X : Y )
{p(x)}

So far we have investigated how much information gets through a noisy channel, and how much is lost. Alice cannot convey to Bob more information than C(p) per symbol communicated. However, suppose Bob is busy defusing a bomb and Alice is shouting from a distance which wire to cut : she will not say "the blue wire" just once, and hope that Bob heard correctly. She will repeat the message many times, and Bob will wait until he is sure to have got it right. Thus error-free communication can be achieved even over a noisy channel. In this example one obtains the benefit of reduced error rate at the sacrifice of reduced information rate. The next stage of our information theoretic programme is to identify more powerful techniques to circumvent noise (Hamming 1986, Hill 1986, Jones 1979, MacWilliams and Sloane 1977).

We will need the following concepts. The set {0, 1} is considered as a group (a Galois field GF(2)) where the operations +, -, ×, ÷ are carried out modulo 2 (thus, 1 + 1 = 0). An n-bit binary word is a vector of n components, for example 011 is the vector (0, 1, 1). A set of such vectors forms a vector space under addition, since for example 011 + 101 means (0, 1, 1) + (1, 0, 1) = (0+1, 1+0, 1+1) = (1, 1, 0) = 110 by the standard rules of vector addition. This is equivalent to the exclusiveor operation carried out bitwise between the two binary (14) words.

Channel capacity is measured in units of `bits out per The effect of noise on a word u can be expressed u  symbol in' and for binary channels must lie between u = u + e, where the error vector e indicates which zero and one. bits in u were flipped by the noise. For example, u = 1001101  u = 1101110 can be expressed u = u + It is all very well to have a definition, but (14) does 0100011. An error correcting code C is a set of words not allow us to compare channels very easily, since we such that have to perform the maximisation over input strategies, u + e = v + f u, v  C (u = v), e, f  E (16) which is non-trivial. To establish the capacity C(p) of the binary symmetric channel is a basic problem in where E is the set of errors correctable by C, which ininformation theory, but fortunately this case is quite cludes the case of no error, e = 0. To use such a code, 15

Alice and Bob agree on which codeword u corresponds to which message, and Alice only ever sends codewords down the channel. Since the channel is noisy, Bob receives not u but u + e. However, Bob can deduce u unambiguously from u + e since by condition (16), no other codeword v sent by Alice could have caused Bob to receive u + e.

noise by error correction coding and decoding, that is, by information processing! The meaning of Shannon's theorem is illustrated by fig. 5. The main problem of coding theory is to identify codes with large rate k/n and large distance d. These two conditions are mutually incompatible, so a compromise is needed. The problem is notoriously difficult and has no general solution. To make connection with quantum error correction, we will need to mention one important concept, that of the parity check matrix. An error correcting code is called linear if it is closed under addition, i.e. u + v  C u, v  C. Such a code is completely specified by its parity check matrix H, which is a set of (n - k) linearly independent n-bit words satisfying H · u = 0 u  C. The important property is encapsulated by the following equation:

An example error-correcting code is shown in the righthand column of table 1. This is a [7, 4, 3] Hamming code, named after its discoverer. The notation [n, k, d] means that the codewords are n bits long, there are 2k of them, and they all differ from each other in at least d places. Because of the latter feature, the condition (16) is satisfied for any error which affects at most one bit. In other words the set E of correctable errors is {0000000,1000000,0100000,0010000, 0001000,0000100,0000010, 0000001}. Note that E can H · (u + e) = (H · u) + (H · e) = H · e. (17) have at most 2n-k members. The ratio k/n is called the rate of the code, since each block of n transmitted This states that if Bob evaluates H · u for his noisy rebits conveys k bits of information, thus k/n bits per ceived word u = u + e, he will obtain the same answer H · e, no matter what word u Alice sent him! If this bit. evaluation were done automatically, Bob could learn The parameter d is called the `minimum distance' of H · e, called the error syndrome, without learning u. If the code, and is important when encoding for noise Bob can deduce the error e from H · e, which one can which affects successive bits independently, as in the show is possible for all correctable errors, then he can binary symmetric channel. For, a code of minumum correct the message (by subtracting e from it) without distance d can correct all errors affecting less than d/2 ever learning what it was! In quantum error correcbits of the transmitted codeword, and for independent tion, this is the origin of the reason one can correct a noise this is the most likely set of errors. In fact, the quantum state without disturbing it. probability that an n-bit word receives m errors is given by the binomial distribution (11), so if the code can correct more than the mean number of errors np, the 3 Classical theory of computacorrection is highly likely to succeed. The central result of classical information theory is that powerful error correcting codes exist: Shannon's theorem: If the rate k/n < C(p) and n is sufficiently large, there exists a binary code allowing transmission with an arbitrarily small error probability.

tion
We now turn to the theory of computation. This is mostly concerned with the questions "what is computable?" and "what resources are necessary?"

The fundamental resources required for computing are a means to store and to manipulate symbols. The important questions are such things as how complicated The error probability here is the probability that an must the symbols be, how many will we need, how comuncorrectable error occurs, causing Bob to misinter- plicated must the manipulations be, and how many of pret the received word. Shannon's theorem is highly them will we need? surprising, since it implies that it is not necessary to engineer very low-noise communication channels, an ex- The general insight is that computation is deemed hard pensive and difficult task. Instead, we can compensate or inefficient if the amount of resources required rises 16

exponentially with a measure of the size of the problem to be addressed. The size of the problem is given by the amount of information required to specify the problem. Applying this idea at the most basic level, we find that a computer must be able to manipulate binary symbols, not just unary symbols2 , otherwise the number of memory locations needed would grow exponentially with the amount of information to be manipulated. On the other hand, it is not necessary to work in decimal notation (10 symbols) or any other notation with an `alphabet' of more than two symbols. This greatly simplifies computer design and analysis. To manipulate n binary symbols, it is not necessary to manipulate them all at once, since it can be shown that any transformation can be brought about by manipulating the binary symbols one at a time or in pairs. A binary `logic gate' takes two bits x, y as inputs, and calculates a function f (x, y). Since f can be 0 or 1, and there are four possible inputs, there are 16 possible functions f . This set of 16 different logic gates is called a `universal set', since by combining such gates in series, any transformation of n bits can be carried out. Futhermore, the action of some of the 16 gates can be reproduced by combining others, so we do not need all 16, and in fact only one, the nand gate, is necessary (nand is not and, for which the output is 0 if and only if both inputs are 1).

T (x) for the output of a Turing machine T (fig. 7) acting on input tape x. Now, a Turing machine can be completely specified by writing down how it responds to 0 and 1 on the input tape, for every possible internal configuration of the machine (of which there are a finite number). This specification can itself be written as a binary number d[T ]. Turing showed that there exists a machine U , called a universal Turing machine, with the properties U (d[T ], x) = T (x) (18)

and the number of steps taken by U to simulate each step of T is only a polynomial (not exponential) function of the length of d[T ]. In other words, if we provide U with an input tape containing both a description of T and the input x, then U will compute the same function as T would have done, for any machine T , without an exponential slow-down.

To complete the argument, it can be shown that other models of computation, such as the network model, are computationally equivalent to the Turing model: they permit the same functions to be computed, with the same computational efficiency (see next section). Thus the concept of the univeral machine establishes that a certain finite degree of complexity of construction is sufficient to allow very general information processing. This is the fundamental result of computer science. InBy concatenating logic gates, we can manipulate n-bit deed, the power of the Turing machine and its cousins is symbols (see fig. 6). This general approach is called so great that Church (1936) and Turing (1936) framed the network model of computation, and is useful for the "Church-Turing thesis," to the effect that our purposes because it suggests the model of quantum computation which is currently most feasible ex- Every function `which would naturally be regarded as perimentally.

3.2

Computational complexity

Once we have established the idea of a universal computer, computational tasks can be classified in terms of their difficulty in the following manner. A given algorithm is deemed to address not just one instance of a problem, such as "find the square of 237," but one class of problem, such as "given x, find its square." The amount of information given to the computer in order to specify the problem is L = log x, i.e. the number of bits needed to store the value of x. The computational complexity of the problem is determined by the number of steps s a Turing machine must make in order to complete any algorithmic method to solve the problem. In the network model, the complexity is determined by the number of logic gates required. If an algorithm exists with s given by any polynomial function of L (eg s  L3 + L) then the problem is deemed tractable and is placed in the complexity class "p". If s rises exponentially with l (eg s  2L = x) then the problem is hard and is in another complexity class. It is often easier to verify a solution, that is, to test whether or not it is correct, than to find one. The class "np" is the set of problems for which solutions can be verified in polynomial time. Obviously p  np, and one would guess that there are problems in np which are not in p, (i.e. np = p) though surprisingly the latter has never been proved, since it is very hard to rule out the possible existence of as yet undiscovered algorithms. However, the important point is that the membership of these classes does not depend on the model of computation, i.e. the physical realisation of the computer, since the Turing machine can simulate any other computer with only a polynomial, rather than exponential slow-down. An important example of an intractable problem is that of factorisation: given a composite (i.e. nonprime) number x, the task is to find one of its factors. If x is even, or a multiple of any small number, then it is easy to find a factor. The interesting case is when the prime factors of x are all themselves large. In this case there is no known simple method. The best known method, the number field sieve (Menezes et. al. 1997) requires a number of computational steps of order s  exp(2L1/3 (log L)2/3 ) where L = ln x. By devoting a substantial machine network to this task, one can today factor a number of 130 decimal digits (Crandall 1997), i.e. L  300, giving s  1018 . This is time-consuming but possible (for example 42 days at

1012 operations per second). However, if we double L, s increases to  1025 , so now the problem is intractable: it would take a million years with current technology, or would require computers running a million times faster than current ones. The lesson is an important one: a computationally `hard' problem is one which in practice is not merely difficult but impossible to solve. The factorisation problem has acquired great practical importance because it is at the heart of widely used cyptographic systems such as that of Rivest, Shamir and Adleman (1979) (see Hellman 1979). For, given a message M (in the form of a long binary number), it is easy to calculate an encrypted version E = M s mod c where s and c are well-chosen large integers which can be made public. To decrypt the message, the receiver calculates E t mod c which is equal to M for a value of t which can be quickly deduced from s and the factors of c (Schroeder 1984). In practice c = pq is chosen to be the product of two large primes p, q known only to the user who published c, so only that user can read the messages--unless someone manages to factorise c. It is a very useful feature that no secret keys need be distributed in such a system: the `key' c, s allowing encryption is public knowledge.

3.3

Uncomputable functions

There is an even stronger way in which a task may be impossible for a computer. In the quest to solve some problem, we could `live with' a slow algorithm, but what if one does not exist at all? Such problems are termed uncomputable. The most important example is the "halting problem", a rather beautiful result. A feature of computers familiar to programmers is that they may sometimes be thrown into a never-ending loop. Consider, for example, the instruction "while x > 2, divide x by 1" for x initially greater than 2. We can see that this algorithm will never halt, without actually running it. More interesting from a mathematical point of view is an algorithm such as "while x is equal to the sum of two primes, add 2 to x, otherwise print x and halt", beginning at x = 8. The algorithm is certainly feasible since all pairs of primes less than x can be found and added systematically. Will such an algorithm ever halt? If so, then a counterexample to the Goldbach conjecture exists. Using such techniques, a vast section of mathematical and physical theory could

18

be reduced to the question "would such and such an algorithm halt if we were to run it?" If we could find a general way to establish whether or not algorithms will halt, we would have an extremely powerful mathematical tool. In a certain sense, it would solve all of mathematics! Let us suppose that it is possible to find a general algorithm which will work out whether any Turing machine will halt on any input. Such an algorithm solves the problem "given x and d[T ], would Turing machine T halt if it were fed x as input?". Here d[T ] is the description of T . If such an algorithm exists, then it is possible to make a Turing machine TH which halts if and only if T (d[T ]) does not halt, where d[T ] is the description of T . Here TH takes as input d[T ], which is sufficient to tell TH about both the Turing machine T and the input to T . Hence we have TH (d[T ]) halts  T (d[T ]) does not halt (19)

So far everything is ok. However, what if we feed TH the description of itself, d[TH ]? Then TH (d[TH ]) halts  TH (d[TH ]) does not halt (20) which is a contradiction. By this argument Turing showed that there is no automatic means to establish whether Turing machines will halt in general: the "halting problem" is uncomputable. This implies that mathematics, and information processing in general, is a rich body of different ideas which cannot all be summarised in one grand algorithm. This liberating observation is closely related to G¨del's theorem. o

The fourth postulate, which has not been made explicit, is a subject of some debate, since quite different interpretive approaches lead to the same predictions, and the concept of `measurement' is fraught with ambiguities in quantum mechanics (Wheeler and Zurek 1983, Bell 1987, Peres 1993).

The change |  |k can be expressed by the projection operator (|k k|)/ k | . The principles of quantum mechanics suggest that the answer to the first quesion is yes3 . For, the state vector | so central to quantum mechanics is a concept very much like those of information science: it is an abstract entity which contains exactly all the information about the system Q. The word `exactly' here is a reminder that not only is | a complete description of Q, it is also one that does not contain any extraneous information which can not meaningfully be associated with Q. The importance of this in quantum statistics of Fermi and Bose gases was mentioned in the introduction.

physics, Every finitely realizible physical system can be simulated arbitrarily closely by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means. This statement is based on that of Deutsch (1985). The idea is to propose that a principle like this is not derived from quantum mechanics, but rather underpins it, like other principles such as that of conservation of energy. The qualifications introduced by `finitely realizible' and `finite means' are important in order to state something useful. The new version of the Church-Turing thesis (now called the `Church-Turing Principle') does not refer to Turing machines. This is important because there are fundamental differences between the very nature of the Turing machine and the principles of quantum mechanics. One is described in terms of operations on classical bits, the other in terms of evolution of quantum states. Hence there is the possibility that the universal Turing machine, and hence all classical computers, might not be able to simulate some of the behaviour to be found in Nature. Conversely, it may be physically possible (i.e. not ruled out by the laws of Nature) to realise a new type of computation essentially different from that of classical computer science. This is the central aim of quantum computing.

particles are prepared initially in the singlet state  (| | - | | )/ 2, and they subsequently fly apart, propagating in opposite directions along the y-axis. Alice and Bob are widely separated, and they receive particle A and B respectively. EPR were concerned with whether quantum mechanics provides a complete description of the particles, or whether something was left out, some property of the spin angular momenta sA , sB which quantum theory failed to describe. Such a property has since become known as a `hidden variable'. They argued that something was left out, because this experiment allows one to predict with certainty the result of measuring any component of sB , without causing any disturbance of B. Therefore all the components of sB have definite values, say EPR, and the quantum theory only provides an incomplete description. To make the certain prediction without disturbing B, one chooses any axis  along which one wishes to know B's angular momentum, and then measures not B but A, using a Stern-Gerlach apparatus aligned along . Since the singlet state carries no net angular momentum, one can be sure that the corresponding measurement on B would yield the opposite result to the one obtained for A.

The EPR paper is important because it is carefully argued, and the fallacy is hard to unearth. The fallacy can be exposed in one of two ways: one can say either that Alice's measurement does influence Bob's particle, or (which I prefer) that the quantum state vector | is not an intrinsic property of a quantum system, but an expression for the information content of a quantum 4.1 EPR paradox, Bell's inequality variable. In a singlet state there is mutual information between A and B, so the information content of In 1935 Einstein, Podolski and Rosen (EPR) drew B changes when we learn something about A. So far attention to an important feature of non-relativistic there is no difference from the behaviour of classical quantum mechanics. Their argument, and Bell's anal- information, so nothing surprising has occurred. ysis, can now be recognised as one of the seeds from which quantum information theory has grown. The A more thorough analysis of the EPR experiment EPR paradox should be familiar to any physics gradu- yields a big surprise.

Each measurement yields an answer + or -. Quantum theory and experiment agree The EPR thought-experiment can be reduced in that the probability for the two measurements to yield essence to an experiment involving pairs of two-state the same result is sin2 ((A - B )/2), where A (B ) quantum systems (Bohm 1951, Bohm and Aharonov is the angle between A (B ) and the z axis.

Feynman (1982) gives a particularly clear analysis. At A - B = 120 the highest correlation which local hidden variables could produce is 2/3. The Bell-EPR argument allows us to identify a task which is physically possible, but which no classical computer could perform: when repeatedly given inputs A , B at completely separated locations, respond quickly (i.e. too quick to allow light-speed communication between the locations) with yes/no responses which are perfectly correlated when A = B + 180, anticorrelated when A = B , and more than  70% correlated when A - B = 120 . Experimental tests of Bell's argument were carried out in the 1970's and 80's and the quantum theory was verified (Clauser and Shimony 1978, Aspect et. al. 1982; for more recent work see Aspect (1991), Kwiat et. al. 1995 and references therein). This was a significant new probe into the logical structure of quantum mechanics. The argument can be made even stronger by considering a more complicated system. In particular, for three spins  prepared in a state such as (| | | + | | | )/ 2, Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger (1989) (GHZ) showed that a single measurement along a horizontal axis for two particles, and along a vertical axis for the third, will yield with certainty a result which is the exact opposite of what a local hidden-variable theory would predict. A wider discussion and references are provided by Greenberger et. al. (1990), Mermin (1990).

Quantum Information

Just as in the discussion of classical information theory, quantum information ideas are best introduced by stating them, and then showing afterwards how they link together. Quantum communication is treated in a special issue of J. Mod. Opt., volume 41 (1994); reviews and references for quantum cryptography are given by Bennett et. al. (1992); Hughes et. al. (1995); Phoenix and Townsend (1995); Brassard and Crepeau (1996); Ekert (1997). Spiller (1996) reviews both communication and computing.

5.1

Qubits

The elementary unit of quantum information is the qubit (Schumacher 1995). A single qubit can be envisaged as a two-state system such as a spin-half or a twolevel atom (see fig. 12), but when we measure quantum information in qubits we are really doing something more abstract: a quantum system is said to have n qubits if it has a Hilbert space of 2n dimensions, and so has available 2n mutually orthogonal quantum states (recall that n classical bits can represent up to 2n different things). This definition of the qubit will be elaborated in section 5.6. We will write two orthogonal states of a single qubit as {|0 , |1 }. More generally, 2n mutually orthogonal states of n qubits can be written {|i }, where i is an n-bit binary number. For example, for three qubits we have {|000 , |001 , |010 , |011 , |100 , |101 , |110 , |111 }.

The Bell-EPR correlations show that quantum mechanics permits at least one simple task which is be- 5.2 Quantum gates yond the capabilities of classical computers, and they hint at a new type of mutual information (Schumacher Simple unitary operations on qubits are called quanand Nielsen 1996). In order to pursue these ideas, we tum `logic gates' (Deutsch 1985, 1989). For example, will need to construct a complete theory of quantum if a qubit evolves as |0  |0 , |1  exp(it) |1 , then information. after time t we may say that the operation, or `gate' P () = 1 0 0 ei (22)

has been applied to the qubit, where  = t. This can also be written P () = |0 0|+ exp(i) |1 1|. Here are 22

some other elementary quantum gates: I X Z Y H  |0 0| + |1 1| = identity  |0 1| + |1 0| = not (23) (24)

 P () (25)  XZ (26) 1   (|0 + |1 ) 0| + (|0 - |1 ) 1| (27) 2

these all act on a single qubit, and can be achieved by the action of some Hamiltonian in Schr¨dinger's equao tion, since they are all unitary operators4 . There are an infinite number of single-qubit quantum gates, in contrast to classical information theory, where only two logic gates are possible for a single bit, namely the identity and the logical not operation. The quantum not gate carries |0 to |1 and vice versa, and so is analagous to a classical not. This gate is also called X since it is the Pauli x operator. Note that the set {I, X, Y, Z} is a group under multiplication. Of all the possible unitary operators acting on a pair of qubits, an interesting subset is those which can be written |0 0|I+|1 1|U , where I is the single-qubit identity operation, and U is some other single-qubit gate. Such a two-qubit gate is called a "controlled U " gate, since the action I or U on the second qubit is controlled by whether the first qubit is in the state |0 or |1 . For example, the effect of controlled-not ("cnot") is |00 |01  |00  |01

3-qubit "controlled-controlled-not" gate, in which the third qubit experiences not if and only if both the others are in the state |1 . This gate is named a Toffoli gate, after Toffoli (1980) who showed that the classical version is universal for classical reversible computation. The effect on a state |a |b |0 is a  a, b  b, 0  a·b. In other words if the third qubit is prepared in |0 then this gate computes the and of the first two qubits. The use of three qubits is necessary in order to permit the whole operation to be unitary, and thus allowed in quantum mechanical evolution. It is an amusing excercise to find the combinations of gates which perform elementary arithmatical operations such as binary addition and multiplication. Many basic constructions are given by Barenco et. al. (1995b), further general design considerations are discussed by Vedral et. al. (1996) and Beckman et. al. (1996). The action of a sequence of quantum gates can be written in operator notation, for example X1 H2 xor1,3 | where | is some state of three qubits, and the subscripts on the operators indicate to which qubits they apply. However, once more than a few quantum gates are involved, this notation is rather obscure, and can usefully be replaced by a diagram known as a quantum network--see fig. 8. These diagrams will be used hereafter.

5.3

No cloning

|10 |11

 |11  |10

No cloning theorem: An unknown quantum state can(28) not be cloned.

This states that it is impossible to generate copies of a quantum state reliably, unless the state is already known (i.e. unless there exists classical information which specifies it). Proof: to generate a copy of a quantum state | , we must cause a pair of quantum systems to undergo the evolution U (| |0 ) = | | where U is the unitary evolution operator. If this is to work for any state, then U must not depend on , and therefore U (| |0 ) = | | for | = | . HowOther logical operations require further qubits. For  example, the and operation is achieved by use of the ever, if we consider the state | = (| + | )/ 2, we  have U (| |0 ) = (| | + | | )/ 2 = | | so the 4 The letter H is adopted for the final gate here because its effect is a Hadamard transformation. This is not to be confused cloning operation fails. This argument applies to any purported cloning method (Wooters and Zurek 1982, with the Hamiltonian H. Here the second qubit undergoes a not if and only if the first qubit is in the state |1 . This list of state changes is the analogue of the truth table for a classical binary logic gate. The effect of controlled-not acting on a state |a |b can be written a  a, b  ab, where  signifies the exclusive or (xor) operation. For this reason, this gate is also called the xor gate. 23

Dieks 1982). Note that any given `cloning' operation U can work on some states (| and | in the above example), though since U is trace-preserving, two different clonable states must be orthogonal, |  = 0. Unless we already know that the state to be copied is one of these states, we cannot guarantee that the chosen U will correctly clone it. This is in contrast to classical information, where machines like photocopiers can easily copy whatever classical information is sent to them. The controlled-not or xor operation of equation (28) is a copying operation for the states  and |0 |1 , but not for states such as |+  (|0 + |1 )/ 2 and  |-  (|0 - |1 )/ 2. The no-cloning theorem and the EPR paradox together reveal a rather subtle way in which non-relativistic quantum mechanics is a consistent theory. For, if cloning were possible, then EPR correlations could be used to communicate faster than light, which leads to a contradiction (an effect preceding a cause) once the principles of special relativity are taken into account. To see this, observe that by generating many clones, and then measuring them in different bases, Bob could deduce unambiguously whether his member of an EPR pair is in a state of the basis {|0 , |1 } or of the basis {|+ , |- }. Alice would communicate instanteously by forcing the EPR pair into one basis or the other through her choice of measurement axis (Glauber 1986).

Suppose now that Alice and Bob are in possession of an entangled pair of qubits, in the state |00 + |11  (we will usually drop normalisation factors such as 2 from now on, to keep the notation uncluttered). Alice and Bob need never have communicated: we imagine a mechanical central facility generating entangled pairs and sending one qubit to each of Alice and Bob, who store them (see fig. 9a). In this situation, Alice can communicate two classical bits by sending Bob only one qubit (namely her half of the entangled pair). This idea due to Wiesner (Bennett and Wiesner 1992) is called "dense coding", since only one quantum bit travels from Alice to Bob in order to convey two classical bits. Two quantum bits are involved, but Alice only ever sees one of them. The method relies on the following fact: the four mutually orthogonal states |00 + |11 , |00 - |11 , |01 + |10 , |01 - |10 can be generated from each other by operations on a single qubit. This set of states is called the Bell basis, since they exhibit the strongest possible Bell-EPR correlations (Braunstein et. al. 1992). Starting from |00 + |11 , Alice can generate any of the Bell basis states by operating on her qubit with one of the operators {I, X, Y, Z}. Since there are four possibilities, her choice of operation represents two bits of classical information. She then sends her qubit to Bob, who must deduce which Bell basis state the qubits are in. This he does by operating on the pair with the xor gate, and measuring the target bit, thus distinguishing |00 ±|11 from |01 ± |10 . To find the sign in the superposition, he operates with H on the remaining qubit, and measures it. Hence Bob obtains two classical bits with no ambiguity. Dense coding is difficult to implement, and so has no practical value merely as a standard communication method. However, it can permit secure communication: the qubit sent by Alice will only yield the two classical information bits to someone in possession of the entangled partner qubit. More generally, dense coding is an example of the statement which began this section. It reveals a relationship between classical information, qubits, and the information content of quantum entanglement (Barenco and Ekert 1995). A laboratory demonstration of the main features is described by Mattle et. al. (1996); Weinfurter (1994) and Braunstein and Mann (1995) discuss some of the methods employed, based on a source of EPR photon pairs from parametric down-conversion.

5.4

Dense coding

We will discuss the following statement: Quantum entanglement is an information resource. Qubits can be used to store and transmit classical information. To transmit a classical bit string 00101, for example, Alice can send 5 qubits prepared in the state |00101 . The receiver Bob can extract the information by measuring each qubit in the basis {|0 , |1 } (i.e. these are the eigenstates of the measured observable). The measurement results yield the classical bit string with no ambiguity. No more than one classical bit can be communicated for each qubit sent.

A suitable quanQuantum teleportation (Bennett et. al. 1993, Bennett 1995) permits a way around this limitation. As in dense coding, we will use quantum entanglement as an information resource. Suppose Alice and Bob possess an entangled pair in the state |00 + |11 . Alice wishes to transmit to Bob a qubit in an unknown state | . Without loss of generality, we can write | = a |0 + b |1 where a and b are unknown coefficients. Then the initial state of all three qubits is a |000 + b |100 + a |011 + b |111 (29) tity is the Von Neumann entropy S() = -Tr log  (31)

5.5

Quantum teleportation

Alice now measures in the Bell basis the first two qubits, i.e. the unknown one and her member of the entangled pair. The network to do this is shown in fig. 9b. After Alice has applied the xor and Hadamard gates, and just before she measures her qubits, the state is + |10 (a |0 - b |1 ) + |11 (a |1 - b |0 ) . (30) Alice's measurements collapse the state onto one of four different possibilities, and yield two classical bits. The two bits are sent to Bob, who uses them to learn which of the operators {I, X, Z, Y } he must apply to his qubit in order to place it in the state a |0 + b |1 = | . Thus Bob ends up with the qubit (i.e. the quantum information, not the actual quantum system) which Alice wished to transmit. Note that the quantum information can only arrive at Bob if it disappears from Alice (no cloning). Also, |00 (a |0 + b |1 ) + |01 (a |1 + b |0 )

where Tr is the trace operation, and  is the density operator describing an ensemble of states of the quantum system. This is to be compared with the classical Shannon entropy, equation (1). Suppose a classical random variable X has a probability distribution p(x). If a quantum system is prepared in a state |x dictated by the value of X, then the density matrix is x p(x) |x x|, where the states |x need not be orthogonal. It can be shown (Kholevo 1973, Levitin 1987) that S() is an upper limit on the classical mutual information I(X : Y ) between X and the result Y of a measurement on the system. To make connection with qubits, we consider the resources needed to store or transmit the state of a quantum system q of density matrix . The idea is to collect n  1 such systems, and transfer (`encode') the joint state into some smaller system. The smaller system is transmitted down the channel, and at the receiving end the joint state is `decoded' into n systems q  of the same type as q (see fig. 9c). The final density matrix of each q  is  , and the whole process is deemed successful if  is sufficiently close to . The measure of the similarity between two density matrices is the fidelity defined by f (,  ) = Tr 1/2  1/2

Next, Alice and Bob inform each other publicly (i.e. anyone can listen in) of the basis they used to prepare or measure each qubit. They find out on which occasions they by chance used the same basis, which happens on average half the time, and retain just those results. In the absence of errors or interference, they now share the same random string of n classical bits (they agree for example to associate |0 and |+ with 0; |1 and |- with 1). This classical bit string is often called the raw quantum transmission, RQT.

two steps. The first is to detect and remove errors, which is done by publicly comparing parity checks on publicly chosen random subsets of the bits, while discarding bits to prevent increasing Eve's information. The second step is to decrease Eve's knowledge of the key, by distilling from it a smaller key, composed of parity values calculated from the original key. In this way a key of around n/4 bits is obtained, of which Eve probably knows less than 10-6 of one bit (Bennett et. al. 1992).

This low light level is necessary so that by Alice, so overall Eve corrupts n/4 bits of the RQT. pulses containing more than one photon are unlikely.

namely, the quantum computer (QC). Ekert and Jozsa (1996) and Barenco (1996) give introductory reviews concentrating on the quantum computer and factorisation; a review with emphasis on practicalities is provided by Spiller (1996). Introductory material is also provided by DiVincenzo (1995b) and Shor (1996). The QC is first and foremost a machine which is a theoretical construct, like a thought-experiment, whose purpose is to allow quantum information processing to be formally analysed. In particular it establishes the Church-Turing Principle introduced in section 4.

by its repeated use on different combinations of bits can generate the action of any other gate. What is the set of all possible quantum gates, however? To answer this, we appeal to the principles of quantum mechanics (Schr¨dinger's equation), and answer that o since all quantum evolution is unitary, it is sufficient to be able to generate all unitary transformations of the n qubits in the computer. This might seem a tall order, since we have a continuous and therefore infinite set. However, it turns out that quite simple quantum gates can be universal, as Deutsch showed in 1985.

The simplest way to think about universal gates is to Here is a prescription for a quantum computer, based consider the pair of gates V (, ) and controlled-not on that of Deutsch (1985, 1989): (or xor), where V (, ) is a general rotation of a single qubit, ie A quantum computer is a set of n qubits in which the cos(/2) -ie-i sin(/2) following operations are experimentally feasible: V (, ) = .

The qubits do not evolve other than via the above qubit rotations by repeated application; however, a practical system need not use such laborious methods. transformations. The xor and rotation operations can be combined to make a controlled rotation which is a single univerThis prescription is incomplete in certain technical sal gate. Such universal quantum gates were discussed ways to be discussed, but it encompasses the main by Deutsch et. al. (1995), Lloyd (1995), DiVincenzo ideas. The model of computation we have in mind is (1995a) and Barenco (1995). a network model, in which logic gates are applied sequentially to a set of bits (here, quantum bits). In an It is remarkable that 2-qubit gates are sufficient for electronic classical computer, logic gates are spread out quantum computation. This is why the quantum gate in space on a circuit board, but in the QC we typically is a powerful and important concept. imagine the logic gates to be interactions turned on and off in time, with the qubits at fixed positions, as in a quantum network diagram (fig. 8, 12). Other models 6.2 Church-Turing principle of quantum computation can be conceived, such as a cellular automaton model (Margolus 1990). Having presented the QC, it is necessary to argue for its universality, i.e. that it fulfills the Church-Turing Principle as claimed. The two-step argument is very 6.1 Universal gate simple. First, the state of any finite quantum system is simply a vector in Hilbert space, and therefore can be The universal quantum gate is the quantum equivalent represented to arbitrary precision by a finite number of of the classical universal gate, namely a gate which qubits. Secondly, the evolution of any finite quantum 28

system is a unitary transformation of the state, and therefore can be simulated on the QC, which can generate any unitary transformation with arbitrary precision. A point of principle is raised by Myers (1997), who points out that there is a difficulty with computational tasks for which the number of steps for completion cannot be predicted. We cannot in general observe the QC to find out if it has halted, in contrast to a classical computer. However, we will only be concerned with tasks where either the number of steps is predictable, or the QC can signal completion by setting a dedicated qubit which is otherwise not involved in the computation (Deutsch 1985). This is a very broad class of problems. Nielsen and Chuang (1997) consider the use of a fixed quantum gate array, showing that there is no array which, operating on qubits representing both data and program, can perform any unitary transformation on the data. However, we consider a machine in which a classical computer controls the quantum gates applied to a quantum register, so any gate array can be `ordered' by a classical program to the classical computer. The QC is certainly an interesting theoretical tool. However, there hangs over it a large and important question-mark: what about imperfection? The prescription given above is written as if measurements and gates can be applied with arbitrary precision, which is unphysical, as is the fourth requirement (no extraneous evolution). The prescription can be made realistic by attaching to each of the four requirements a statement about the degree of allowable imprecision. This is a subject of on-going research, and we will take it up in section 9. Meanwhile, let us investigate more specifically what a sufficiently well-made quantum computer might do.

highly unlikely that quantum mechanics, or any future physical theory, would permit computational problems to be addressed which are not in principle solvable on a large enough classical Turing machine. However, as we saw in section 3.2, those words `large enough', and also `fast enough', are centrally important in computer science. Problems which are computationally `hard' can be impossible in practice. In technical language, while quantum computing does not enlarge the set of computational problems which can be addressed (compared to classical computing), it does introduce the possibility of new complexity classes. Put more simply, tasks for which classical computers are too slow may be solvable with quantum computers.

Simulation of physical systems

Quantum algorithms

The first and most obvious application of a QC is that of simulating some other quantum system. To simulate a state vector in a 2n -dimensional Hilbert space, a classical computer needs to manipulate vectors containing of order 2n complex numbers, whereas a quantum computer requires just n qubits, making it much more efficient in storage space. To simulate evolution, in general both the classical and quantum computers will be inefficient. A classical computer must manipulate matrices containing of order 22n elements, which requires a number of operations (multiplication, addition) exponentially large in n, while a quantum computer must build unitary operations in 2n -dimensional Hilbert space, which usually requires an exponentially large number of elementary quantum logic gates. Therefore the quantum computer is not guaranteed to simulate every physical system efficiently. However, it can be shown that it can simulate a large class of quantum systems efficiently, including many for which there is no efficient classical algorithm, such as many-body systems with local interactions (Lloyd 1996, Zalka 1996, Wiesner 1996, Meyer 1996, Lidar and Biam 1996, Abrams and Lloyd 1997, Boghosian and Taylor 1997).

It is well known that classical computers are able to calculate the behaviour of quantum systems, so we have 7.2 Period finding and Shor's factorisation algorithm not yet demonstrated that a quantum computer can do anything which a classical computer can not. Indeed, since our theories of physics always involve equations So far we have discussed simulation of Nature, which is which we can write down and manipulate, it seems a rather restricted type of computation. We would like 29

to let the QC loose on more general problems, but it correspondance with the output state |x |f (x) , so the has so far proved hard to find ones on which it performs process is reversible. Now, applying Uf to the state better than classical computers. However, the fact that given in eq. (34), we obtain there exist such problems at all is a profound insight w-1 into physics, and has stimulated much of the recent 1  |x |f (x) (35) interest in the field. w x=0 Currently one of the most important quantum algorithms is that for finding the period of a function. Suppose a function f (x) is periodic with period r, i.e. f (x) = f (x + r). Suppose further that f (x) can be efficiently computed from x, and all we know initially is that N/2 < r < N for some N . Assuming there is no analytic technique to deduce the period of f (x), the best we can do on a classical computer is to calculate f (x) for of order N/2 values of x, and find out when the function repeats itself (for well-behaved functions  only O( N ) values may be needed on average). This is inefficient since the number of operations is exponential in the input size log N (the information required to specify N ). This state is illustrated in fig. 11a. At this point something rather wonderful has taken place: the value of f (x) has been calculated for w = 2n values of x, all in one go! This feature is referred to as quantum parallelism and represents a huge parallelism because of the exponential dependence on n (imagine having 2100 , i.e. a million times Avagadro's number, of classical processors!)

Although the 2n evaluations of f (x) are in some sense `present' in the quantum state in eq. (35), unfortunately we cannot gain direct access to them. For, a measurement (in the computational basis) of the y register, which is the next step in the algorithm, will only reveal one value of f (x)6 . Suppose the value obtained The task can be solved efficiently on a QC by the el- is f (x) = u. The y register state collapses onto |u , egant method shown in fig. 10, due to Shor (1994), and the total state becomes building on Simon (1994). The QC requires 2n qubits, M-1 plus a further 0(n) for workspace, where n = 2 log N  1  |du + jr |u (36) (the notation x means the nearest integer greater M j=0 than x). These are divided into two `registers', each of n qubits. They will be referred to as the x and y where du + jr, for j = 0, 1, 2 . . . M - 1, are all the registers; both are initially prepared in the state |0 values of x for which f (x) = u. In other words the (i.e. all n qubits in states |0 ). Next, the operation H periodicity of f (x) means that the x register remains is applied to each qubit in the x register, making the in a superposition of M  w/r states, at values of x total state separated by the period r. Note that the offset du of 1  w

the set of x values depends on the value u obtained in (34) the measurement of the y register. It now remains to extract the periodicity of the state in the x register. This is done by applying a Fourier transform, and then measuring the state. The discrete Fourier transform employed is the following unitary process: 1 UF T |x =  w
w-1 k=0

where w = 2n . This operation is referred to as a Fourier transform in fig. 10, for reasons that will shortly become apparant. The notation |x means a state such as |0011010 , where 0011010 is the integer x in binary notation. In this context the basis {|0 , |1 } is referred to as the `computational basis.' It is convenient (though not of course necessary) to use this basis when describing the computer.

a simple function. This and all the above ingredients were first brought together by Shor (1994), who thus showed that the factorisation problem is tractable on an ideal quantum computer. The function to be evaluated in this case is f (x) = ax mod N where N is the number to be factorised, and a < N is chosen randomly. One can show using elementary number theory (Ekert and Josza 1996) that for most choices of a, the period r is even and ar/2 ± 1 shares a common factor with N . The common factor (which is of course a factor N ) can then be deduced rapidly using a classical The y register no longer concerns us, so we will just algorithm due to Euclid (circa 300 BC; see, e.g. Hardy and Wright 1965). consider the x state from eq. (36): UF T is based on the fast Fourier transform algorithm (see, e.g., Knuth (1981)). The quantum version was worked out by Coppersmith (1994) and Deutsch (1994) independently, a clear presentation may also be found in Ekert and Josza (1996), Barenco (1996)7 . Before applying UF T to eq. (36) we will make the simplifying assumption that r divides w exactly, so M = w/r. The essential ideas are not affected by this restriction; when it is relaxed some added complications must be taken into account (Shor 1994, 1995a; Ekert and Josza 1996).

This state is illustrated in fig. 11b. The final state of the x register is now measured, and we see that the value obtained must be a multiple of w/r. It remains to deduce r from this. We have x = w/r where  is unknown. If  and r have no common factors, then we cancel x/w down to an irreducible fraction and thus obtain  and r. If  and r have a common factor, which is unlikely for large r, then the algorithm fails. In this case, the whole algorithm must be repeated from the start. After a number of repetitions no greater than  log r, and usually much less than this, the probability of success can be shown to be arbitrarily close to 1 (Ekert and Josza 1996). The quantum period-finding algorithm we have described is efficient as long as Uf , the evaluation of f (x), is efficient. The total number of elementary logic gates required is a polynomial rather than exponential function of n. As was emphasised in section 3.2, this makes all the difference between tractable and intractable in practice, for sufficiently large n.

To evaluate f (x) efficiently, repeated squaring (modulo N ) is used, giving powers ((a2 )2 )2 . . .. Selected such powers of a, corresponding to the binary expansion of a, are then multiplied together. Complete networks for the whole of Shor's algorithm were described by Miquel et. al. (1996), Vedral et. al. (1996) and Beckman et. al. (1996). They require of order 300(log N )3 logic gates. Therefore, to factorise numbers of order 10130 , i.e. at the limit of current classical methods, would require  2 × 1010 gates per run, or 7 hours if the `switching rate' is one megaHertz8 . Considering how difficult it is to make a quantum computer, this offers no advantage over classical computation. However, if we double the number of digits to 260 then the problem is intractable classically (see section 3.2), while the ideal quantum computer takes just 8 times longer than before. The existence of such a powerful method is an exciting and profound new insight into quantum theory.

The period-finding algorithm appears at first sight like a conjuring trick: it is not quite clear how the quantum computer managed to produce the period like a rabbit out of a hat. Examining fig. 11 and equations (34) to (38), I would say that the most important features are contained in eq. (35). They are not only the quantum parallelism already mentioned, but also quantum entanglement, and, finally, quantum interference. Each value of f (x) retains a link with the value of x To add the icing on the cake, it can be remarked that which produced it, through the entanglement of the x the important factorisation problem mentioned in sec- and y registers in eq. (35). The `magic' happens when tion 3.2 can be reduced to one of finding the period of a measurement of the y register produces the special
7 An exact quantum Fourier transform would require rotation operations of precision exponential in n, which raises a problem with the efficiency of Shor's algorithm. However, an approximate version of the Fourier transform is sufficient (Barenco et. al. 1996) 8 The algorithm might need to be run log r  60 times to ensure at least one successful run, but the average number of runs required will be much less than this.

Experimental quantum information processors

some of the important methods but were not experimentally feasible. Further recent proposals (Privman et. al. 1997, Loss and DiVincenzo 1997) may become feasible in the near future.

The most elementary quantum logical operations have been demonstrated in many physics experiments during the past 50 years. For example, the not operation (X) is no more than a stimulated transition between two energy levels |0 and |1 . The important xor operation can also be identified as a driven transition in a four-level system. However, if we wish to contemplate a quantum computer it is necessary to find a system which is sufficiently controllable to allow quantum logic gates to be applied at will, and yet is sufficiently complicated to store many qubits of quantum information. It is very hard to find such systems. One might hope to fabricate quantum devices on solid state microchips-- this is the logical progression of the microfabrication techniques which have allowed classical computers to become so powerful. However, quantum computation relies on complicated interference effects and the great problem in realising it is the problem of noise. No quantum system is really isolated, and the coupling to the environment produces decoherence which destroys the quantum computation. In solid state devices the environment is the substrate, and the coupling to this environment is strong, producing typical decoherence times of the order of picoseconds. It is important to realise that it is not enough to have two different states |0 and |1 which are themselves stable (for example states of different current in a superconductor): we require also that superpositions such as |0 + |1 preserve their phase, and this is typically where the decoherence timescale is so short. At present there are two candidate systems which should permit quantum computation on 10 to 40 qubits. These are the proposal of Cirac and Zoller (1995) using a line of singly charged atoms confined and cooled in vacuum in an ion trap, and the proposal of Gershenfeld and Chuang (1997), and simultaneously Cory et. al. (1996), using the methods of bulk nuclear magnetic resonance. In both cases the proposals rely on the impressive efforts of a large community of researchers which developed the experimental techniques. Previous proposals for experimental quantum computation (Lloyd 1993, Berman et. al. 1994, Barenco et. al. 1995a, DiVincenzo 1995b) touched on

8.1

Ion trap

The ion trap method is illustrated in fig. 12, and described in detail by Steane (1997b). A string of ions is confined by a combination of oscillating and static electric fields in a linear `Paul trap' in high vacuum (10-8 Pa). A single laser beam is split by beam splitters and acousto-optic modulators into many beam pairs, one pair illuminating each ion. Each ion has two long-lived states, for example different levels of the ground state hyperfine structure (the lifetime of such states against spontaneous decay can exceed thousands of years). Let us refer to these two states as |g and |e ; they are orthogonal and so together represent one qubit. Each laser beam pair can drive coherent Raman transitions between the internal states of the relevant ion. This allows any single-qubit quantum gate to be applied to any ion, but not two-qubit gates. The latter requires an interaction between ions, and this is provided by their Coulomb repulsion. However, exactly how to use this interaction is far from obvious; it required the important insight of Cirac and Zoller. Light carries not only energy but also momentum, so whenever a laser beam pair interacts with an ion, it exchanges momentum with the ion. In fact, the mutual repulsion of the ions means that the whole string of ions moves en masse when the motion is quantised (M¨ssbauer effect). The motion of the ion string is o quantised because the ion string is confined in the potential provided by the Paul trap. The quantum states of motion correspond to the different degrees of excitation (`phonons') of the normal modes of vibration of the string. In particular we focus on the ground state of the motion |n = 0 and the lowest excited state |n = 1 of the fundamental mode. To achieve, for example, controlled-Z between ion x and ion y, we start with the motion in the ground state |n = 0 . A pulse of the laser beams on ion x drives the transition |n = 0 |g x  |n = 0 |g x , |n = 0 |e x  |n = 1 |g x , so the ion finishes in the ground state, and the motion finishes in the initial state of the ion: this is a `swap' operation. Next a pulse of the laser beams on ion y

and coherence to permit factorisation of hundred-digit numbers. However, it would be fascinating to try a quantum algorithm on just a few qubits (4 to 10) and thus to observe the principles of quantum information processing at work. We will discuss in section 9 methods which should allow the number of coherent gate operations to be greatly increased.

Finally, we repeat the initial pulse on ion x. The overall effect of the three pulses is |n = 0 |g

which is exactly a controlled-Z between x and y. Each laser pulse must have a precisely controlled frequency and duration. The controlled-Z gate and the singlequbit gates together provide a universal set, so we can perform arbitrary transformations of the joint state of all the ions! To complete the prescription for a quantum computer (section 6), we must be able to prepare the initial state and measure the final state. The first is possible through the methods of optical pumping and laser cooling, the second through the `quantum jump' or `electron shelving' measurement technique. All these are powerful techniques developed in the atomic physics community over the past twenty years. However, the combination of all the techniques at once has only been achieved in a single experiment, which demonstrated preparation, quantum gates, and measurement for just a single trapped ion (Monroe et. al 1995b). The chief experimental difficulty in the ion trap method is to cool the string of ions to the ground state of the trap (a sub-microKelvin temperature), and the chief source of decoherence is the heating of this motion owing to the coupling between the charged ion string and noise voltages in the electrodes (Steane 1997, Wineland et. al. 1997). It is unknown just how much the heating can be reduced. A conservative statement is that in the next few years 100 quantum gates could be applied to a few ions without losing coherence. In the longer term one may hope for an order of magnitude increase in both figures. It seems clear that an ion trap processor will never achieve sufficient storage capacity

The proposal using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is illustrated in fig. 13. The quantum processor in this case is a molecule containing a `backbone' of about ten atoms, with other atoms such as hydrogen attached so as to use up all the chemical bonds. It is the nuclei which interest us. Each has a magnetic moment associated with the nuclear spin, and the spin states provide the qubits. The molecule is placed in a large magnetic field, and the spin states of the nuclei are manipulated by applying oscillating magnetic fields in pulses of controlled duration. So far, so good. The problem is that the spin state of the nuclei of a single molecule can be neither prepared nor measured. To circumvent this problem, we use not a single molecule, but a cup of liquid containing some 1020 molecules! We then measure the average spin state, which can be achieved since the average oscillating magnetic moment of all the nuclei is large enough to produce a detectable magnetic field. Some subtleties enter at this point. Each of the molecules in the liquid has a very slightly different local magnetic field, influenced by other molecules in the vicinity, so each `quantum processor' evolves slightly differently. This problem is circumvented by the spin-echo technique, a standard tool in NMR which allows the effects of free evolution of the spins to be reversed, without reversing the effect of the quantum gates. However, this increases the difficulty of applying long sequences of quantum gates. The remaining problem is to prepare the initial state. The cup of liquid is in thermal equilibrium to begin with, so the different spin states have occupation probabilities given by the Boltzman distribution. One makes use of the fact that spin states are close in energy, and so have nearly equal occupations initially. Thus the density matrix  of the O(1020 ) nuclear spins

is very close to the identity matrix I. It is the small difference  =  - I which can be used to store quantum information. Although  is not the density matrix of any quantum system, it nevertheless transforms under well-chosen field pulses in the same way as a density matrix would, and hence can be considered to represent an effective quantum computer. The reader is referred to Gershenfeld and Chuang (1997) for a detailed description, including the further subtlety that an effective pure state must be distilled out of  by means of a pulse sequence which performs quantum data compression.

Quantum error correction

In section 7 we discussed some beautiful quantum algorithms. Their power only rivals classical computers, however, on quite large problems, requiring thousands of qubits and billions of quantum gates (with the possible exception of algorithms for simulation of physical systems). In section 8 we examined some experimental systems, and found that we can only contemplate `computers' of a few tens of qubits and perhaps some thousands of gates. Such systems are not `computers' at all because they are not sufficiently versatile: they NMR experiments have for some years routinely should at best be called modest quantum information achieved spin state manipulations and measurements processors.

This coupling can be used to apply quantum 106 than to achieve such low decoherence in a large gates between the field mode and the ion, thus opening quantum computer. Such arguments were eloquently the way to transferring quantum information between put forward by Haroche and Raimond (1996). Their separated ion traps, via high-Q optical cavities and op- work, and that of others such as Landauer (1995,1996) tical fibres (Cirac et. al. 1997). Such experiments are sounds a helpful note of caution. More detailed treatnow being contemplated. The required strong coupling ments of decoherence in quantum computers are given between a cavity field and an atom has been demon- by Unruh (1995), Palma et. al. (1996) and Chuang et. strated by Brune et. al. (1994), and Turchette et. al. al. (1995). Large numerical studies are described by (1995). An electromagnetic field mode can also be used Miquel et. al. (1996) and Barenco et. al. (1997). to couple ions within a single trap, providing a faster alternative to the phonon method (Pellizzari et. al. Classical computers are reliable not because they are perfectly engineered, but because they are insensitive 1995). to noise. One way to understand this is to examine in detail a device such as a flip-flop, or even a humble 36

mechanical switch. Their stability is based on a combination of amplification and dissipation: a small departure of a mechanical switch from `on' or `off' results in a large restoring force from the spring. Amplifiers do the corresponding job in a flip-flop. The restoring force is not sufficient alone, however: with a conservative force, the switch would oscillate between `on' and `off'. It is important also to have damping, supplied by an inelastic collision which generates heat in the case of a mechanical switch, and by resistors in the electronic flip-flop. However, these methods are ruled out for a quantum computer by the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. The no-cloning theorem means amplification of unknown quantum states is impossible, and dissipation is incompatible with unitary evolution. Such fundamental considerations lead to the widely accepted belief that quantum mechanics rules out the possibility to stabilize a quantum computer against the effects of random noise. A repeated projection of the computer's state by well-chosen measurements is not in itself sufficient (Berthiaume et. al. 1994, Miquel et. al 1997). However, by careful application of information theory one can find a way around this impasse. The idea is to adapt the error correction methods of classical information theory to the quantum situation. Quantum error correction (QEC) was established as an important and general method by Steane (1996b) and independently Calderbank and Shor (1996). Some of the ideas had been introduced previously by Shor (1995b) and Steane (1996a). They are related to the `entanglement purification' introduced by Bennett et. al. (1996a) and independently Deutsch et. al. (1996). The theory of QEC was further advanced by Knill and Laflamme (1997), Ekert and Macchiavello (1996), Bennett et. al. (1996b). The latter paper describes the optimal 5-qubit code also independently discovered by Laflamme et. al. (1996). Gottesman (1996) and Calderbank et. al. (1997) discovered a general group-theoretic framework, introducing the important concept of the stabilizer, which also enabled many more codes to be found (Calderbank et. al. 1996, Steane 1996cd). Quantum coding theory reached a further level of maturity with the discovery by Shor and Laflamme (1997) of a quantum analogue to the MacWilliams identities of classical coding theory.

QEC uses networks of quantum gates and measurements, and at first is was not clear whether these networks had themselves to be perfect in order for the method to work. An important step forward was taken by Shor (1996) and Kitaev (1996) who showed how to make error correcting networks tolerant of errors within the network. In other words, such `fault tolerant' networks remove more noise than they introduce. Shor's methods were generalised by DiVincenzo and Shor (1996) and made more efficient by Steane (1997a,c). Knill and Laflamme (1996) introduced the idea of `concatenated' coding, which is a recursive coding method. It has the advantage of allowing arbitrarily long quantum computations as long as the noise per elementary operation is below a finite threshold, at the cost of inefficient use of quantum memory (so requiring a large computer). This threshold result was derived by several authors (Knill et al 1996, Aharonov and Ben-Or 1996, Gottesman et. al. 1996). Further fault tolerant methods are described by Knill et. al. (1997), Gottesman (1997), Kitaev (1997). The discovery of QEC was roughly simultaneous with that of a related idea which also permits noise-free transmission of quantum states over a noisy quantum channel. This is the `entanglement purification' (Bennett et. al. 1996a, Deutsch et. al. 1996). The central idea here is for Alice to generate many entangled pairs of qubits, sending one of each pair down the noisy channel to Bob. Bob and Alice store their qubits, and perform simple parity checking measurements: for example, Bob's performs xor between a given qubit and the next he receives, then measures just the target qubit. Alice does the same on her qubits, and they compare results. If they agree, the unmeasured qubits are (by chance) closer than average to the desired state |00 + |11 . If they disagree, the qubits are rejected. By recursive use of such checks, a few `good' entangled pairs are distilled out of the many noisy ones. Once in possession of a good entangled state, Alice and Bob can communicate by teleportation. A thorough discussion is given by Bennett et. al. (1996b). Using similar ideas, with important improvements, van Enk et. al. (1997) have recently shown how quantum information might be reliably transmitted between atoms in separated high-Q optical cavities via imperfect optical fibres, using imperfect gate operations.

I will now outline the main principles of QEC. Let us write down the worst possible thing which could happen to a single qubit: a completely general interaction between a qubit and its environment is |ei (a |0 + b |1 )  a (c00 |e00 |0 + c01 |e01 |1 ) + b (c10 |e10 |1 + c11 |e11 |0 )

(44) only contains Ms  S, then the joint state of environment, qc and a after syndrome extraction is
s

|es (Ms |E ) |s

a

(45)

(42)

where |e... denotes states of the environment and c... are coefficients depending on the noise. The first significant point is to notice that this general interaction can be written |ei |  (|eI I + |eX X + |eY Y + |eZ Z) | (43)

where | = a |0 + b |1 is the initial state of the qubit, and |eI = c00 |e00 + c10 |e10 , |eX = c01 |e01 + c11 |e11 , and so on. Note that these environment states are not necessarily normalised. Eq. (43) tells us that The only assumption in the above was that the noise in we have essentially three types of error to correct on eq. (44) only contains error operators in the correctable each qubit: X, Y and Z errors. These are `bit flip' (X) set S. In practice, the noise includes both members and errors, phase errors (Z) or both (Y = XZ). non-members of S, and the important quantity is the probability that the state collapses onto a correctable Suppose our computer q is to manipulate k qubits of one when the syndrome is extracted. It is here that the quantum information. Let a general state of the k theory of error-correcting codes enters in: our task is to qubits be | . We first make the computer larger, infind encoding and extraction operations E, A such that troducing a further n - k qubits, initially in the state the set S of correctable errors includes all the errors |0 . Call the enlarged system qc. An `encoding' opermost likely to occur. This is a very difficult problem. ation is performed: E(| |0 ) = |E . Now, let noise affect the n qubits of qc. Without loss of generality, It is a general truth that to permit efficient stabilizathe noise can be written as a sum of `error operators' tion against noise, we have to know something about M , where each error operator is a tensor product of the noise we wish to suppress. The most obvious quasin operators (one for each qubit), taken from the set realistic assumption is that of uncorrelated stochastic {I, X, Y, Z}. For example M = I1 X2 I3 Y4 Z5 X6 I7 for noise. That is, at a given time or place the noise might the case n = 7. A general noisy state is have any effect, but the effects on different qubits, or on the same qubit at different times, are uncorrelated. |es Ms |E (44) This is the quantum equivalent of the binary symets ric channel, section 2.3. By assuming uncorrelated Now we introduce even more qubits: a further n - k, stochastic noise we can place all possible error operprepared in the state |0 a . This additional set is ators M in a heirarchy of probability: those affecting called an `ancilla'. For any given encoding E, there few qubits (i.e. only a few terms in the tensor product exists a syndrome extraction operation A, operating are different from I) are most likely, while those afon the joint system of qc and a. whose effect is fecting many qubits at once are unlikely. Our aim will A(Ms |E |0 a ) = (Ms |E ) |s a  Ms  S. The set S be to find quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) is the set of correctable errors, which depends on the such that all errors affecting up to t qubits will be corencoding. In the notation |s a , s is just a binary num- rectable. Such a QECC is termed a `t-error correcting ber which indicates which error operator Ms we are code'. dealing with, so the states |s a are mutually orthogonal. Suppose for simplicity that the general noisy state The simplest code construction (that discovered by 38

We now measure the ancilla state, and something rather wonderful happens: the whole state collapses onto |es (Ms |E ) |s a , for some particular value of s. Now, instead of general noise, we have just one particular error operator Ms to worry about. Furthermore, the measurement tells us the value s (the `error syndrome') from which we can deduce which Ms we have! -1 Armed with this knowledge, we apply Ms to qc by means of a few quantum gates (X, Z or Y ), thus producing the final state |es |E |s a . In other words, we have recovered the noise-free state of qc! The final environment state is immaterial, and we can re-prepare the ancilla in |0 a for further use.

Calderbank and Shor and Steane) goes as follows. First we notice that a classical error correcting code, such as the Hamming code shown in table 1, can be used to correct X errors. The proof relies on eq. (17) which permits the syndrome extraction A to produce an ancilla state |s which depends only on the error Ms and not on the computer's state | . This suggests that we store k quantum bits by means of the 2k mutually orthogonal n-qubit states |i , where the binary number i is a member of a classical error correcting code C, see section 2.4. This will not allow correction of Z errors, however. Observe that since Z = HXH, the correction of Z errors is equivalent to rotating the state of each qubit by H, correcting X errors, and rotating back again. This rotation is called a Hadamard transform; it is just a change in basis. The next ingredient is to notice the following special property (Steane 1996a): ~ H 1 |i =  2k iC |j (46)

perturbation you introduced did nothing at all to the stored quantum information! More powerful QECCs can be obtained from more powerful classical codes, and there exist quantum code constructions more efficient than the one just outlined. Suppose we store k qubits into n. There are 3n ways for a single qubit to be in error, since the error might be one of X, Y or Z. The number of syndrome bits is n - k, so if every single-qubit error, and the errorfree case, is to have a different syndrome, we require 2n-k  3n + 1. For k = 1 this lower limit is filled exactly by n = 5 and indeed such a 5-qubit single-error correcting code exists (Laflamme et. al. 1996, Bennett et. al. 1996b). More generally, the remarkable fact is that for fixed k/n, codes exist for which t/n is bounded from below as n   (Calderbank and Shor 1995, Steane 1996b, Calderbank et. al. 1997). This leads to a quantum version of Shannon's theorem (section 2.4), though an exact definition of the capacity of a quantum channel remains unclear (Schumacher and Nielsen 1996, Barnum et. al. 1996, Lloyd 1997, Bennett et. al. 1996b, Knill and Laflamme 1997a). For finite n, the probability that the noise produces uncorrectable errors scales roughly as (n)t+1 , where   1 is the probability of an arbitrary error on each qubit. This represents an extremely powerful noise suppression. We need to be able to reduce  to a sufficiently small value by passive means, and then QEC does the rest. For example, consider the case   0.001. With n = 23 there exisits a code correcting all t = 3-qubit errors (Golay 1949, Steane 1996c). The probability that uncorrectable noise occurs is  0.0234  3 × 10-7 , thus the noise is suppressed by more than three orders of magnitude.

jC 

~ where H  H1 H2 H3 · · · Hn . In words, this says that if we make a quantum state by superposing all the members of a classical error correcting code C, then the Hadamard-transformed state is just a superposition of all the members of the dual code C  . From this it follows, after some further steps, that it is possible to correct both X and Z errors (and therefore also Y errors) if we use quantum states of the form given in eq. (46), as long as both C and C  are good classical error correcting codes, i.e. both have good correction abilities. The simplest QECC constructed by the above recipe requires n = 7 qubits to store a single (k = 1) qubit of useful quantum information. The two orthogonal states required to store the information are built from the Hamming code shown in table 1:

So far I have described QEC as if the ancilla and the |0E  |0000000 + |1010101 + |0110011 + |1100110 many quantum gates and measurements involved were + |0001111 + |1011010 + |0111100 + |1101001 (47) themselves noise-free.

Shor (1996) and Kitaev (1996) discovered ways in which all Such a QECC has the following remarkable property. the required operations can be arranged so that the corImagine I store a general (unknown) state of a single rection suppresses more noise than it introduces. The qubit into a spin state a |0E + b |1E of 7 spin-half essential ideas are to verify states wherever possible, particles. I then allow you to do anything at all to to restrict the propagation of errors by careful network any one of the 7 spins. I could nevertheless extract design, and to repeat the syndrome extraction: for each my original qubit state exactly. Therefore the large 39

group of qubits qc, the syndrome is extracted several times and qc is only corrected once t + 1 mutually consistent syndromes are obtained. Fig. 14 illustrates a fault-tolerant syndrome extraction network, i.e. one which restricts the propagation of errors. Note that a is verified before it is used, and each qubit in qc only interacts with one qubit in a. In fault-tolerant computing, we cannot apply arbitrary rotations of a logical qubit, eq. (33), in a single step. However, particular rotations through irrational angles can be carried out, and thus general rotations are generated to an arbitrary degree of precision through repetition. Note that the set of computational gates is now discrete rather than continuous. Recently the requirements for reliable quantum computing using fault-tolerant QEC have been estimated (Preskill 1997, Steane 1997c). They are formidable. For example, a computation beyond the capabilities of the best classical computers might require 1000 qubits and 1010 quantum gates. Without QEC, this would require a noise level of order 10-13 per qubit per gate, which we can rule out as impossible. With QEC, the computer would have to be made ten or perhaps one hundred times larger, and many thousands of gates would be involved in the correctors for each elementary step in the computation. However, much more noise could be tolerated: up to about 10-5 per qubit per gate (i.e. in any of the gates, including those in the correctors) (Steane 1997c). This is daunting but possible. The error correction methods briefly described here are not the only type possible. If we know more about the noise, then humbler methods requiring just a few qubits can be quite powerful. Such a method was proposed by Cirac et. al. (1996) to deal with the principle noise source in an ion trap, which is changes of the motional state during gate operations. Also, some joint states of several qubits can have reduced noise if the environment affects all qubits together. For example the two states |01 ± |10 are unchanged by environmental coupling of the form |e0 I1 I2 + |e1 X1 X2 . (Palma et. al. 1996, Chuang and Yamamoto 1997). Such states offer a calm eye within the storm of decoherence, in which quantum information can be manipulated with relative impunity. A practical computer would probably use a combination of methods.

Discussion

The idea of `Quantum Computing' has fired many imaginations simply because the words themselves suggest something strange but powerful, as if the physicists have come up with a second revolution in information processing to herald the next millenium. This is a false impression. Quantum computing will not replace classical computing for similar reasons that quantum physics does not replace classical physics: no one ever consulted Heisenberg in order to design a house, and no one takes their car to be mended by a quantum mechanic. If large quantum computers are ever made, they will be used to address just those special tasks which benefit from quantum information processing. A more lasting reason to be excited about quantum computing is that it is a new and insightful way to think about the fundamental laws of physics. The quantum computing community remains fairly small at present, yet the pace of progress has been fast and accelerating in the last few years. The ideas of classical information theory seem to fit into quantum mechanics like a hand into a glove, giving us the feeling that we are uncovering something profound about Nature. Shannon's noiseless coding theorem leads to Schumacher and Josza's quantum coding theorem and the significance of the qubit as a useful measure of information. This enables us to keep track of quantum information, and to be confident that it is independent of the details of the system in which it is stored. This is necessary to underpin other concepts such as error correction and computing. The classical theory of error correction leads to the discovery of quantum error correction. This allows a physical process previously thought to be impossible, namely the almost perfect recovery of a general quantum state, undoing even irreversible processes such as relaxation by spontaneous emission. For example, during a long errorcorrected quantum computation, using fault-tolerant methods, every qubit in the computer might decay a million times and yet the coherence of the quantum information be preserved. Hilbert's questions regarding the logical structure of mathematics encourage us to ask a new type of question about the laws of physics. In looking at Schr¨dinger's equation, we can neglect whether it is o describing an electron or a planet, and just ask about

40

the state manipulations it permits. The language of information and computer science enables us to frame such questions. Even such a simple idea as the quantum gate, the cousin of the classical binary logic gate, turns out to be very useful, because it enables us to think clearly about quantum state manipulations which would otherwise seem extremely complicated or impractical. Such ideas open the way to the design of quantum algorithms such as those of Shor, Grover and Kitaev. These show that quantum mechanics allows information processing of a kind ruled out in classical physics. It relies on the propagation of a quantum state through a huge (exponentially large) number of dimensions of Hilbert space. The computation result arises from a controlled interference among many computational paths, which even after we have examined the mathematical description, still seems wonderful and surprising. The intrinsic difficulty of quantum computation lies in the sensitivity of large-scale interference to noise and imprecision. A point often raised against the quantum computer is that it is essentially an analogue rather than a digital device, and has many limitations as a result. This is a misconception. It is true that any quantum system has a continuous state space, but so has any classical system, including the circuits of a digital computer. The fault-tolerant methods used to permit error correction in a quantum computer restrict the set of quantum gates to a discrete set, therefore the `legal' states of the quantum computer are discrete, just as in a classical digital computer. The really important difference between analogue and digital computing is that to increase the precision of a result arrived at by analogue means, one must re-engineer the whole computer, whereas with digital methods one need merely increase the number of bits and operations. The faulttolerant quantum computer has more in common with a digital than an analogue device. Shor's algorithm for the factorisation problem stimulated a lot of interest in part because of the connection with data encryption. However, I feel that the significance of Shor's algorithm is not primarily in its possible use for factoring large integers in the distant future. Rather, it has acted as a stimulus to the field, proving the existence of a powerful new type of computing made possible by controlled quantum evolution, and exhibiting some of the new methods. At present, the

most practically significant achievement in the general area of quantum information physics is not in computing at all, but in quantum key distribution. The title `quantum computer' will remain a misnomer for any experimental device realised in the next twenty years. It is an abuse of language to call even a pocket calculator a `computer', because the word has come to be reserved for general-purpose machines which more or less realise Turing's concept of the Universal Machine. The same ought to be true for quantum computers if we do not want to mislead people. However, small quantum information processors may serve useful roles. For example, concepts learned from quantum information theory may permit the discovery of useful new spectroscopic methods in nuclear magnetic resonance. Quantum key distribution could be made more secure, and made possible over larger distances, if small `relay stations' could be built which applied purification or error correction methods. The relay station could be an ion trap combined with a high-Q cavity, which is realisable with current technology. It will surely not be long before a quantum state is teleported from one laboratory to another, a very exciting prospect. The great intrinsic value of a large quantum computer is offset by the difficulty of making one. However, few would argue that this prize does not at least merit a lot of effort to find out just how unattainable, or hopefully attainable, it is. One of the chief uses of a processor which could manipulate a few quantum bits may be to help us better understand decoherence in quantum mechanics. This will be amenable to experimental investigation during the next few years: rather than waiting in hope, there is useful work to be done now. On the theoretical side, there are two major open questions: the nature of quantum algorithms, and the limits on reliability of quantum computing. It is not yet clear what is the essential nature of quantum computing, and what general class of computational problem is amenable to efficient solution by quantum methods. Is there a whole mine of useful quantum algorithms waiting to be delved, or will the supply dry up with the few nuggets we have so far discovered? Can significant computational power be achieved with less than 100 qubits? This is by no means ruled out, since it is hard to simulate even 20 qubits by classical means. Concerning reliability, great progress has been made, so that we

41

can now be cautiously optimistic that quantum computing is not an impossible dream. We can identify requirements sufficient to guarantee reliable computing, involving for example uncorrelated stochastic noise of order 10-5 per gate, and a quantum computer a hundred times larger than the logical machine embedded within it. However, can quantum decoherence be relied upon to have the properties assumed in such an estimate, and if not then can error correction methods still be found? Conversely, once we know more about the noise, it may be possible to identify considerably less taxing requirements for reliable computing. To conclude with, I would like to propose a more wideranging theoretical task: to arrive at a set of principles like energy and momentum conservation, but which apply to information, and from which much of quantum mechanics could be derived. Two tests of such ideas would be whether the EPR-Bell correlations thus became transparent, and whether they rendered obvious the proper use of terms such as `measurement' and `knowledge'. I hope that quantum information physics will be recognised as a valuable part of fundamental physics. The quest to bring together Turing machines, information, number theory and quantum physics is for me, and I hope will be for readers of this review, one of the most fascinating cultural endeavours one could have the good fortune to encounter. I thank the Royal Society and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, for their support.

Fig. 1. Maxwell's demon. In this illustration the demon sets up a pressure difference by only raising the partition when more gas molecules approach it from the left than from the right. This can be done in a completely reversible manner, as long as the demon's memory stores the random results of its observations of the molecules. The demon's memory thus gets hotter. The irreversible step is not the acquisition of information, but the loss of information if the demon later clears its memory.

Fig. 5. Illustration of Shannon's theorem. Alice sends n = 100 bits over a noisy channel, in order to communicate k bits of information to Bob. The figure shows the probability that Bob interprets the received data correctly, as a function of k/n, when the error probability per bit is p = 0.25. The channel capacity is C = 1-H(0.25)  0.19. Dashed line: Alice sends each bit repeated n/k times. Full line: Alice uses the best linear error-correcting code of rate k/n. The dotted line gives the performance of error-correcting codes with larger n, to illustrate Shannon's theorem.

Fig. 7. The Turing Machine. This is a conceptual mechanical device which can be shown to be capable of efficiently simulating all classical computational methods. The machine has a finite set of internal states, and a fixed design. It reads one binary symbol at a time, supplied on a tape. The machine's action on reading a given symbol s depends only on that symbol and the internal state G. The action consists in overwriting a new symbol s on the current tape location, changing state to G , and moving the tape one place in direction d (left or right). The internal construction of the machine can therefore be specified by a finite fixed list of rules of the form (s, G  s , G , d). One special internal state is the `halt' state: once in this state the machine ceases further activity. An input `programme' on the tape is transformed by the machine into an output result printed on the tape.

Fig. 12. Ion trap quantum information processor. A string of singly-charged atoms is stored in a linear ion trap. The ions are separated by  20 µm by their mutual repulsion. Each ion is addressed by a pair of laser beams which coherently drive both Raman transitions in the ions, and also transitions in the state of motion of the string. The motional degree of freedom serves as a single-qubit `bus' to transport quantum information among the ions. State preparation is by optical pumping and laser cooling; readout is by electron shelving and resonance fluorescence, which enables the state of each ion to be measured with high signal to noise ratio.

Fig. 13. Bulk nuclear spin resonance quantum information processor. A liquid of  1020 `designer' molecules is placed in a sensitive magnetometer, which can both generate oscillating magnetic fields and also detect the precession of the mean magnetic moment of the liquid. The situation is somewhat like having 1020 independent processors, but the initial state is one of thermal equilibrium, and only the average final state can be detected. The quantum information is stored and manipulated in the nuclear spin states. The spin state energy levels of a given nucleus are influenced by neighbouring nuclei in the molecule, which enables xor gates to be applied. They are little influenced by anything else, owing to the small size of a nuclear magnetic moment, which means the inevitable dephasing of the processors with respect to each other is relatively slow. This dephasing can be undone by `spin echo' methods.

Fig. 14. Fault tolerant syndrome extraction, for the QECC given in equations (47),(48). The upper 7 qubits are qc, the lower are the ancilla a. All gates, measurements and free evolution are assumed to be noisy. Only H and 2-qubit xor gates are used; when several xors have the same control or target bit they are shown superimposed, NB this is a non-standard notation. The first part of the network, up until the 7 H gates, prepares a in |0E , and also verifies a: a small box represents a single-qubit measurement. If any measurement gives 1, the preparation is restarted. The H gates transform the state of a to |0E + |1E . Finally, the 7 xor gates between qc and a carry out a single xor in the encoded basis {|0E , |1E }. This operation carries X errors from qc into a, and Z errors from a into qc. The X errors in qc can be deduced from the result of measuring a. A further network is needed to identify Z errors. Such correction never makes qc completely noise-free, but when applied between computational steps it reduces the accumulation of errors to an acceptable level.

General principles and experimental schemes for generating a desired few-photon state from an aggregate of squeezed atoms are presented. Quantum-statistical information of the collective atomic dipole is found to be faithfully transferred to the photon state even in a few-photon regime. The controllability of few-photon states is shown to increase with increasing the number of squeezed atoms. 42.50.Dv, 03.65.Bz, 42.50.Gy, 42.50.Lc

^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Sy = i iy /2, and Sz = i iz /2, where ix , iy , and iz denote the Pauli spin operators for the ith atom. ^ Assuming the Jaynes-Cummings interaction [5] between the atoms and the photon field, the total Hamiltonian is given by ^ ¯ ^ ¯ ^ ^ ¯ a^ ^ ^ H = ha Sz + hf a a + hg(^S+ + a S- ), (1)

One of the main aims in quantum optics has been to manipulate quantum-statistical properties of the electromagnetic field. Since the first milestone of generating squeezed state of light was successfully achieved [1], considerable efforts have been devoted towards the production of number state whose average photon number is less than a few tens [2,3]. If the average photon number is much greater than this, the necessity of using nonclassical light virtually disappears because the coherent state having a few tens of photons already has a sufficiently low bit error rate required for optical communication and precision measurement. Photons also carry information about the phase whose quantum fluctuations limit the interferometric sensitivity [4]. In contrast to the case of photon number, methods of regulating the phase of few-photon states have yet to be explored. In this Letter we, for the first time, present general principles and experimental schemes for generating a desired few-photon state. By this method one can control not only the average and variance in photon number, but also the width and orientation of the uncertainty ellipse in phase space in any desired direction. We will show that quantum-statistical information of the collective atom dipole is rather faithfully transferred to those of emitted photons, and discuss how to exploit this property to produce a desired few-photon state. We can thus generate any desired fewphoton state by preparing the atoms in some prescribed quantum state. We first discuss a general condition for a collection of atoms to be able to generate any desired few-photon state. Consider a simple situation in which a collection of atoms are placed in a resonant cavity and interact with a single-mode photon field. It is well-known that collective properties of two-level atoms, which are placed within the photon wavelength but not too close to avoid direct interaction between the atoms, can be described in ^ ^ terms of the collective spin operators as Sx = i ix /2,

where a and a are the creation and annihilation opera^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ¯ tors of the photon field, S±  Sx ± iSy , ha is the energy difference between the two levels of the atoms, ¯ f h is an energy quantum of the photon, and g is a coupling constant. When f = a , we can eliminate the noninteracting part of the Hamiltonian H0 = ha Sz + hf a a by ¯ ^ ¯ ^ ^ ^ 0 t/¯ working on a rotating frame eiH h | . Since we want to manipulate the width and the orientation of the uncertainty ellipse in phase space in any desired direction, it is convenient to introduce operators in the direction spec1 ified by the azimuth angle  as a  2 (^e-i + a ei ) ^ a ^ ^  1 (S+ e-i + S- ei ). These operators obey the ^ ^ and S 2 following equations of motion: d^ a ^ = -g S-+/2 , dt ^ dS-+/2 = -2g^Sz , a ^ dt ^ dSz ^ ^ = 2g(^ S-+/2 + a+/2 S- ). a ^ dt (2) (3) (4)

When the atoms are irradiated by coherent light with classical intensity, the mean field approximation is valid, and Eqs. (2)-(4) reduce to the familiar optical Bloch equations. Since we are interested in reducing quantum fluctuations in a few-photon regime, we have to take into account higher-order correlations. In particular, we are interested in the variance of a . Its dynamical evolution ^ is governed by d (^ )2 a ^ = -2g (^ )(S-+/2 ) , a dt d2 (^ )2 a a a ^ = g 2 4 (^ )(^ Sz ) dt2 ^ +2 (S-+/2 )2 , (5)

In this case, the fluctuations in a will be suppressed to ^ below the standard quantum limit at times much shorter than  g -1 . The field displacement a and its variance ^ (^ )2 can be controlled independently because their a ^ time evolutions are governed respectively by S-+/2 2 ^ and (S-+/2 ) . From Eqs. (2)-(6) we find that the amplitude squeezed state is obtained from the atomic ^ ^ ^ state that satisfies, e.g., Sx = 0, Sy = 0, Sz < 0, ^ ^ and (Sy )2 < | Sz |/2. The phase squeezed state ^ ^ is obtained only by replacing (Sy )2 for (Sx )2 . The right figures in Fig. 1 (a) and (b) illustrate generation of the amplitude squeezed state and the phase squeezed state from squeezed fifty atoms. The left figures show the initial squeezed atom states, prepared by the scheme discussed below, in the spin quasi-probability distribution defined by , |^atom |,  , where |,    ^ ^ e-iSz e-iSy |S, Sz = S is the coherent state of spin or angular momentum and will be referred to as the Bloch state [6]. The quasi-probability distribution of the photon field Q()  Tratom [ |^| ]/ (right figures in Fig. 1  (a) and (b)) is obtained by numerical diagonalization of the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, where | is the coherent state of the radiation field with amplitude , and  is the density operator of the entire system when the ^ maximal squeezing is obtained. From Fig. 1 we find that the profile of Q() follows that of , |^atom |,  pro jected on the Sx -Sy plane, where Sx and Sy correspond to -Im  and -Re . This rather faithful transfer of quantum information from the atomic system to the photon system holds in general, and tells us how to prepare the collective atomic state in order to produce a desired fewphoton state. Figure 1(c) shows the time evolutions of the atomic and field observables for the case of Fig. 1(b). The radiation-field amplitude a grows as the mean spin ^ vector tilts towards the negative z-axis (i.e.,   0). We also note that quantum fluctuations in the radiation field, (^2 )2 decreases in time at the expense of increasing a ^ atomic fluctuations (Sx )2 . For a collection of atoms to be able to radiate a photon state that is squeezed in any desired direction in phase space, which we will refer to as tailor-made radiation, condition (7) has to be met for arbitrary . Thus the necessary and sufficient condition for the tailor-made radiation is given by ^min (S )2 < ^ |S | , 2 (8)

(8) reduces to the criterion obtained in Refs. [4,7] which discussed the interferometric phase sensitivity. A crucial observation is that phase squeezing (as in Fig. 1 (b)) can only be obtained by states satisfying the condition (8). This is because fluctuations projected on the Sx -Sy plane ^min cannot be reduced to below (S )2 in the direction of  by any rotation of the spin vector. This is why the Bloch state which has an isotropic uncertainty distribution with respect to the plane perpendicular to the mean spin vector cannot radiate the phase squeezed state. The

Hiroki Saito and Masahito Ueda Bloch state can, on the other hand, radiate amplitudesqueezed state by tilting the spin vector [8]. Nor can a single atom be used for the tailor-made radiation, because it has no partner to be quantum-mechanically entangled with in order to meet condition (8). It should also be noted that a popular definition of the spin squeezing [8­11] ^ (Si )2 < ^ | Sz | (i = x or y), 2 (9)

cannot be used as a criterion for the tailor-made radiation because this condition can be met by the Bloch state whose spin vector is tilted from the z axis [12]. In order to control the degree of squeezing of photons, we must solve the time evolution (2)-(6). Although the exact solutions is unavailable because of high nonlinearity of these equations, we can obtain approximate solution that becomes exact when the number of atoms is large ^ and Sz  -S, i.e., the spin angle from the negative z-axis is small: (^ )2 = a 1 cos2 2S0 gt 4 ^ (S-+/2 )2 0 sin2 2S0 gt + 2S0 ^ = (S-+/2 )2 0 cos2 2S0 gt S0 + sin2 2S0 gt 2

These so lutions are periodic functions with period (g 2S0 )-1 . The photon fluctuation (10) attains a minimum value  ^ (S-+/2 )2 0 /(2S0 ) at t = (2g 2S0 )-1 , and therefore the squeezed radiation can be obtained if the spin satisfies the condition (7) and the degree of squeezing is proportional to that of the spin. The expressions (10) and (11) imply that quantum fluctuation is transferred from the field to the atoms, as can be seen in Fig. 1(c). Several methods have been proposed to generate squeezed spin state: the Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the coherent state [13], or with the squeezed vacuum [7], and interaction of the spins through nonlinear Hamiltonians [11,4]. We focus our discussion to the first method. In Ref. [13] the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (1) with the initial coherent state and the initial spin state |S, S are used, while in Ref. [7] the interaction ^ Hamiltonian H2 = h(^ S+ + aS- ) with the initial spin ¯ a ^ ^^ state |S, -S are used, where  is a coupling constant. Since these models are mathematically equivalent [14], we restrict our attention to the former. The quantity of our interest is the degree of squeezing of the spin obtained by the interaction with the coherent state, given the number of atoms. We seek the maximally

We propose two possible experimental schemes to implement our theory. The first one is a scheme using the micromaser technique [15] as illustrated in Fig. 3, where the state of atoms is indicated in the spin quasiprobability distribution at each stage. It consists of three stages: (1) The excited two-level atoms are injected into the first cavity in which the atoms become squeezed by interacting with the coherent state of the radiation field | prepared by laser or maser [13]. (2) The output squeezed atoms pass through the coherent field with classical intensity. This field rotates the mean spin vector in the spin space to the desired direction. To control the rotation axis the coherent field and the classical field must be driven synchronously with an appropriate phase difference provided by the phase shifter. (3) The atoms go into the third vacuum cavity, radiate photons and come out of the cavity before reabsorbing the emitted photons. Left in the third cavity is the desired photon state which we can take out by switching the Q-factor of the cavity mechanically or by applying a magnetic field.

4 In conclusion, we have shown that the quantumstatistical information of collective atomic dipoles is faithfully transferred to the radiation field even in a fewphoton regime. This implies that we can produce a desired few-photon state by preparing atoms in an appropriate squeezed state. This idea can be tested using a high-Q cavity that sustains more than one atom undergoing the Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the radiation field.

FIG. 3. Schematic illustration of an experimental setup to generate a few-photon state that features any desired quantum statistics. The state of the atoms at each stage is shown by the spin quasi-probability distribution. The two-level excited atoms go into the first cavity and interact with a coherent state of the radiation field | . The output atoms are in a squeezed spin state (SSS). By interaction with a classical field in the second cavity, the mean spin vector is rotated to a desired direction, where the rotation axis can be specified by the phase shifter. The atoms then go into the third cavity and emit photons there. Left in the third cavity is the desired few-photon state which can be extracted by our changing the cavity quality factor.

The second scheme is to employ the atom trapping and the laser-cooling, in which the above three stages are implemented at the same place. For this purpose, the optical cavity should be off-resonant during the preparation of the atomic state, and be resonant only at the time of radiation. Interaction with the coherent state corresponding to the first stage above can be realized by interaction with the center-of-mass oscillation of atoms through the stimulated Raman transition [16]. This second scheme has the advantage of producing a large number of squeezed atoms. In an actual experiment, we must finish the whole sequence of processes before the two-level atoms decay into other levels. If we use, for example, the 63p3/2  61d3/2 transition of rubidium atoms, the lifetime is of order millisecond and the coupling constant is g  104 Hz. Since the required interaction time is gt  1, i.e., t  10-4 sec, the whole procedure can be accomplished within the atomic lifetime. The finite Q-factor of the cavity will not be an obstacle, since the cavity lifetime now reaches tc  10-1 sec in the microwave regime [2]. Thermal photons, however, must be carefully suppressed. If we use the above-mentioned transition (21.5 GHz), the temperature should be below, say, 0.2 K in order to suppress the average number of thermal photons in the cavity to below 0.01.

For a collection of atoms to be able to radiate a photon state that is squeezed in any desired direction in phase space, which we will refer to as tailor-made radiation, condition (7) has to be met for arbitrary .

This is because fluctuations projected on the Sx -Sy plane cannot be reduced ^min to below (S )2 in the direction of  by any rotation of the spin vector. This is why the Bloch state which has an isotropic uncertainty distribution with respect to the plane perpendicular to the mean spin vector cannot radiate the phase squeezed state.

Nor can a single atom be used for the tailor-made radiation, because it has no partner to be quantum-mechanically entangled with in order to meet condition (8).

In order to control the degree of squeezing of photons, we must solve the time evolution (2)-(6).

These so lutions are periodic functions with period (g 2S0 )-1 . The photon fluctuation (10) attains a minimum value  ^ (S-+/2 )2 0 /(2S0 ) at t = (2g 2S0 )-1 , and therefore the squeezed radiation can be obtained if the spin satisfies the condition (7) and the degree of squeezing is proportional to that of the spin. The expressions (10) and (11) imply that quantum fluctuation is transferred from the field to the atoms, as can be seen in Fig. 1(c). Several methods have been proposed to generate squeezed spin state: the Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the coherent state [13], or with the squeezed vacuum [7], and interaction of the spins through nonlinear Hamiltonians [11,4]. We focus our discussion to the first method. In Ref. [13] the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian (1) with the initial coherent state and the initial spin state |S, S are used, while in Ref. [7] the interaction ^ Hamiltonian H2 = h(^ S+ + aS- ) with the initial spin ¯ a ^ ^^ state |S, -S are used, where  is a coupling constant. Since these models are mathematically equivalent [14], we restrict our attention to the former. The quantity of our interest is the degree of squeezing of the spin obtained by the interaction with the coherent state, given the number of atoms. We seek the maximally squeezed spin state numerically, rotate it in various di-

We propose two possible experimental schemes to implement our theory. The first one is a scheme using the micromaser technique [15] as illustrated in Fig. 3, where the state of atoms is indicated in the spin quasiprobability distribution at each stage. It consists of three stages: (1) The excited two-level atoms are injected into the first cavity in which the atoms become squeezed by interacting with the coherent state of the radiation field | prepared by laser or maser [13]. (2) The output squeezed atoms pass through the coherent field with classical intensity. This field rotates the mean spin vector in the spin space to the desired direction. To control the rotation axis the coherent field and the classical field must be driven synchronously with an appropriate phase difference provided by the phase shifter. (3) The atoms go into the third vacuum cavity, radiate photons and come out of the cavity before reabsorbing the emitted photons. Left in the third cavity is the desired photon state which we can take out by switching the Q-factor of the cavity mechanically or by applying a magnetic field.

4 In conclusion, we have shown that the quantumstatistical information of collective atomic dipoles is faithfully transferred to the radiation field even in a fewphoton regime. This implies that we can produce a desired few-photon state by preparing atoms in an appropriate squeezed state. This idea can be tested using a high-Q cavity that sustains more than one atom undergoing the Jaynes-Cummings interaction with the radiation field.

FIG. 3. Schematic illustration of an experimental setup to generate a few-photon state that features any desired quantum statistics. The state of the atoms at each stage is shown by the spin quasi-probability distribution. The two-level excited atoms go into the first cavity and interact with a coherent state of the radiation field | . The output atoms are in a squeezed spin state (SSS). By interaction with a classical field in the second cavity, the mean spin vector is rotated to a desired direction, where the rotation axis can be specified by the phase shifter. The atoms then go into the third cavity and emit photons there. Left in the third cavity is the desired few-photon state which can be extracted by our changing the cavity quality factor.

The second scheme is to employ the atom trapping and the laser-cooling, in which the above three stages are implemented at the same place. For this purpose, the optical cavity should be off-resonant during the preparation of the atomic state, and be resonant only at the time of radiation. Interaction with the coherent state corresponding to the first stage above can be realized by interaction with the center-of-mass oscillation of atoms through the stimulated Raman transition [16]. This second scheme has the advantage of producing a large number of squeezed atoms. In an actual experiment, we must finish the whole sequence of processes before the two-level atoms decay into other levels. If we use, for example, the 63p3/2  61d3/2 transition of rubidium atoms, the lifetime is of order millisecond and the coupling constant is g  104 Hz. Since the required interaction time is gt  1, i.e., t  10-4 sec, the whole procedure can be accomplished within the atomic lifetime. The finite Q-factor of the cavity will not be an obstacle, since the cavity lifetime now reaches tc  10-1 sec in the microwave regime [2]. Thermal photons, however, must be carefully suppressed. If we use the above-mentioned transition (21.5 GHz), the temperature should be below, say, 0.2 K in order to suppress the average number of thermal photons in the cavity to below 0.01.

Quantum anti-Zeno effect

arXiv:quant-ph/9708024v1 13 Aug 1997

Prevention of a quantum system's time evolution by repetitive, frequent measurements of the system's state has been called the quantum Zeno effect (or paradox). Here we investigate theoretically and numerically the effect of repeated measurements on the quantum dynamics of the multilevel systems that exhibit the quantum localization of the classical chaos. The analysis is based on the wave function and Schr¨dinger equation, without introo duction of the density matrix. We show how the quantum Zeno effect in simple few-level systems can be recovered and understood by formal modeling the measurement effect on the dynamics by randomizing the phases of the measured states. Further the similar analysis is extended to investigate of the dynamics of multilevel systems driven by an intense external force and affected by frequent measurement. We show that frequent measurements of such quantum systems results in the delocalization of the quantum suppression of the classical chaos. This result is the opposite of the quantum Zeno effect. The phenomenon of delocalization of the quantum suppression and restoration of the classical-like time evolution of these quasiclassical systems, owing to repetitive frequent measurements, can therefore be called the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. From this analysis we furthermore conclude that frequently or continuously observable quasiclassical systems evolve basically in a classical manner.

I. INTRODUCTION Dynamics of a quantum system, which it is not being observed, can be described by the Schr¨dinger equation. In o the von Neumann axiomatics of quantum mechanics it is postulated that any measurement gives rise to an abrupt change of the state of the system under consideration and projects it onto an eigenstate of the measured observable. The measurement process follows irreversible dynamics, e.g. due to coupling with the multitude of vacuum modes if spontaneous radiation is registered, and causes the disappearance of coherence of the system's state: to the decay of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix or randomization of the phases of the wave function's amplitudes. It is known that a quantum system undergoes relatively slow (Gaussian, quadratic or cosine type but not exponential) evolution at an early period after preparation or measurement [1]. Therefore, the repetitive frequent observation of the quantum system can inhibit the decay of unstable [2] system and suppress dynamics of the driven by an external field [3, 4] system. This phenomenon, namely the inhibition or even prevention of the time evolution of the system from an eigenstate of observable into a superposition of eigenstates by repeated frequent measurement, is called the quantum Zeno effect (paradox) or the quantum watched pot [2-5]. Usually derivation and investigation of the quantum Zeno effect is based on the von Neumann's postulate of projection or reduction of the wave-packet in the measurement process. However, the outcome of the variation of the quantum Zeno effect in a three-level system, originally proposed by Cook [3] and experimentally realized by Itano et al. [4] has been explained by Frerichs and Schenzle [6] on the basis of the standard three-level Bloch equations for the density matrix in the rotating-wave approximation with the spontaneous relaxation. Thus, the quantum Zeno effect can be derived either from the ad hoc collapse hypothesis [2-4] or formulated in terms of irreversible quantum dynamics without additional assumptions, i.e. as the dynamical quantum Zeno effect [6,7]. Moreover, the postulate of the 'collapse of the wave function' models the actual measurement process only roughly [6]. Aharonov and Vardi [8] showed that frequent measurements can not only stop the quantum dynamics but it also can induce time evolution of the observable system. They used the von Neumann projection postulate and predicted an evolution of the system along a presumed trajectory due to a sequence of measurements performed on states that slightly change from measurement to measurement. Altenm¨ ller and Schenzle [9] have demonstrated that such a u phenomenon can be realized replacing the collapse hypothesis by an irreversible physical interaction. It should be noted that most of the systems analyzed in the papers mentioned above consist only of the few (usually two or three) quantum states and are purely quantum. Consequently, it is of interest to investigate the influence of the repeated frequent measurement on the evolution of the multilevel quasiclassical systems, the classical counterparts of which exhibit chaos. It has been established [10-12] that chaotic dynamics of such systems, e.g. dynamics of nonlinear systems strongly driven by a periodic external field, is suppressed by the quantum interference effect and it gives rise to the quantum localization of the classical dynamics in the energy space of the system. Thus, the quantum localization phenomenon strongly limits the quantum motion. As it was stated above, the repeated frequent measurement or continuous observation of the quantum system can inhibit its dynamics as well. Therefore, it is natural to expect that frequent measurement of the suppressed system will result in the additional freezing of the system's state. In connection with this question we should refer to the papers where the influence of small external noise, environment and measurement induced effects on the quantum chaos is analyzed (see [13-20] and references therein). The

2

general conclusion of such investigations is that noise, interaction with the environment and measurement induce the decoherence, irreversibility and delocalization. However, the direct link between measurements of the suppressed chaotic systems and the quantum Zeno effect, to the best of our knowledge, have not yet been analyzed. We can only refer to papers [21] where some preliminary relation between the quantum Zeno effect and the influence of repeated measurement on the dynamics of the localized quantum system is presented. The purpose of this paper is to investigate theoretically and numerically the influence of dense measurement on the evolution of the multilevel quasiclassical systems. The analysis of the measurement effect on the dynamics of the quantum systems is usually performed with the aid the density matrix formalism. However, the investigation of the quantum dynamics of the multilevel systems affected by repeated measurements is very difficult analytically and much time consuming in numerical calculations. The analysis based on the wave function and Schr¨dinger equation is considerably easier tractable and more evident. So, o first we will show how the quantum Zeno effect in a few-level-system can be described in terms of the wave function and Schr¨dinger equation without introducing of the density matrix and how the measurements can be incorporated o into the equations of motion. Further we will use the same method for the analysis of the dynamics of the multilevel system affected by repeated frequent measurement. We reveal that repetitive measurement of the multilevel systems with quantum suppression of classical chaos results in the delocalization of the states superposition and restoration of the chaotic dynamics. Since this effect is reverse to the quantum Zeno effect we call this phenomenon the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. II. DYNAMICS OF TWO-LEVEL SYSTEM Let's consider the simplest quantum dynamical process and the influence of frequent measurements on the outcome of the dynamics. Time evolution of the amplitudes a1 (t) and a2 (t) of the two-state wave function  = a1 (t)1 + a2 (t) 2 (2.1)

of the system in the resonance field (in the rotating wave approximation) or of the spin-half system in a constant magnetic field can be represented as 1 1 a1 (t) = a1 (0) cos t + ia2 (0) sin t 2 2 1 1 a2 (t) = ia1 (0) sin t + a2 (0) cos t, 2 2 (between time moments t = k and t = (k + 1) with integer k) and rewrite Eq. (2.2) in the mapping form a1 (k + 1) a2 (k + 1) where the evolution matrix A is given by A= cos  i sin  i sin  cos  , = 1 . 2 (2.4) =A a1 (k) a2 (k) (2.3) (2.2)

where  is the Rabi frequency. We introduce a matrix A representing time evolution during the time interval 

Evidently, the evolution of the amplitudes from time t = 0 to t = T = n can be expressed as a1 (n) a2 (n) = An a1 (0) a2 (0) . (2.5)

One can calculate matrix An by the method of diagonalization of the matrix A. The result naturally is An =

(2.6)

Equations (2.2)­(2.6) represent time evolution of the system without the intermediate measurements in the time interval 0 ÷ T . If at t = 0 the system was in the state 1 , i.e. a1 (0) = 1 and a2 (0) = 0, and if T =  then at the time moment t = T we would certainly find the system in the state 2 , i.e. it would be |a1 (T )| = 0 and |a2 (T )| = 1, a certain (with the probability 1) transition between the states. Note, that such quantum dynamics without the intermediate measurements is regular and coherent for all time until the final measurement. Let's consider now the dynamics of the system with the intermediate measurements every time interval  . Measurement of the system's state in the time moment t = k projects the system into the state 1 with the probability p1 (k) =| a1 (k) |2 or into the state 2 with the probability p2 (k) =| a2 (k) |2 . After the measurement we know the probabilities p1 (k) and p2 (k) but we have no information about the phases 1 (k) and 2 (k) of the amplitudes a1 (k) = |a1 (k)| ei1 (k) , a2 (k) = |a2 (k)| ei2 (k) , (2.7)
2 2

i.e. the phases 1 (k) and 2 (k) after every act of the measurement are random. Randomization of the phases after the measurement act can also be confirmed by the analysis of the definite measurement process, e.g. in the V-shape tree-level configuration with the spontaneous transition to the ground state [3-7]. Every measurement of the system's state results in the mutually uncorrelated phases 1 (k) and 2 (k). After the full measurement of the system's state these phases are uncorrelated with the phases of the amplitudes before the measurement too. That is why, according to the measurement postulate the outcome of the measurement does not depend on the phases of the amplitudes in the expansion of the wave function through the eigenfunctions of the measured observation. This will result in the absence of the influence of the interference terms in the expressions derived below on the transition probabilities between the eigenstates. Now we derive equations for the transition probabilities between the states in the case of evolution with intermediate measurements. From equations (2.3) and (2.4) we have | a1 (k + 1) |2 =| a1 (k) |2 cos2 + | a2 (k) |2 sin2 + | a1 (k)a2 (k) | sin [1 (k) - 2 (k)] sin 2, | a2 (k + 1) |2 =| a1 (k) |2 sin2 + | a2 (k) |2 cos2 - | a1 (k)a2 (k) | sin [1 (k) - 2 (k)] sin 2.

(2.8)

After the measurement in the time moment t = k the phase difference 1 (k) - 2 (k), according to the above statement, is random and the contribution of the last term in expressions (2.8) on the average for the large number of iterations equals zero. This results in the equation for the probabilities p1 (k + 1) p2 (k + 1) where M= cos2  sin2  sin2  cos2  4 (2.10) =M p1 (k) p2 (k) , (2.9)

is the evolution matrix for the probabilities. The full evolution from the initial time t = 0 until t = T with the (n - 1) equidistant intermediate measurement is described by the equation p1 (n) p2 (n) = Mn p1 (0) p2 (0) . (2.11)

The result of the calculation of the matrix Mn by the method of diagonalization of the matrix M is Mn = 1 2 1 + cosn 2 1 - cosn 2 1 - cosn 2 1 + cosn 2 . (2.12)

From Eqs. (2.11) and (2.12) we recover the quantum Zeno effect obtained by the density matrix technique [3-6]: if initially the system is in the state 1 , than the result of the evolution until the time moment T = n = / (after the -pulse) with the (n - 1) intermediate measurement will be characterized by the probabilities p1 (T ) and p2 (T ) for finding the system in the states 1 and 2 respectively: p1 (T ) =
2 1 1 2 (1 + cosn 2)  (1 + e- 2n )  1 -  1, 2 2 4n

p2 (T ) =

2 1 1 2 (1 - cosn 2)  (1 - e- 2n )   0, n  . 2 2 4n

(2.13)

We see that results of equations (2.11)-(2.13) represent the inhibition of the quantum dynamics by measurements and coincide with those obtained by the density matrix technique [3-6]. This also confirms correctness of the proposition that the act of the measurement can be represented as randomization of the amplitudes' phases. Further we will use this proposition and the same method for the analysis of the repeated measurement influence for the quantum dynamics of multilevel systems which classical counterparts exhibit chaos. We restrict ourselves to the strongly driven by a periodic force systems with one degree of freedom. The investigation is also based on the mapping equations of motion for such systems. III. QUANTUM MAPS FOR MULTILEVEL SYSTEMS In general the classical equations of motion are nonintegrable and the Schr¨dinger equation for strongly driven o systems can not be solved analytically. However, mapping forms of the classical and quantum equations of motion greatly facilitates the investigation of stochasticity and quantum­classical correspondence for the chaotic dynamics. From the standpoint of an understanding of the manifestation of the measurements for the dynamics of the multilevel systems the region of large quantum numbers is of greatest interest. Here we can use the quasiclassical approximation and convenient variables are the angle  and the action I. Transition from classical to the quantum (quasiclassical) ^ ¯ description can be undertaken replacing I by the operator I = -i  [22, 23]. (We use the system of units with h = 1).


One of the simplest systems in which the dynamical chaos and its quantum localization can be observed is a system with one degree of freedom described by the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 (I) and driven by periodic kicks. The full Hamiltonian H of the driven system can be represented as H(I, , t) = H0 (I) + k cos

 (t - j )

(3.1)

where  and k are the period and strength of the perturbation, respectively.

The intrinsic frequency of the unperturbed system is  = dH0 /dI. In particular, for a linear oscillator H0 = I. For H0 = I 2 /2 we have widely investigated rotator which results to the so-called standard map [12, 24], while the Hamiltonian (3.1) with H0 = / [2 (I0 + I)]1/2 and k = 2bF/ 5/3 (where b  0.411) models the highly excited atom in a monochromatic field of the strength F and frequency  [23,25-27]. Integration of the classical equations of motion for the Hamiltonian (3.1) over the perturbation period  leads to the classical map for the action and angle Ij+1 = Ij + k sin , j+1 = j +   (Ij+1 ) . (3.2)

In the case of rotator the unperturbed frequency is  (Ij+1 ) = Ij+1 and the map (3.2) coincides with the investigated in great detail standard map [12,22,24]. For the derivation of the quantum equations of motion we expand the state function (, t) of the system through the quasiclassical eigenfunctions, n () = ein / (2), of the Hamiltonian H0 , (, t) = (2)-1/2

where Jm (k) is the Bessel function. The form (3.4) of the map for the quantum dynamics is rather common: similar maps can be derived for the monochromatic perturbations as well, e.g. for an atom in a microwave field [23, 27]. A particular case of map (3.4), corresponding to the model of a quantum rotator H = I 2 /2, has been comprehensively investigated with the aim of determining the relationship between classical and quantum chaos [12,22,24]. It has been shown that under the onset of dynamical chaos at K   k > Kc = 0.9816, motion with respect to I is not bounded and it is of a diffusion nature in the classical case, while in the quantum description diffusion with respect to m is bounded, i.e. the diffusion ceases after some time and the state of the system localizes exponentially. The exponential localization length  of the quantum state is usually defined as follows:
N 

lim |am (N  )|2  exp(-

2|m - m0 | ) 

(3.5)

where m0 is the initial action. It has been shown in papers [10-12] that for a quantum rotator the localization length is   k 2 /2 . The effect of quantum limitation of dynamic chaos is extremely interesting and important. It reveals itself for many quantum systems which classical counterparts exhibit chaos. Note, that for the rotator the exact quantum description coincides with the quasiclassical one. Classical dynamics of the system described by map (3.2) in the case of global distinct stochasticity is diffusion-like with the diffusion coefficient in the I space B(I) = (I) /2 = k 2 /4. 6

(3.8)

Therefore, the expression for the local quantum diffusion coefficient coincides with the classical equation (3.6). However, it turns out that such a quantum diffusion takes place only for some finite time t  t   k 2 /2 [28] after which an essential decrease of the diffusion rate is observed. Such a behavior of quantum systems in the region of strong classical chaos is called "the quantum suppression of classical chaos" [10,11]. This phenomenon turns out to be typical for models (3.1) with nonlinear Hamiltonians H0 (I) and for other quantum systems. Thus, the diffusion coefficient (3.8) derived in the approximation of uncorrelated transitions (3.7) does not describe the true quantum dynamics in the energy space. The quantum interference effect is essential for such dynamics and it results in the quantum evolution being quantitatively different from the classical motion. Quantum equations of motion, i.e. the Schr¨dinger equation and o the maps for the amplitudes, are linear equations with respect to the wave function and probability amplitudes. Therefore, the quantum interference effect manifests itself even for quantum dynamics of the systems, the classical counterparts of which are described by nonlinear equations and chaotic dynamics of them exhibit a dynamical chaos. On the other hand, quantum equations of motion are very complex as well. Thus, the Schr¨dinger equation is a o partial differential equation with the coordinate and time dependent coefficients, while the system of equations for the amplitudes is the infinite system of equations. Moreover, for the nonlinear Hamiltonian H0 (m) the phases' increments, H0 (m) , during the free motion between two kicks while reduced to the basic interval [0, 2] are the pseudorandom quantities as a function of the state's quantum number m. This causes a very complicated and irregular quantum dynamics of the classically chaotic systems. We observe not only very large and apparently irregular fluctuations of probabilities of the states' occupation but also almost irregular fluctuations in time of the momentum dispersion (see curves (a) in the figures 1 and 2). However, the quantum dynamics of such driven by the external periodic force systems is coherent and the evolution of the amplitudes am (tj+1 ) in time is linear: they are defined by the linear map (3.4) with the time independent coefficients. The nonlinearity of the Hamiltonian H0 (I), being the reason of the classical chaos, causes the pseudorandom nature of the increments of the phases, H0 (m) , as a function of the state's number m (but constant in time). These increments of the phases remain the same for each kick. So, the dynamics of the amplitudes am (tj+1 ) = |am (tj+1 )| eim (tj+1 ) and of their phases, m (tj+1 ), is strongly deterministic and non-chaotic but very complicated and apparently irregular. For instance, the phases m (tj+1 ) are phases of the complex amplitudes, am (tj+1 ), which are linear combinations (3.4) of the complex amplitudes, an (tj ), before the preceding kick with the pseudorandom coefficients, e-iH0 (m) Jm-n (k). Nevertheless, the iterative equation (3.4) is a linear transformation with coefficients regular in time. That is why, we observe for such dynamics the quasiperiodic reversible in the time evolution [12] with the quantum localization of the pseudochaotic motion.

7

In paper [23] it has been demonstrated that this peculiarity of the pseudochaotic quantum dynamics is indeed due to the pseudorandom nature of the phases, H0 (m) , in Eq. (3.4) as a function of the eigenstate's quantum number m (but not of the kick's number j). Replacing the multipliers exp [-iH0 (m) ] in Eq. (3.4) by the expressions exp [-i2gm], where gm is a sequence of random numbers that are uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1], we observe the quantum localization as well [23]. The essential point here is the independence of the phases H0 (m) or 2gm on the step of iteration j or time t. This is the main core of difference from the randomness of the phases due to the measurements under consideration in the next Section. IV. INFLUENCE OF REPETITIVE MEASUREMENT ON THE QUANTUM DYNAMICS Each measurement of the system's state projects the state into one of the energy state m with the definite m. Therefore, if we make a measurement of the system after the kick j but before the next (j + 1) kick we will find the system in the states m with the appropriate probabilities pm (j) = |am (tj )| . In principle, such a measurement can be performed in the same way as in the experiment of Itano et al. [4], i.e. by the short-impulse laser excitation of the system from state m to some higher state followed by the irreversible return of the system to the same state m with registration of the state's population by photon counting. After the measurement of the state's m population, the probability of finding the system in the state m coincides with that before the measurement. However there is no interference between the state's m amplitude am (tj ) after the ~ measurement and amplitudes of other states, an (tj ), i.e. the cross terms containing the amplitude am (tj ) in the ~ expressions for probabilities vanish. But interference between the unmeasured states remains and the cross terms containing the amplitudes of the unmeasured states do not vanish. In the calculations of the system's dynamics the influence of the measurements can be taken into account in the same way as in the Section II, i.e. through randomization of phases of the amplitudes after the measurement of the appropriate state's populations. The phases of amplitudes after the measurement are completely random and uncorrelated with the phases before the measurement, after another measurements and with the phases of other measured or unmeasured states. Therefore, after the full measurement of the system after the kick j, all phases of the amplitudes am (tj ) are random. So, this full measurement of the system's state influences on the further dynamics of the system through the randomization of the phases of amplitudes (see Section II for analogy). This fact can be expressed by replacement in Eqs. (3.4) of the amplitudes am (tj+1 ) by the amplitudes eim (tj+1 ) am (tj+1 ) with the random phases m (tj+1 ). The essential point here is that the phases m (tj+1 ) are different, uncorrelated for the different measurements, i.e. for different time moments of the measurement tj+1 . This is the principal difference of the random phases m (tj+1 ) from the phases H0 (m) in Eqs. (3.4) which are pseudorandom variables as functions of the eigenstate's quantum number m (but not of the time moment tj+1 ). In such a way, introducing the appropriate random phases we can analyze the influence on the system's dynamics of the full measurements of the system's state performed after every kick, after every N kicks or of the measurements of the population probabilities just of some states, e.g. only of the initial state. Note that there is no need to measure more frequently than after every kick because the results of the subsequent measurements before the next kick repeat the results of the preceding measurements (after the last kick). Instead of representing the detailed quantum dynamics expressed as the evolution of all amplitudes in the expansion

(4.1)

where m0 is the initial momentum (quantum number). Such a representation of the dynamics is simpler, more picturesque and more comfortable for comparison with the classical dynamics. In figures 1 and 2 we show the results of numerical analysis of the influence of measurements of the system's state on the quantum dynamics of the rotator and of the system with random distribution of energy levels, i.e. for random phases H0 (m) in Eqs. (3.4) as a function of the eigenstate's quantum number m. We see that quantum diffusion-like dynamics of the systems without measurements, represented by curves (a), after sufficiently short time t   k 2 /2 (of the order of 50 in our case) ceases and the monotonic increase of the momentum dispersion (m - m0 )2  2Bt =
k2 2 t

for time t  t turns for the time t  t into the stationer (on the average for same time interval t  t ) distribution with the momentum dispersion (mst - m0 )2  2 /2  k 4 /8. This is a demonstration of the effect of quantum suppression of the classical chaos. In the case of measurement of the only initial, 500 , state's population after every kick (which technically is achieved by introduction of the random phase 500 (tj+1 ) after every kick j ) we observe monotonic, though slow, increase of the momentum dispersion for very long time, until t  600 in our case (curves (b) in figures 1 and 2). After such time the population of the initial state on the average becomes very small and measurements of this state's population almost does not influence on the systems dynamics. The dynamics with measurements of all states every 200 kicks represented by curves (c) is a staircase-like: fast increase of the momentum dispersion after the immediate measurement turns into the quantum suppression of the diffusion-like motion for t  t until the next measurement destroys the quantum interference and induces the succeeding diffusion-like motion. The quantum dynamics of the kicked rotator or some other system with measurements of all states' populations after every kick as represented by the curves (d) is essentially classical-like: the momentum dispersion increases linearly in time with the classical diffusion coefficient (3.6) for all time of the calculation. Theoretically such differences of dynamics can be understood from the iterative equations for the momentum dispersion: (mj+1 - m0 )2 =

(m - m0 ) |am (tj+1 )| ,

For the random phase differences of the amplitudes an (tj ) and

a  n

(tj ) with n = n, which is a case after the



measurement of the system's state, the second term of Eq. (4.4) on the average equals zero (see Section II for 9

In the derivation of Eq. (4.5) we have used the summation expressions

Therefore, according to Eq. (4.5) for the uncorrelated phases of the amplitudes an (tj ) and a  (tj ) with n = n the n dispersion of the momentum as a result of every kick increases on the average in the magnitude k 2 /2, the same as for the classical dynamics. For dynamics of isolated quantum systems without measurements or unpredictable interaction with the environment the second term of Eq. (4.4), due to the quantum interference between the amplitudes of different states arisen from the same initial states' superposition, compensate (on the average for sufficiently large time interval t  t ) the first term of Eq.(4.4) and so the quantum suppression of dynamics may be observed. Similar analysis can be used for the investigation of the influence of the measurements on quantum dynamics of another quantum systems with quantum localization of the classical chaos as well. As it has already been stated above the influence of the repetitive measurement on quantum dynamics is closely related with the affect of the unpredictable interaction between the system and the environment. It should be noticed that in general for the analysis of the measurement effect and to facilitate the comparison between quantum and classical dynamics of chaotic systems it is convenient to employ the Wigner representation, W (x, p, t), of the density matrix [19, 29]. The Wigner function of the system with the Hamiltonian of the form H = p2 /2m + V (x, t) evolves according to equation W = {H, W }M  {H, W } + t h ¯ 2n (-1)  2n+1 V  2n+1 W , 22n (2n + 1)! x2n+1 p2n+1

where by {...}M and {...} are denoted the Moyal and the Poisson brackets, respectively. The terms in Eq. (4.6) containing Planck's constant and higher derivatives give the quantum corrections to the classical dynamics generated by the Poisson brackets. In the region of regular dynamics one can neglect the quantum corrections for very long time if the characteristic actions of the system are large. For classically chaotic motion the exponential instabilities lead to the development of the fine structure of the Wigner function and exponential growth of its derivatives. As a result, the quantum corrections become significant after relatively short time even for macroscopic bodies [19, 28]. The extremely small additional diffusion-like terms in Eq. (4.6), which reproduce the effect of interaction with the environment or frequent measurement, prohibits development of the Wigner function's fine structure and removes barriers posed by classical chaos for the correspondence principle [19, 29]. V. CONCLUSIONS From the above analysis we can conclude that the influence of the repetitive measurement on the dynamics of the quasiclassical multilevel systems with the quantum suppression of the classical chaos is opposite to that for the few-level quantum system. The repetitive measurement of the multilevel systems results in delocalization of the states superposition and acceleration of the chaotic dynamics. In the limit of the frequent full measurement of 10

the system's state the quantum dynamics of such systems approaches the classical motion which is opposite to the quantum Zeno effect: inhibition or even prevention of time evolution of the system from an eigenstate of observable into a superposition of eigenstates by repeated frequent measurement. Therefore, we can call this phenomenon the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. It should be noted that the same effect can be derived without the ad hoc collapse hypothesis but from the quantum theory of irreversible processes, in analogy with the method used in the papers [6, 9]. Even the simplest detector follows irreversible dynamics due to the coupling to the multitude of vacuum modes which results in the randomization of the quantum amplitudes' phases, decay of the off-diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix and to smoothing of the fine structure of the Wigner distribution function, i.e. just what we need to obtain the classical equations of motion. So, the quantum-classical correspondence problem caused by the chaotic dynamics is closely related with the old problem of measurement in quantum mechanics. In the case of frequent measurement or unpredictable interaction with the environment the quantum dynamics of the quasiclassical systems approaches the classical-like motion.

Abstract A method to study weakly bound three-body quantum systems in two dimensions is formulated in coordinate space for short-range potentials. Occurrences of spatially extended structures (halos) are investigated. Borromean systems are shown to exist in two dimensions for a certain class of potentials. An extensive numerical investigation shows that a weakly bound two-body state gives rise to two weakly bound three-body states, a reminiscence of the Efimov effect in three dimensions. The properties of these two states in the weak binding limit turn out to be universal. PACS number(s): 03.65.Ge, 21.45.+v, 31.15.Ja, 02.60Nm

Introduction. Characteristic properties of halo systems are binding energies much smaller than the typical energy of the interaction and spatial extensions much larger than the range of the potential [1, 2]. Three-body halos in three dimensions exhibit many interesting features. Borromean systems, discovered now experimentally, are bound three-body structures where none of the two-body subsystems are bound [3, 4, 5]. The Thomas and Efimov effects are anomalies due to a singularity which occurs in a three-body system when the ratio of scattering length and effective range is infinitely large [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Then the effective three-body potential behaves as the inverse square of the distance which results in infinitely many three-body bound states. The Thomas effect corresponds to an infinitely small effective range. The Efimov effect is associated with an infinitely large scattering length where the wave functions of excited states reside in the tail region of the effective threebody potential. Physical examples of these might possibly exist in nature [10, 11, 12]. The three-body halos in two dimensions are less studied and the present investigations [13, 14, 15, 16] are limited in various ways. It has been proven [16] that the number of bound states is always finite. However, the possibility of existence of a Borromean state has not been examined and therefore the number of bound states is not established. Moreover the properties of these states have not been investigated in detail.

In this letter we shall for simplicity only consider a system of three identical bosons in two dimensions. The purpose is to (i) formulate an efficient method to solve the coordinate space Faddeev equations in two dimensions, applicable for arbitrary short-range two-body potentials, (ii) derive asymptotic equations for the effective three-body potential which alleviate crucially the numerical investigations of weakly bound systems, (iii) discuss the possible existence of Borromean systems, halos, Efimov and Thomas effects and (iv) illustrate numerically the universal properties of the three-body halos. The method. We shall use the method developed for three dimensions [9]. Let rjk = (rj - rk ) be the distance between particles j and k, ri(jk) = -ri + (rj + rk )/2 the distance between particle i and the center of mass of particles j and k. All particles have the same mass m. The Jacobi coordinates are then  introduced as xi = rjk / 2, yi = ri(jk) 2/3. The hyperspherical coordinates 2 in two dimensions are given by {, i }  {, i , xi , yi },  = x2 + yi , i = i arctan(xi /yi ), xi and yi are the azimuthal angles of xi and yi . The volume element in hyperspherical coordinates is 3 ddxi dyi sin i cos i di and the kinetic energy operator is T = h ¯2 2m --3/2 ^  2 3/2 3/4 2  + 2 + 2 2    , (1)

Here V is the two-body potential and the expansion coefficients fn () satisfy the system of coupled equations - 2 n + 3/4 2mE fn () + - Qnn - 2 2 2   h ¯  fn () , = Qnn + 2Pnn

The physical solutions are equivalent to the solutions of the Schr¨dinger equao tion in Eq.(4) but these equations are better suited for descriptions of subtle correlations. The s-wave motion is responsible both for the long distance behavior and the Thomas and Efimov effects. We therefore restrict to s-waves where the (i) wavefunction n only depends on  and i . The Faddeev components in Eq.(9) must all be expressed in the same set of Jacobi coordinates. This amounts for swaves to rewriting one set of coordinates in terms of the other and a subsequent integration over the angular variables x and y , i.e. (,  )  1 2

 Large-distance behavior. We define an angle 0 such that 2m2 V ( 2 sin 0 )/¯ 2 = h |()| and we assume that the potential is of short range, that is 0 approaches zero with increasing . If  > 0 the potential is then negligible for large  and Eq.(12) becomes - 2  - 2 cot(2) -  () = 0. 2  (13)

where   4( + 1) and P and Q are Legendre functions. At small  this solution behaves as () = 2 sin() ( + log  + (1 + )) + cos() + O(2 ) ,

where  is the digamma function and  is Euler's constant. Without interactions the solution in Eq.(14) with the boundary condition of zero derivative at  = 0 provides the quantization rule  = 0, 1, 2..., see Eq.(15).

Then Eq.(12) simplifies to a differential equation with an inhomogeneous term -  2  2m - 2 cot(2) + 2 2 V ( 2 sin ) 2   h ¯ 2m 2  - () = - 2  V ( 2 sin )2(/3) . h ¯

(17)

The homogeneous part of this equation reduces for small  by the substitution  o r =  2 to the two dimensional Schr¨dinger equation for two particles. Thus, assuming that  can be neglected compared to 2m2 V /¯ 2 , the large-distance h ( < 0  1) solutions to the homogeneous part of Eq.(17) simply are the zero-energy two-body solutions. Then for   0 the physical solution is ap proximately C log 2/a , where C is an arbitrary constant and a is the scattering length defined as the distance where the two-body wave function for zero energy is zero.

Therefore this eigenvalue   4(+1) is approaching zero in both these limiting cases in contrast to three dimensions where a negative constant asymptotically is approached when the scattering length is infinitely large.

 inside the potential at r0 = 0 2. For small binding we can use the zeroenergy solution which at r  r0 is log (r/a). This matching gives the above B and k and the result is accurate to the order r0 /a. For attractive zero-range potential it is therefore exact. For the potentials without two-body bound state, where r0 /a is not small, this particular solution does not exist. The wavefunction is exponentially small everywhere except in a small region close to  = 0, see Eq.(21). In this region the zero-range wave function obtained  from Eq.(17) is proportional to K0 (kr = k0 2) and after normalization approximately given by  ()  2kK0 2k .

When R  0, the phenomenon is called the Thomas effect and when a   it is called the Efimov effect. Eq.(27) is in two dimensions replaced by Eq.(19) and the Efimov effect is therefore not present in two dimensions. Furthermore, the hyperradial potential has even for zero-range potentials a repulsive centrifugal barrier at small distance. Then the Thomas collapse is not possible and the three-body system must for zero-range potentials have a finite number of bound states. Equations (19) and (27) can be formally written in terms of hypergeometric function as one general equation for d-dimensions, where d is a real number. The asymptotic solution  of this equation leads to the Efimov and Thomas effects in the region 2.3< d <3.8.

Bound states. The solutions to the zero-range potentials are similar to those of purely attractive weak potentials. The two-body system has at least one bound state and for such interactions Borromean systems do not exist in two dimensions. The three-body ground state is more bound and an excited state is in addition always present. In Fig.1 is shown the effective radial potential together with the resulting two bound-state wave functions. The corresponding root mean square radii are in units of the scattering length respectively < (r/a)2 >1/2 = 0.111, 0.927. Their large sizes are reminiscent of the three-dimensional Efimov states with an extension comparable to the scattering length. The energies E3 of these states are given in terms of the two-body boundstate energy E2 as E3 /E2 = 16.52, 1.267. We have numerically tried to find a third bound state with weaker binding energy and larger radial extension by calculating the zero-energy wavefunction and looking at the number of nodes. Even a careful search to about 103 times the scattering length did not reveal another bound state. This strongly indicates that only two bound states exist. The large proportionality factor for the ground state energy can be considered a reminiscence of the Thomas effect. These relations are still valid for arbitrary weakly attractive, finite-range potentials. This is because weak binding corresponds a scattering length much larger than the range of the potential, which is the limit of a zero-range potential. In Fig.2 we show the ratio (E3 - E2 )/E2 as function of |E2 | for different potentials. We first notice that there are always two states which in the weak binding limit approach the results for zero-range potential (marked with small circles). The purely attractive potentials (solid lines) as well as repulsive core potentials (dashed lines) fall approximately on the same universal curves. This is 7

equivalent to the observation in three dimensions that only low-energy scattering properties like the scattering length are important in the weak binding limit. The potentials with a short-range repulsive barrier (dash-dot and dotted lines), unlike the repulsive core, produce energies deviating in the middle of the plot from the universal curves. The reason is that a sufficiently large barrier and a sufficiently large attraction produce a three-body ground state confined inside the barrier, that yields three bound states in total. As |E2 | then decreases towards zero two cases are possible. If the potential does not allow the spatially confined ground state the third bound state disappears and the first two approach the zero-range limit (dotted lines). If, however, the potential allows a spatially confined ground state, all three states survive in the small |E2 | limit (dash-dot lines). Now the second and the third bound states approach the zero-range limit, while the ground state energy remains finite. In this case the ground state persists even into the region where two-body state is unbound, creating thus a Borromean phenomenon. This is only possible with a repulsive confining barrier which therefore also limits the spatial extension of the threebody system. The properties of Borromean systems are therefore different in two and three dimensions. Conclusions. Based on the hyperspherical expansion of the Faddeev equations we have investigated the possible structure of three weakly bound identical bosons in two dimensions. For purely attractive two-body potentials and the potentials with repulsive cores the Borromean systems do not exist. For two-body potentials with a short-range repulsive barrier the two-body system may not have a bound state while a three-body bound state exists. Borromean

8

systems are therefore possible in two dimensions. We find numerically that a weakly bound two-body state is always accompanied by two bound three-body states, resembling the Efimov states in three dimension. If a Borromean state is present there are therefore in total three bound three-body states. For all types of potentials, two of these three-body bound states have energies and radii following a universal curve in the weak binding limit. Their sizes scale with the two-body scattering length and can therefore become arbitrarily large in analogy to s-state halos in three dimensions.

Differences between trajectory and Copenhagen analyses of an impulse perturbation

Abstract The trajectory and Copenhagen representations render different predictions for impulse perturbations. We investigate a small perturbing impulse acting on the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. For the two representations, the first-order perturbation calculations for time-dependent change in energy differ. The change in energy is a function of time for the trajectory representation and is dependent upon the microstate of the wave function.

INTRODUCTION

The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics has been consistent with observations of large ensembles. But it only renders a probability of outcomes for individual events. Heretofore, the mainstream of physics has considered causal theories of quantum mechanics to be only alternative representations that rendered nothing new and, likewise, only predicted probabilities for outcomes. For example, Bohm's stochastic causal theory of quantum mechanics [1], which purports to be consistent with the probability amplitude of the wave function, introduces chance by precept. Nevertheless, the Schr¨dinger wave function of the o Copenhagen interpretation is not an exhaustive description of quantum phenomenon because the trajectory representation distinguishes microstates, each specifying a distinct trajectory, of the wave function [2-4]. Regrettably, we presently do not have a quantum operator that produces these microstates directly. Herein, we investigate a situation where the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations render different results and where there exists a quantum operator that produces the Copenhagen result. We investigate a perturbing impulse acting on a particle in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. First-order perturbation calculations for the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations render different results. There exists a quantum operator, the Hamiltonian, for making the Copenhagen prediction. This renders a counter example where a causal theory, the trajectory representation, can predict something new and different from the Copenhagen interpretation. An investigation of the particle behavior during perturbation is sufficient to establish this counter example. The perturbing potential has an impulse in time described by a -function while the spatial dependence is antisymmetrical, linear and limited to a small but finite domain of the square well. This perturbing potential has been chosen for five reasons. First, it accentuates the difference in the behavior of energy as a function of time between the two representations. Second, first-order perturbation theory suffices for 1

exhibiting differences between the two representations. Third, the physics of how this perturbing potential effects energy as a function of time is easily understood. Fourth, we can spatially confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of the nodes of the ground state (at the well's edge) of the infinitely deep square well while we concurrently confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of nodes of latent excited states. This ensures that all perturbation matrix elements will be small. And fifth, it is mathematically tractable where work can be done using algebraic expressions or elementary functions. Where necessary, approximations can be done by reasonable algebraic expressions that do not lose any physics. The trajectory representation and the Schr¨dinger representation without the Copenhagen interpretao tion mutually imply each other [4]. The Copenhagen interpretation assigns a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function. Lest we forget, Schr¨dinger opposed the Copenhagen interpretation of his wave o o function. Nothing herein implies that time-dependent perturbation theory for a trajectory representation is easier than that for contemporary wave mechanics. It is much more difficult. It is even more difficult in general than classical canonical perturbation theory. But then, we ask so much more from trajectory perturbations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 addresses the physics of a particle in an infinitely deep square well before a perturbing impulse acts on the particle. Section 3 addresses the differences between the time-dependent perturbation of energy for the two representations.

BEFORE PERTURBATION

Unperturbed System: Let us consider initially that a particle is in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well whose (unperturbed) potential is given by V (x) = , 0, |x| > q |x|  q (1)

where q is finite positive. The trajectory representation is based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. The timeindependent generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics for a particle is given for onedimensional motion in the x-direction by [3-5] (W/x)2 h ¯2 + V - Ex = - < W;x > (2) 2m 4m where W/x is conjugate momentum, E is the energy for the particle, m is mass of the particle, and h ¯ = h/(2) where in turn h is Planck's constant. The term < W ; x > in Eq. (2) is the Schwarzian derivative of Hamilton's characteristic function, W , with respect to x. The Schwarzian derivative is given by < W ; x >= 3  3 W/x3 - W/x 2  2 /W x2 W/x
2

.

The left side of Eq. (2) manifests the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation while the Schwarzian derivative on the right side manifests the higher order quantum effects. The general solution for W/x is given by [3,4] W/x = ±(2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1 (3)

where (a, b, c) is a set of real coefficients such that a, b > 0, and (, ) is a set of normalized independent solutions of the associated time-independent one-dimensional Schr¨dinger equation, o -¯ 2 d2  h + (V - E) = 0 2m dx2

where  is the Schr¨dinger wave function. The independent solutions (, ) are normalized so that their o Wronskian, W(, ) =  d/dx - d/dx , is scaled to give W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)] > 0. (The h nonlinearity of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation induces this normalization upon W [4].) This ensures that (a2 + b2 + c) > 0. We note for completeness that a particular set (, ) of independent solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation may be chosen by the superposition principle so that the coefficient c o is zero. The motion in phase space is specified by Eq. (3). This phase-space trajectory is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The ± sign in Eq. (3) designates that the motion may be in either x-direction. The corresponding solution for the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, W , is given by [3,4] W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 +K (4)

where K is an integration constant, which we may set to zero herein. The unperturbed energy, E, and action variable, J, for the ground state are quantized by E = h2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = ¯ 2 J /(32mq 2 ). The relationship between E and J is consistent with classical mechanics where Eclassical = J 2 /(32mq 2 ). The quantization of E and J are independent of the coefficients a, b and c [3]. Subsequently, the wave number for the ground state is specified to be k = /(2q). The set of independent solutions (, ) for this unperturbed square well is chosen such that  represents the symmetric bound state given by 2m - c2 /4)

(Note that limV E  ¯ 2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = E.) The other h h solution, , is unbound and is not unique as any amount of  may be added to it. While  represents the symmetric bound state, the corresponding  that we have chosen is antisymmetric. We present this unbound solution as  1/2 E V  lim  x>q cosh[(x - q)] - V exp[(x - q)]  ,  V V-E 1/4   2m sin(kx), -q  x  q = ·  h ¯ 2 k 2 (ab - c2 /4)   1/2  E V  lim x < -q. - cosh[(x + q)] + V exp[(x + q)]  -, V-E

V

We have retained the limiting process as an intermediate step in describing  and  in the classically forbidden region, |x| > q, to facilitate evaluating the Wronskian there. The corresponding Wronskian gives W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 everywhere as expected. The (unperturbed) ground state Schr¨dinger h o wave function is well known to be  x>q  0,   = q -1/2 cos(kx), -q  x  q    0, x < -q.

Microstates: For bound states in general and the ground state in particular, microstates of the Schr¨dinger o wave function exist where the particular choice of the set of coefficients (a, b, c) specifies a unique trajectory in phase space for a given quantized energy E or quantized action variable J as developed elsewhere [4].

Each microstate is consistent with the bound-state Schr¨dinger wave function for the bound state can also o be expressed by [3,4] (2m)1/4 cos(W/¯ ) h [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 (W/x)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 cos arctan [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 = . (5)

Thus, before the perturbing impulse acts on the particle, each microstate of the ground state has the same quantized energy as the Schr¨dinger wave function. o Hamilton's characteristic function is a generator of motion. The equation of motion in the domain [x, t] is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for a constant coordinate (often called Jacobi's theorem). The procedure simplifies for coordinates whose conjugate momenta are separation constants. For stationarity, E is a separation constant for time. Thus, the equation of motion for the trajectory time, t, relative to its constant coordinate  , is given as a function of x by t -  = W/E (6)

where the trajectory for a given energy, E, is a function of a set of coefficients (a, b, c) and  specifies the epoch. We see that a Hamilton-Jacobi development of the trajectory representation does not return us to the classical representation because we must consider microstates, which do not occur in an infinitely deep, classical square well. The trajectory associated with a microstate of given energy E may be specified by the set of coefficients (a, b, c) or by the set of initial conditions (xo , xo , xo ) [3]. On the other hand, classical  ¨ motion in one dimension is simpler for it is specified for a given E by the initial condition xo . Nevertheless, the particular microstate, a = b and c = 0, does correspond to the contemporary concept of classical motion.

DURING PERTURBATION

Perturbing System: Let us now apply a spatially dependent impulse at time  to the quantum particle in the ground state. The time-dependent perturbing potential, F V (x, t), is a spatially dependent impulse given by  |x| > q or |x|  q -   0,   x + q - , -q  x < -q +  F V (x, t) = (t - )F · (7)    x - q + , q-<xq

where F is a factor with units of force and where 0 <   q. The spatial dependence of V is intentionally antisymmetric to simplify our investigation. Let us now calculate the first-order changes in energy induced by F V (x, t). We compare the calculated changes both for a Copenhagen interpretation based upon the standard time-dependent perturbation theory for the Schr¨dinger representation and for a trajectory representation based upon a conical, generalized o Hamilton-Jacobi perturbation theory. Both theories are based upon variation of parameters. Different firstorder predictions in E are exhibited for the two perturbation methods. First order changes in E are sufficient for our comparison because we are free to make  and F as small as necessary. We first apply the standard wave-function time-dependent perturbation theory. The variation in the coefficient (parameter) of the ground state, C0 (the coefficient of the eigenfunction that, by itself, specified the particle before time ) is well known and given by i¯ C0 = F (V )00 C0 + O(F 2 ) h 4

where (V )00 =< 0|V |0 >. As V is spatially antisymmetric, the matrix element, (V )00 , is zero. Thus, C0 does not vary to first order in F . Therefore, as is well known, the complex behavior of C0 (t), to first order in F , does not induce any change in angular frequency due to a finite (V )00 . Ergo, the energy of the particle to first order in F remains constant and equal to the unperturbed energy. We now apply a canonical perturbation expansion, based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi theory to the trajectory representation theory. To do this, we allow the parameters E and  , which were constants of the motion in the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq. (6), to be varied as a function of time by the perturbation. (Energy is no longer a separation constant for a time-dependent Hamiltonian; consequently, the "constant coordinate",  , is also no longer a constant coordinate.) We expand E and  in a power series in F . As we are only interested in the first order term of energy, we shall compute this term only. The generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (2) manifests the same canonical transformation that generates the classical Hamilton-Jacobi transformation [6]. Hence, the equations of motion for the variables (E,  ) for the trajectory representation are the same as those for classical perturbation theory. These well known equations of motion given by  E = F V (E, , t)/ and  = -F V (E, , t)/E. 

If the perturbation is small [we are free to make (F, ) as small as required], then we can produce a first-order approximation (E1 , 1 ) to the time variation of (E,  ) by using the constant, unperturbed values (E0 , 0 ) on the right sides of the above equations. For the perturbation of expansion of interest (the expansion of E), we must solve  E1 = -F V (E0 , 0 , t)/0 . (8)

In solving the above equations for our perturbation, which is not an explicit function of momentum, we must express x in V as a function of (E, , t). This requires us to turn the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq (6), inside out. Reversion of t(x) to x(t): The unperturbed equation of motion is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation, Eq. (6), which renders ±2 mx (ab - c2 /4)1/2 hk ¯ (9) a + b + (a - b) cos(2kx) + c sin(2kx) where the ± sign indicates that motion may be in either direction. The trajectory is dependent upon the coefficients (a, b, c), which specify the particular microstate. If a = b or c = 0, then Eq. (9) is a transcendental equation that cannot be turned inside out to solve for x in closed form. But the spatial dependence of V (x, t) is non-zero only over two small regions: -q  x < -q +  and q -  < x  q. In these two regions we may expand the trigonometric functions in a Maclaurin series about -q and q respectfully. For example, we may express Eq. (9) for a particle traveling in the +x-direction in the domain -q  x < -q +  as t- = t- = ± mx (ab - c2 /4)1/2 hk ¯ + O[(x + q)3 ], 0  x + q    1. b + ck(x + q) + (b - a)k 2 (x + q)2 (10)

In Eq. (10), keeping the Maclaurin series expansion of the trigonometric functions only up to second order still captures the physical nuances of the microstates as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c) (again,  may be made as small as necessary). If we ignore the O[(x + q)3 ] terms in Eq. (10), we may now turn the equation of motion inside out to approximate (x + q) as a quadratic solution to Eq. (10). An approximate (x + q) as a function of (E, , t) may be given for a particle traveling in the +x-direction as

This follows for G can be expressed entirely by other constants of the motion and other physical constants. We have G = (2m)1/2 I/(¯ W) where W is, as previously given, the Wronskian h for the set of independent solutions (, ) and I is the Ermakov invariant [5] given by I = [a - c2 /(4b)]-1 .

where the "T " in "T bF " in the above is a unit measure in time. This "T " manifests that -function impulse has been integrated over time domain that includes the instant that the -function acts. If the particle is between -q and -q +  at time , then the particle and the system causing the perturbing force will transfer energy between each other. The amount of energy transferred to first order in F is given by the magnitude of E1 . The direction of transfer is given by the sign of E1 . From Eq. (13), E1 is a function of the particular microstate as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c). The energy for the particle is E = E0 + E1 + O(F 2 ). Let us simplify E1 by considering the particular microstate where the coefficients are specified by a = b and c = 0. Then, Eq. (11) becomes exact, and Eq. (13) becomes exactly h ¯k mq m(q - ) T, <  - 0  - . (14) m h ¯k h ¯k This simplified case has an intuitive physical interpretation. We see that the particle does work on the perturbing system to first order by transferring the energy E1 to it. The amount of energy is proportional to the force factor, F , and the distance that the particle transits against this force during the perturbation's duration. The transit distance for a = b and c = 0 is given by the product of particle velocity, hk/m, and ¯ one unit of time denoted by "T " in Eq. (14). This is also what we would intuitively expect from classical perturbation theory. We report that if the particle had been traveling in the +x-direction and had been located between q -  and q at time  , then E1 would be given by E1 |a=b,c=0 = -F

as expected. Now we consider the effect of the perturbation upon a particle travelling in the -x-direction. We arbitrarily assume that the cycle of interest is one for which particle motion in the +x-direction occurs first. When the particle reflects at the well boundary x = q, the trajectory in phase space rounds a singular point and jumps from the Riemann sheet for +x motion for that cycle to the Riemann sheet for -x motion for that cycle. Innate to this jumping of Riemann sheets is a shift in the epoch  . As t|x=q must be the same for both Riemann sheets, we have from Eq.

But we note that the first order E1 is zero here for any microstate of the trajectory representation because the particle is not located in a space-time location where the perturbation acts. On the other hand, under the Copenhagen interpretation, for first perturbation, (V )00 is zero for an entirely different reason: because the Copenhagen interpretation gives expectations averaged over an ensemble of identically prepared systems. Here, "identically prepared" under the Copenhagen interpretation is construed to mean identical wave function without considering microstates. Nevertheless, if we took the average E1 as determined by assuming that we did not know what the particle's position was at time  and also assumed a uniform distribution of  over the duration of one cycle, then by Eqs. (13)­(18) < E1 >average= 0 as expected for the expectation value in quantum mechanics corresponds to the time average in classical theory [7]. Physically, averaging E1 for a uniform distribution of  manifests that the perturbing system is as likely to do work on the particle as the particle is likely to do work on the perturbing system. Even if we did not know the particle's position at time  but could assume a distribution of  , then we still could still predict a distribution of E1 consistent with the assumed distribution of  . Usually, the orbital period is assumed to be shorter than the duration of the perturbation in classical systems. This assumptions allows us to simplify by averaging over the orbit. But we consider here the reverse situation with an impulse perturbation. Hence, we must take into account the particles position at the time of perturbing impulse and what it is doing then [i.e., x(), x() and x()] as described by unperturbed energy  ¨ the particular microstate. In contrast for classical motion, we need only consider unperturbed energy and the position, x(), of the particle at the time of perturbation impulse. In conclusion, we do know where the particle is in trajectory theory. The time dependence of the perturbing system is a -function. Ergo, we can predict individual results, E1 , in trajectory theory that differ with the predictions of the Copenhagen interpretation that are based upon ensemble averages! Furthermore, the trajectory predictions are a function of the particular microstate. References 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. D. Bohm and B. J. Hiley, Phys. Rep. 144, 323 (1987). E. R. Floyd, Phys. Rev.

Abstract The trajectory and Copenhagen representations render different predictions for impulsive perturbations. The different predictions are due to the different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations. We investigate a small perturbing impulse acting on the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. For the two representations, the first-order perturbation calculations for the temporal change in energy differ. This temporal change in energy for the trajectory representation is dependent upon the microstate of the wave function. We show that even under Copenhagen epistemology, the two representations predict different theoretical results.

INTRODUCTION

The trajectory interpretation has strong causality by precept. Bohr, the chief founder of the Copenhagen interpretation, held that causality had to be dropped for a consistent quantum theory.1 Born, another founder of the Copenhagen interpretation, asserted "in the quantum theory it is the principle of causality, or more accurately that of determination, which must be dropped" (emphases in original).2 More recent champions of the Copenhagen interpretation have construed "causality" to be the temporal evolution of the Schr¨dinger wave function with time.3,4 (We shall use herein this evolved usage of "causality" with regard o to the Copenhagen interpretation.) This causality for the Copenhagen interpretation is a weak causality. The different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations are fundamental and manifest different theoretical predictions. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics has been consistent with observations of large ensembles. But it only renders a probability of outcomes for individual events. Heretofore, the mainstream of physics has considered strong causal theories of quantum mechanics to be only alternative representations that rendered nothing new and, likewise, only predicted probabilities for outcomes. For example, Bohm's stochastic causal theory of quantum mechanics, which purports to be consistent with the probability amplitude of the wave function, introduces chance by precept.5 1

On the other hand, the trajectory representation is not based upon chance.6-8 The trajectory itself is strongly causal and deterministic. The trajectory representation has shown that the Born postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation, which attributes a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function, is o unnecessary.9 The trajectory representation has shown that the Schr¨dinger wave function of the Copenhagen o interpretation is not an exhaustive description of quantum phenomenon because the trajectory representation distinguishes microstates, each specifying a distinct trajectory, of the wave function.6-8 Each trajectory or microstate is sufficient by itself to specify the Schr¨dinger wave function.7 We need not invoke an ensemble o of trajectories to get the Schr¨dinger wave function. The trajectory representation renders deterministic o predictions for an individual particle viz-a-viz the probability predictions of the Copenhagen representation for an ensemble of particles.9 Herein, we investigate a situation where the type of causality distinguishes the trajectory interpretation from the Copenhagen interpretation. We investigate a perturbing impulse acting on a particle in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. First-order perturbation calculations for the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations predict different results for the change in energy. A perturbing impulse acts on the particle wherever it is in its trajectory at the instant of impulse. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the perturbing impulse acts upon the Schr¨dinger wave function as it is described at the instant of impulse. o There exists a quantum operator, the Hamiltonian, for making the Copenhagen prediction regarding energy. We recognize that the Copenhagen interpretation epistemologically restricts in principle what can be measured. We structure this investigation to address those concerns of the Copenhagen school. While the trajectory is completely determined by a necessary and sufficient set of initial conditions,7,10 we may relax our knowledge of initial conditions to satisfy Copenhagen epistemology and still show different predictions. This renders a counter example where a strong causal theory, the trajectory representation, can predict something new and different from the Copenhagen interpretation even with Copenhagen epistemology. An investigation of the particle's energy during perturbation is sufficient to establish this counter example. We study a perturbing potential that has an impulse in time described by a -function and that is spatial symmetric, linear and limited to a small but finite domain of the square well. This perturbing potential has been chosen for five reasons. First, it accentuates the difference in the temporal behavior of energy for the two representations. Second, first-order perturbation theory suffices for exhibiting differences between the two representations. Third, the physics of how this perturbation temporally effects energy is easily understood. Fourth, we can spatially confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of the nodes of the ground state (at the well's edge) of the infinitely deep square well while we concurrently confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of nodes of latent excited states. This ensures that all perturbation matrix elements will be small. And fifth, it is mathematically tractable as our computations use algebraic expressions or elementary functions. Where necessary, approximations can be done by reasonable algebraic expressions that do not lose any physics. We make it explicit that the trajectory representation considered herein differs with pilot-wave representations. They have different equations of motion. The trajectory representation does not invoke a -field. The equations of motion for the trajectory representation are determined by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation while Bohmian mechanics5 assumes that the conjugate momentum should be the mechanical momentum. This leads to different results that have been discussed elsewhere.6 For a bound state of the square well, Bohmian mechanics predicts that the bound particle always stands still.11 We also note that the trajectories consider here are different from the trajectories for the Feynman representation. The Feynman representation uses a classical generator of the motion as its propagator12 while the trajectory representation uses a generalized Hamilton's characteristic function as its generator of the motion.6-8 The trajectory representation and the Schr¨dinger representation without the Copenhagen interpretation o mutually imply each other.8 The Born postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation assigns a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function. Lest we forget, Schr¨dinger opposed the Copenhagen interpretation o o of his wave function. Nothing herein implies that time-dependent perturbation theory for a trajectory representation is easier than that for contemporary wave mechanics. It is much more difficult. It is even more difficult in general than classical canonical perturbation theory. But then, we ask so much more from trajectory perturbations. 2

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the trajectory representation of a particle in an infinitely deep square well in the unperturbed state. Section 3 addresses the differences between the time-dependent perturbation of energy for the two representations. Section 4 describes how the investigation is structured to comply with Copenhagen epistemology. A brief discussion is given in Section 5 regarding our findings for ensemble averages and any subsequent experimental verification.

BEFORE PERTURBATION

Unperturbed System: Let us consider initially that a particle is in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well whose (unperturbed) potential is given by V (x) = , 0, |x| > q |x|  q (1)

where q is finite positive. The trajectory representation is based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. The timeindependent generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics for a particle is given for onedimensional motion in the x-direction by7-9,13 h ¯2 (W/x)2 +V -E =- W;x (2) 2m 4m where W/x is conjugate momentum, E is the energy for the particle, m is mass of the particle, and h ¯ = h/(2) where in turn h is Planck's constant. The term W ; x in Eq. (2) is the Schwarzian derivative of Hamilton's characteristic function, W , with respect to x. The Schwarzian derivative is given by W;x = 3  3 W/x3 - W/x 2  2 W/x2 W/x
2

.

The left side of Eq. (2) manifests the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation while the Schwarzian derivative on the right side manifests the higher order quantum effects. The general solution for W/x is given by7,8 W/x = ±(2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1 (3)

where (a, b, c) is a set of real coefficients such that a, b > 0, and (, ) is a set of normalized independent solutions of the associated time-independent one-dimensional Schr¨dinger equation, o -¯ 2 d2  h + (V - E) = 0 2m dx2 where  is the Schr¨dinger wave function. The independent solutions (, ) are normalized so that their o Wronskian, W(, ) =  d/dx - d/dx , is scaled to give W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)] > 0. (The h nonlinearity of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation induces this normalization upon W .8 ) This ensures that (a2 + b2 + c) > 0. We note for completeness that a particular set (, ) of independent solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation may be chosen by the superposition principle so that the coefficient c is zero. o The motion in phase space is specified by Eq. (3). This phase-space trajectory is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The ± sign in Eq. (3) designates that the motion may be in either x-direction. The corresponding solution for the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, W , is given by7,8 W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 +K (4)

where K is an integration constant, which we may set to zero herein.

The unperturbed energy, E, and action variable, J, for the ground state are quantized by E = h2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = ¯ J /(32mq 2 ). The relationship between E and J is consistent with classical mechanics where Eclassical = J 2 /(32mq 2 ). The quantization of E and J are independent of the coefficients a, b and c.7 Subsequently, the wave number for the ground state is specified to be k = /(2q). The set of independent solutions (, ) for this unperturbed square well is chosen such that  represents the symmetric bound state given by

where V   manifests an infinitely deep square well, where E is a function of V given implicitly by the quantizing equation E 1/2 = h(2m)-1/2 q -1 arctan{[(V - E)/E]1/2 } for the finite square well, and where  is ¯ a function of V given by  = [2m(V - E)]1/2 /¯ . [Note that limV E  ¯ 2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = E.] The other h h solution, , is unbound and is not unique as any amount of  may be added to it. While  represents the symmetric bound state, the corresponding  that we have chosen is antisymmetric. We present this unbound solution as  1/2 E V  lim  x>q cosh[(x - q)] - V exp[(x - q)]  ,   V V-E 1/4  2m sin(kx), -q  x  q = ·  h ¯ 2 k 2 (ab - c2 /4)   1/2  V  lim x < -q. - cosh[(x + q)] + E exp[(x + q)]  -,

Microstates: For bound states in general and the ground state in particular, microstates of the Schr¨dinger o wave function exist where the particular choice of the set of coefficients (a, b, c) specifies a unique trajectory in phase space for a given quantized energy E or quantized action variable J as developed elsewhere.8 Each microstate is consistent with the bound-state Schr¨dinger wave function for the bound state can also be o expressed by7,8 (2m)1/4 cos(W/¯ ) h 2 /(4b)]1/2 (W/x)1/2 [a - c (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 cos arctan [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 = . (6)

We have retained the limiting process as an intermediate step in describing  and  in the classically forbidden region, |x| > q, to facilitate evaluating the Wronskian there. The corresponding Wronskian gives W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 everywhere as expected. The (unperturbed) ground state Schr¨dinger h o wave function is well known to be  x>q  0,   (5) = q -1/2 cos(kx), -q  x  q    0, x < -q.

Thus, before the perturbing impulse acts on the particle, each microstate of the ground state has the same quantized energy as the Schr¨dinger wave function. o Hamilton's characteristic function is a generator of motion. The equation of motion in the domain [x, t] is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for a constant coordinate (often called Jacobi's 4

theorem). The procedure simplifies for coordinates whose conjugate momenta are separation constants. For stationarity, E is a separation constant for time. Thus, the equation of motion for the trajectory time, t, relative to its constant coordinate  , is given as a function of x by t -  = W/E (7)

where the trajectory for a given energy, E, is a function of a set of coefficients (a, b, c) and  specifies the epoch. We see that a Hamilton-Jacobi development of the trajectory representation does not return us to the classical representation because we must consider microstates, which do not occur in an infinitely deep, classical square well. The trajectory associated with a microstate of given energy E may be specified by the set of coefficients (a, b, c) or by the set of initial conditions (xo , xo , xo ).7 On the other hand, classical motion  ¨ in one dimension is simpler for it is specified for a given E by the initial condition xo . Nevertheless, the particular microstate, a = b and c = 0, does correspond to the contemporary concept of classical motion.

DURING PERTURBATION

Perturbing System: Let us now apply a spatially dependent impulse at time  to the quantum particle in the ground state. The impulse is spatially dependent and, where occurring, is toward the center of the well. The subsequent time-dependent perturbing potential, F V (x, t), is a spatially dependent impulse, which is symmetric, given by  |x| > q or |x|  q -   0,   (-x - q + ), -q  x < -q +  F V (x, t) = (t - )F · (8)    (x - q + ), q-<xq

where F is a factor with units of force and where 0 <   q. The spatial dependence of V is intentionally symmetric to simplify our investigation. Let us now calculate the first-order changes in energy induced by F V (x, t). We compare the calculated changes both for a Copenhagen interpretation based upon the standard time-dependent perturbation theory for the Schr¨dinger representation and for a trajectory representation based upon a canonical, generalized o Hamilton-Jacobi perturbation theory. Both theories are based upon variation of parameters. Different firstorder predictions in E are exhibited for the two perturbation methods. First-order changes in E are sufficient for our comparison because we are free to make  and F as small as necessary. We first apply the standard wave-function time-dependent perturbation theory. The variation in the coefficient (parameter) of the ground state, C0 (the coefficient of the eigenfunction that, by itself, specified the particle before time ) is well known and given by i¯ C0 = F (V )00 C0 + O(F 2 ) h

where (V )00 = 0|V |0 = cos(2k) 1 2 - 2+ 2 4k 4k 2

Thus, C0 varies to first order in F . Therefore, as is well known, the complex behavior of C0 (t), to first order in F , changes in angular frequency due to a finite (V )00 . Ergo, the first-order change in energy, E1 of an ensemble of particles to first order in F is given by E1 = F (V )00 = F cos(2k) 1 2 . - 2+ 2 4k 4k 2 (9)

We now apply a canonical perturbation expansion, based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi theory to the trajectory representation. To do this, we allow the parameters E and  , which were constants of the motion in the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq. (7), to be varied as a function of time by the perturbation. (Energy is no longer a separation constant for a time-dependent Hamiltonian; consequently, the "constant coordinate",  , is also no longer a constant coordinate.) We expand E and  in a power series in F . As we are only interested in the first order term of energy, we shall compute this term only. The generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (2) manifests the same canonical transformation that generates the classical Hamilton-Jacobi transformation.14 Hence, the equations of motion for the variables (E,  ) for the trajectory representation are the same as those for classical perturbation theory. These well known equations of motion are given by  E = F V (E, , t)/ and  = -F V (E, , t)/E. 

If the perturbation is small [we are free to make (F, ) as small as required], then we can produce a first-order approximation (E1 , 1 ) to the time variation of (E,  ) by using the constant, unperturbed values (E0 , 0 ) on the right sides of the above equations. For the perturbation expansion of interest (the expansion of E), we must solve  E1 = -F V (E0 , 0 , t)/0 . (10)

In solving the above equations for our perturbation, which is not an explicit function of momentum, we must express x in V as a function of (E, , t). This requires us to turn the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq. (7), inside out. Reversion of t(x) to x(t): The unperturbed equation of motion is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation, Eq. (7), which renders t- = ±2 mx (ab - c2 /4)1/2 hk ¯ a + b + (a - b) cos(2kx) + c sin(2kx) (11)

where the ± sign indicates that motion may be in either direction. The trajectory is dependent upon the coefficients (a, b, c), which specify the particular microstate. If a = b or c = 0, then Eq. (11) is a transcendental equation that cannot be turned inside out to solve for x in closed form. But the spatial dependence of V (x, t) is non-zero only over two small regions: -q  x < -q +  and q -  < x  q. In these two regions we may expand the trigonometric functions in a Maclaurin series about -q and q respectfully. For example, we may express Eq. (11) for a particle traveling in the +x-direction in the domain -q  x < -q +  as t- = - c2 /4)1/2 + O[(x + q)3 ], 0  x + q    1. b - ck(x + q) + (a - b)k 2 (x + q)2

(12)

In Eq. (12), keeping the Maclaurin series expansion of the trigonometric functions only up to second order still captures the physical nuances of the microstates as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c) (again,  may be made as small as necessary). If we ignore the O[(x + q)3 ] terms in Eq. (12), we may now turn the equation of motion inside out to approximate (x + q) as a quadratic solution to Eq. (12). An approximate (x + q) as a function of (E, , t) may be given for a particle traveling in the +x-direction as

where G = b/(ab - c2 /4)1/2 . While we use G to make Eq. (13) less cumbersome, we note that G is a constant of the motion in its own right. This follows for G can be expressed entirely by other constants of the motion 6

and other physical constants. We have G = (2m)1/2 I/(¯ W) where W is, as previously given, the Wronskian h for the set of independent solutions (, ) and I is the Ermakov invariant given by13 I = [a - c2 /(4b)]-1 . For completeness, the constant of the motion G by Eq. (12) can be related to the periodicity of the microstate by G= h ¯k m 4q tperiod

where tperiod is the duration of a single cycle in phase space of the microstate. Perturbation Effects: We may now formulate V (E0 , 0 , t) for a particle traveling in the +x-direction in the domain -q  x < -q +  from Eqs. (8) and (13) as

where the "T " in "T bF " in the above is a unit measure in time. This "T " manifests that -function impulse has been integrated over a time domain that includes the instant that the -function acts. If the particle is between -q and -q +  at time , then the particle and the system causing the perturbing force will transfer energy between each other. The amount of energy transferred to first order in F is given by the magnitude of E1 . The direction of transfer is given by the sign of E1 . From Eq. (15), E1 is a function of the particular microstate as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c). The energy for the particle is E = E0 + E1 + O(F 2 ). Let us simplify E1 by considering the particular microstate where the coefficients are specified by a = b and c = 0. Then, Eq. (13) becomes exact, and Eq.

where the particle does work on the perturbing system by transferring to first order the energy E1 to it. Now we consider the effect of the perturbation upon a particle travelling in the -x-direction. We arbitrarily assume that the cycle of interest is one for which particle motion in the +x-direction occurs first. When the particle reflects at the well boundary x = q, the trajectory in phase space rounds a singular point and jumps from the Riemann sheet for +x motion for that cycle to the Riemann sheet for -x motion for that cycle. Innate to this jumping of Riemann sheets is a shift in the epoch  . As t x=q must be the same for both Riemann sheets, we have from Eq.

But we note that the first order E1 is zero here for any microstate of the trajectory representation because the particle is not located in a space-time location where the perturbation acts. Under the trajectory interpretation, we do know where the particle is in trajectory theory: the trajectory representation is strongly causal. The time dependence of the perturbing system is a -function. Ergo, we can predict individual results, E1 , in trajectory theory by Eqs. (15) and (17)­ (20). These trajectory predictions for E1 differ with the predictions, Eq. (9), of the Copenhagen interpretation that are based upon ensemble averages! Furthermore, the trajectory predictions are a function of the particular microstate.

COPENHAGEN EPISTEMOLOGY

Copenhagen epistemology rejects in principle sufficient knowledge of the initial conditions to specify an individual trajectory (microstate). The Copenhagen school denies strong causality for describing a particle's progress along a trajectory but rather limits causality to the evolution of . Fortunately, complete knowledge of the initial conditions attendant with strong causality, although sufficient, is not necessary to show differences. We are free to apply a trajectory analysis with incomplete information. For the sake of this investigation, we shall assume that we do not know the necessary and sufficient initial conditions and that we must use ensemble averages. Even with ensemble averages, we may still show that the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations predict different first-order perturbation energies. Had we not known the particle's position at time  due to some practical limitation and, consistent with the trajectory interpretation, not due to some limitation in principle, then if we assume a uniform distribution of  over the duration of one cycle, the average E1 as determined by Eqs. (15) and (17)­(20), would be given by E1 average = 0. Lest we forget, each microstate (trajectory) by itself is sufficient to deduce . Physically, averaging E1 for a uniform distribution of  manifests that, to first order, the perturbing system is as likely to do work on the particle as the particle is likely to do work on the perturbing system. We do not need to know the microstate of any particular particle of the ensemble. It is sufficient that the ensemble be large enough so that the sub-ensemble for each microstate would tend, with increasing sub-ensemble size, toward a relative balance between particles going in each direction along the x-axis. This relative balance is so because each microstate's orbit in phase space has mirror symmetry about the configuration x-axis in accordance with Eq. (3). Hence, we may generalize our findings to any distribution of microstates so long as the sub-ensemble of each microstate is sufficiently large. In such case, we still have that E1 average = 0 for the trajectory interpretation while the Copenhagen interpretation finds that E1 is finite as given by Eq. (9). One is cautioned not to infer from E1 average = 0 in the preceding paragraph for a uniform distribution of  that the expectation value of E1 in the trajectory representation would be given to first order by the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated in the unperturbed state. For perturbations of long duration, E1 in contemporary quantum mechanics is given to first order by the expectation value of the perturbing potential in the unperturbed state, which in classical mechanics corresponds to the time average of the perturbation evaluated in the unperturbed system.15 But we have here an impulsive perturbation. Even for classical mechanics, E1 average , as generated by an impulsive perturbation with a uniform distribution of  , would be zero and is not equivalent to the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated in the unperturbed system. Thus, classical mechanics offers a precedent for impulsive perturbation. Usually, the orbital period is assumed to be shorter than the duration of the perturbation in classical systems. As noted in the preceding paragraph, this assumptions would allow us to simplify by averaging over the orbit. But we consider here the reverse situation with an impulsive perturbation. Immaterial of how much we know, what happens by strong causality is determined by the particle's position at the time of the perturbing impulse and what it is doing then [i.e., x(), x() and x()] as described by a particular  ¨ microstate of the unperturbed energy. These initial conditions are more extensive then those needed for 9

classical perturbation theory. In classical mechanics, the unperturbed energy, the applicable Riemann sheet of Wclassical and the particle's position, x(), at the time of perturbing impulse suffice for classical causality.

DISCUSSION

The predictions for an ensemble average E1 of the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations differ. In this ensemble, we need not know the distribution of microstates nor the exact distribution of the constant coordinate,  . Hence, this comparison of ensemble averages between the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretation complies with Copenhagen epistemology. The underlying reason for the difference in the predictions between the Copenhagen interpretation and the trajectory representation is due to their difference regarding causality. The trajectory interpretation is strongly causal for individual trajectories while the Copenhagen interpretation is weakly causal for ensembles while only giving probabilities for individual events. Any subsequent experimental verification of our results is actually a test of which causality quantum mechanics observes. The particular problem that we have examined here was chosen to simplify the mathematics in our exposition. We need not be constrained to such ideal conditions in any experimental verification. We do advise that the duration of any perturbation be much shorter than the orbital period of the test particle. (Had we examined a small perturbation of long duration relative to the particles orbital period, then the perturbing potential would produce a change in energy given by the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated by the unperturbed system which would correspond to the expected first-order change in energy in wave mechanics.15 ) A perturbation of very short duration with spatial dependence would generate predictions that accentuate the different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations.

Which Causality? Differences between Trajectory and Copenhagen Analyses of an Impulsive Perturbation
Edward R. Floyd 10 Jamaica Village Road, Coronado, California 92118-3208, USA floyd@sd.cts.com February 1, 2008
Abstract The trajectory and Copenhagen representations render different predictions for impulsive perturbations. The different predictions are due to the different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations. We investigate a small perturbing impulse acting on the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. For the two representations, the first-order perturbation calculations for the temporal change in energy differ. This temporal change in energy for the trajectory representation is dependent upon the microstate of the wave function. We show that even under Copenhagen epistemology, the two representations predict different theoretical results.

INTRODUCTION

The trajectory interpretation has strong causality by precept. Bohr, the chief founder of the Copenhagen interpretation, held that causality had to be dropped for a consistent quantum theory.1 Born, another founder of the Copenhagen interpretation, asserted "in the quantum theory it is the principle of causality, or more accurately that of determination, which must be dropped" (emphases in original).2 More recent champions of the Copenhagen interpretation have construed "causality" to be the temporal evolution of the Schr¨dinger wave function with time.3,4 (We shall use herein this evolved usage of "causality" with regard o to the Copenhagen interpretation.) This causality for the Copenhagen interpretation is a weak causality. The different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations are fundamental and manifest different theoretical predictions. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics has been consistent with observations of large ensembles. But it only renders a probability of outcomes for individual events. Heretofore, the mainstream of physics has considered strong causal theories of quantum mechanics to be only alternative representations that rendered nothing new and, likewise, only predicted probabilities for outcomes. For example, Bohm's stochastic causal theory of quantum mechanics, which purports to be consistent with the probability amplitude of the wave function, introduces chance by precept.5 On the other hand, the trajectory representation is not based upon chance.6-8 The trajectory itself is strongly causal and deterministic. The trajectory representation has shown that the Born postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation, which attributes a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function, is o 1

unnecessary.9 The trajectory representation has shown that the Schr¨dinger wave function of the Copenhagen o interpretation is not an exhaustive description of quantum phenomenon because the trajectory representation distinguishes microstates, each specifying a distinct trajectory, of the wave function.6-8 Each trajectory or microstate is sufficient by itself to specify the Schr¨dinger wave function.7 We need not invoke an ensemble o of trajectories to get the Schr¨dinger wave function. The trajectory representation renders deterministic o predictions for an individual particle viz-a-viz the probability predictions of the Copenhagen representation for an ensemble of particles.9 Herein, we investigate a situation where the type of causality distinguishes the trajectory interpretation from the Copenhagen interpretation. We investigate a perturbing impulse acting on a particle in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well. First-order perturbation calculations for the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations predict different results for the change in energy. A perturbing impulse acts on the particle wherever it is in its trajectory at the instant of impulse. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the perturbing impulse acts upon the Schr¨dinger wave function as it is described at the instant of impulse. o There exists a quantum operator, the Hamiltonian, for making the Copenhagen prediction regarding energy. We recognize that the Copenhagen interpretation epistemologically restricts in principle what can be measured. We structure this investigation to address those concerns of the Copenhagen school. While the trajectory is completely determined by a necessary and sufficient set of initial conditions,7,10 we may relax our knowledge of initial conditions to satisfy Copenhagen epistemology and still show different predictions. This renders a counter example where a strong causal theory, the trajectory representation, can predict something new and different from the Copenhagen interpretation even with Copenhagen epistemology. An investigation of the particle's energy during perturbation is sufficient to establish this counter example. We study a perturbing potential that has an impulse in time described by a -function and that is spatial symmetric, linear and limited to a small but finite domain of the square well. This perturbing potential has been chosen for five reasons. First, it accentuates the difference in the temporal behavior of energy for the two representations. Second, first-order perturbation theory suffices for exhibiting differences between the two representations. Third, the physics of how this perturbation temporally effects energy is easily understood. Fourth, we can spatially confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of the nodes of the ground state (at the well's edge) of the infinitely deep square well while we concurrently confine the perturbation to the neighborhood of nodes of latent excited states. This ensures that all perturbation matrix elements will be small. And fifth, it is mathematically tractable as our computations use algebraic expressions or elementary functions. Where necessary, approximations can be done by reasonable algebraic expressions that do not lose any physics. We make it explicit that the trajectory representation considered herein differs with pilot-wave representations. They have different equations of motion. The trajectory representation does not invoke a -field. The equations of motion for the trajectory representation are determined by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation while Bohmian mechanics5 assumes that the conjugate momentum should be the mechanical momentum. This leads to different results that have been discussed elsewhere.6 For a bound state of the square well, Bohmian mechanics predicts that the bound particle always stands still.11 We also note that the trajectories consider here are different from the trajectories for the Feynman representation. The Feynman representation uses a classical generator of the motion as its propagator12 while the trajectory representation uses a generalized Hamilton's characteristic function as its generator of the motion.6-8 The trajectory representation and the Schr¨dinger representation without the Copenhagen interpretation o mutually imply each other.8 The Born postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation assigns a probability amplitude to the Schr¨dinger wave function. Lest we forget, Schr¨dinger opposed the Copenhagen interpretation o o of his wave function. Nothing herein implies that time-dependent perturbation theory for a trajectory representation is easier than that for contemporary wave mechanics. It is much more difficult. It is even more difficult in general than classical canonical perturbation theory. But then, we ask so much more from trajectory perturbations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the trajectory representation of a particle in an infinitely deep square well in the unperturbed state. Section 3 addresses the differences between the time-dependent perturbation of energy for the two representations. Section 4 describes how the investigation 2

is structured to comply with Copenhagen epistemology. A brief discussion is given in Section 5 regarding our findings for ensemble averages and any subsequent experimental verification.

BEFORE PERTURBATION

Unperturbed System: Let us consider initially that a particle is in the ground state of an infinitely deep square well whose (unperturbed) potential is given by V (x) = , 0, |x| > q |x|  q (1)

where q is finite positive. The trajectory representation is based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. The timeindependent generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation for quantum mechanics for a particle is given for onedimensional motion in the x-direction by7-9,13 h ¯2 (W/x)2 +V -E =- W;x (2) 2m 4m where W/x is conjugate momentum, E is the energy for the particle, m is mass of the particle, and h ¯ = h/(2) where in turn h is Planck's constant. The term W ; x in Eq. (2) is the Schwarzian derivative of Hamilton's characteristic function, W , with respect to x. The Schwarzian derivative is given by 3  3 W/x3 - W;x = W/x 2  2 W/x2 W/x
2

.

The left side of Eq. (2) manifests the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation while the Schwarzian derivative on the right side manifests the higher order quantum effects. The general solution for W/x is given by7,8 W/x = ±(2m)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)-1 (3)

where (a, b, c) is a set of real coefficients such that a, b > 0, and (, ) is a set of normalized independent solutions of the associated time-independent one-dimensional Schr¨dinger equation, o -¯ 2 d2  h + (V - E) = 0 2m dx2 where  is the Schr¨dinger wave function. The independent solutions (, ) are normalized so that their o Wronskian, W(, ) =  d/dx - d/dx , is scaled to give W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)] > 0. (The h nonlinearity of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation induces this normalization upon W .8 ) This ensures that (a2 + b2 + c) > 0. We note for completeness that a particular set (, ) of independent solutions of the Schr¨dinger equation may be chosen by the superposition principle so that the coefficient c is zero. o The motion in phase space is specified by Eq. (3). This phase-space trajectory is a function of the set of coefficients (a, b, c). The ± sign in Eq. (3) designates that the motion may be in either x-direction. The corresponding solution for the generalized Hamilton's characteristic function, W , is given by7,8 W = h arctan ¯ b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 +K (4)

where K is an integration constant, which we may set to zero herein. The unperturbed energy, E, and action variable, J, for the ground state are quantized by E = h2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = ¯ 2 J /(32mq 2 ). The relationship between E and J is consistent with classical mechanics where Eclassical = J 2 /(32mq 2 ). The quantization of E and J are independent of the coefficients a, b and c.7 Subsequently, the wave number for the ground state is specified to be k = /(2q). 3

where V   manifests an infinitely deep square well, where E is a function of V given implicitly by the quantizing equation E 1/2 = h(2m)-1/2 q -1 arctan{[(V - E)/E]1/2 } for the finite square well, and where  is ¯ a function of V given by  = [2m(V - E)]1/2 /¯ . [Note that limV E  ¯ 2  2 /(8mq 2 ) = E.] The other h h solution, , is unbound and is not unique as any amount of  may be added to it. While  represents the symmetric bound state, the corresponding  that we have chosen is antisymmetric. We present this unbound solution as  1/2 E V  lim  x>q cosh[(x - q)] - V exp[(x - q)]  ,  V V-E  1/4  2m sin(kx), -q  x  q · =  h ¯ 2 k 2 (ab - c2 /4)   1/2  V  lim x < -q. - cosh[(x + q)] + E exp[(x + q)]  -,
V V-E V

The set of independent solutions (, ) for this unperturbed square well is chosen such that  represents the symmetric bound state given by  1/2 x>q  lim (E/V) exp[-(x - q)]  0,  1/4  V 2m cos(kx), -q  x  q = ·  h ¯ 2 k 2 (ab - c2 /4)   lim (E/V)1/2 exp[(x + q)]  0, x < -q
V

We have retained the limiting process as an intermediate step in describing  and  in the classically forbidden region, |x| > q, to facilitate evaluating the Wronskian there. The corresponding Wronskian gives W 2 (, ) = 2m/[¯ 2 (ab - c2 /4)]  0 everywhere as expected. The (unperturbed) ground state Schr¨dinger h o wave function is well known to be  x>q  0,   = (5) q -1/2 cos(kx), -q  x  q    0, x < -q.

Microstates: For bound states in general and the ground state in particular, microstates of the Schr¨dinger o wave function exist where the particular choice of the set of coefficients (a, b, c) specifies a unique trajectory in phase space for a given quantized energy E or quantized action variable J as developed elsewhere.8 Each microstate is consistent with the bound-state Schr¨dinger wave function for the bound state can also be o expressed by7,8 (2m)1/4 cos(W/¯ ) h [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 (W/x)1/2 (a2 + b2 + c)1/2 cos arctan [a - c2 /(4b)]1/2 b(/) + c/2 (ab - c2 /4)1/2 = . (6)



=

=

Thus, before the perturbing impulse acts on the particle, each microstate of the ground state has the same quantized energy as the Schr¨dinger wave function. o Hamilton's characteristic function is a generator of motion. The equation of motion in the domain [x, t] is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation for a constant coordinate (often called Jacobi's theorem). The procedure simplifies for coordinates whose conjugate momenta are separation constants. For stationarity, E is a separation constant for time. Thus, the equation of motion for the trajectory time, t, relative to its constant coordinate  , is given as a function of x by t -  = W/E 4 (7)

where the trajectory for a given energy, E, is a function of a set of coefficients (a, b, c) and  specifies the epoch. We see that a Hamilton-Jacobi development of the trajectory representation does not return us to the classical representation because we must consider microstates, which do not occur in an infinitely deep, classical square well. The trajectory associated with a microstate of given energy E may be specified by the set of coefficients (a, b, c) or by the set of initial conditions (xo , xo , xo ).7 On the other hand, classical motion  ¨ in one dimension is simpler for it is specified for a given E by the initial condition xo . Nevertheless, the particular microstate, a = b and c = 0, does correspond to the contemporary concept of classical motion.

3

DURING PERTURBATION

Perturbing System: Let us now apply a spatially dependent impulse at time  to the quantum particle in the ground state. The impulse is spatially dependent and, where occurring, is toward the center of the well. The subsequent time-dependent perturbing potential, F V (x, t), is a spatially dependent impulse, which is symmetric, given by  |x| > q or |x|  q -   0,   F V (x, t) = (t - )F · (-x - q + ), -q  x < -q +  (8)    (x - q + ), q-<xq

where F is a factor with units of force and where 0 <   q. The spatial dependence of V is intentionally symmetric to simplify our investigation. Let us now calculate the first-order changes in energy induced by F V (x, t). We compare the calculated changes both for a Copenhagen interpretation based upon the standard time-dependent perturbation theory for the Schr¨dinger representation and for a trajectory representation based upon a canonical, generalized o Hamilton-Jacobi perturbation theory. Both theories are based upon variation of parameters. Different firstorder predictions in E are exhibited for the two perturbation methods. First-order changes in E are sufficient for our comparison because we are free to make  and F as small as necessary. We first apply the standard wave-function time-dependent perturbation theory. The variation in the coefficient (parameter) of the ground state, C0 (the coefficient of the eigenfunction that, by itself, specified the particle before time ) is well known and given by i¯ C0 = F (V )00 C0 + O(F 2 ) h

where (V )00 = 0|V |0 = cos(2k) 1 2 - 2+ 2 4k 4k 2

Thus, C0 varies to first order in F . Therefore, as is well known, the complex behavior of C0 (t), to first order in F , changes in angular frequency due to a finite (V )00 . Ergo, the first-order change in energy, E1 of an ensemble of particles to first order in F is given by E1 = F (V )00 = F 2 cos(2k) 1 . - 2+ 2 4k 4k 2 (9)

We now apply a canonical perturbation expansion, based upon a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi theory to the trajectory representation. To do this, we allow the parameters E and  , which were constants of the motion in the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq. (7), to be varied as a function of time by the perturbation. (Energy is no longer a separation constant for a time-dependent Hamiltonian; consequently, the "constant coordinate",  , is also no longer a constant coordinate.) We expand E and  in a power series in F . As we are only interested in the first order term of energy, we shall compute this term only. 5

The generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation, Eq. (2) manifests the same canonical transformation that generates the classical Hamilton-Jacobi transformation.14 Hence, the equations of motion for the variables (E,  ) for the trajectory representation are the same as those for classical perturbation theory. These well known equations of motion are given by  E = F V (E, , t)/ and  = -F V (E, , t)/E. 

If the perturbation is small [we are free to make (F, ) as small as required], then we can produce a first-order approximation (E1 , 1 ) to the time variation of (E,  ) by using the constant, unperturbed values (E0 , 0 ) on the right sides of the above equations. For the perturbation expansion of interest (the expansion of E), we must solve  E1 = -F V (E0 , 0 , t)/0 . (10)

In solving the above equations for our perturbation, which is not an explicit function of momentum, we must express x in V as a function of (E, , t). This requires us to turn the unperturbed equation of motion, Eq. (7), inside out. Reversion of t(x) to x(t): The unperturbed equation of motion is given by the Hamilton-Jacobi transformation equation, Eq. (7), which renders t- = ±2 mx (ab - c2 /4)1/2 hk ¯ a + b + (a - b) cos(2kx) + c sin(2kx) (11)

where the ± sign indicates that motion may be in either direction. The trajectory is dependent upon the coefficients (a, b, c), which specify the particular microstate. If a = b or c = 0, then Eq. (11) is a transcendental equation that cannot be turned inside out to solve for x in closed form. But the spatial dependence of V (x, t) is non-zero only over two small regions: -q  x < -q +  and q -  < x  q. In these two regions we may expand the trigonometric functions in a Maclaurin series about -q and q respectfully. For example, we may express Eq. (11) for a particle traveling in the +x-direction in the domain -q  x < -q +  as t- = - c2 /4)1/2 + O[(x + q)3 ], 0  x + q    1. b - ck(x + q) + (a - b)k 2 (x + q)2
mx hk (ab ¯

(12)

In Eq. (12), keeping the Maclaurin series expansion of the trigonometric functions only up to second order still captures the physical nuances of the microstates as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c) (again,  may be made as small as necessary). If we ignore the O[(x + q)3 ] terms in Eq. (12), we may now turn the equation of motion inside out to approximate (x + q) as a quadratic solution to Eq. (12). An approximate (x + q) as a function of (E, , t) may be given for a particle traveling in the +x-direction as

where G = b/(ab - c2 /4)1/2 . While we use G to make Eq. (13) less cumbersome, we note that G is a constant of the motion in its own right. This follows for G can be expressed entirely by other constants of the motion and other physical constants. We have G = (2m)1/2 I/(¯ W) where W is, as previously given, the Wronskian h for the set of independent solutions (, ) and I is the Ermakov invariant given by13 I = [a - c2 /(4b)]-1 .

where the "T " in "T bF " in the above is a unit measure in time. This "T " manifests that -function impulse has been integrated over a time domain that includes the instant that the -function acts. If the particle is between -q and -q +  at time , then the particle and the system causing the perturbing force will transfer energy between each other. The amount of energy transferred to first order in F is given by the magnitude of E1 . The direction of transfer is given by the sign of E1 . From Eq. (15), E1 is a function of the particular microstate as specified by the coefficients (a, b, c). The energy for the particle is E = E0 + E1 + O(F 2 ). Let us simplify E1 by considering the particular microstate where the coefficients are specified by a = b and c = 0. Then, Eq. (13) becomes exact, and Eq. (15) becomes exactly E1 = +F h ¯k T, m mq m(q - ) <  - 0  - . h ¯k h ¯k (16)

a=b,c=0

This simplified case has an intuitive physical interpretation. We see from the plus sign on the right side of Eq. (16) that the perturbing system does work on the particle by transferring to first order the energy E1 to it. The amount of energy is proportional to the force factor, F , and the distance that the particle transits against this force during the perturbation's duration. The transit distance for a = b and c = 0 is given by the product of particle velocity, hk/m, and one unit of time denoted by "T " in Eq. (16). This is also what ¯ we would intuitively expect from classical perturbation theory and is a manifestation that the trajectory representation is strongly causal. 7

where the particle does work on the perturbing system by transferring to first order the energy E1 to it. Now we consider the effect of the perturbation upon a particle travelling in the -x-direction. We arbitrarily assume that the cycle of interest is one for which particle motion in the +x-direction occurs first. When the particle reflects at the well boundary x = q, the trajectory in phase space rounds a singular point and jumps from the Riemann sheet for +x motion for that cycle to the Riemann sheet for -x motion for that cycle. Innate to this jumping of Riemann sheets is a shift in the epoch  . As t x=q must be the same for both Riemann sheets, we have from Eq. (7) that - = + + 2mq/(¯ kG) where the subscript of  denotes h the direction of motion. Unless needed, the sign subscript for  will not be made explicit.

But we note that the first order E1 is zero here for any microstate of the trajectory representation because the particle is not located in a space-time location where the perturbation acts. Under the trajectory interpretation, we do know where the particle is in trajectory theory: the trajectory representation is strongly causal. The time dependence of the perturbing system is a -function. Ergo, we can predict individual results, E1 , in trajectory theory by Eqs. (15) and (17)­ (20). These trajectory predictions for E1 differ with the predictions, Eq. (9), of the Copenhagen interpretation that are based upon ensemble averages! Furthermore, the trajectory predictions are a function of the particular microstate.

COPENHAGEN EPISTEMOLOGY

Copenhagen epistemology rejects in principle sufficient knowledge of the initial conditions to specify an individual trajectory (microstate). The Copenhagen school denies strong causality for describing a particle's progress along a trajectory but rather limits causality to the evolution of . Fortunately, complete knowledge of the initial conditions attendant with strong causality, although sufficient, is not necessary to show differences. We are free to apply a trajectory analysis with incomplete information. For the sake of this investigation, we shall assume that we do not know the necessary and sufficient initial conditions and that we must use ensemble averages. Even with ensemble averages, we may still show that the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations predict different first-order perturbation energies. Had we not known the particle's position at time  due to some practical limitation and, consistent with the trajectory interpretation, not due to some limitation in principle, then if we assume a uniform distribution of  over the duration of one cycle, the average E1 as determined by Eqs. (15) and (17)­(20), would be given by E1 average = 0. Lest we forget, each microstate (trajectory) by itself is sufficient to deduce . Physically, averaging E1 for a uniform distribution of  manifests that, to first order, the perturbing system is as likely to do work on the particle as the particle is likely to do work on the perturbing system. We do not need to know the microstate of any particular particle of the ensemble. It is sufficient that the ensemble be large enough so that the sub-ensemble for each microstate would tend, with increasing sub-ensemble size, toward a relative balance between particles going in each direction along the x-axis. This relative balance is so because each microstate's orbit in phase space has mirror symmetry about the configuration x-axis in accordance with Eq. (3). Hence, we may generalize our findings to any distribution of microstates so long as the sub-ensemble of each microstate is sufficiently large. In such case, we still have that E1 average = 0 for the trajectory interpretation while the Copenhagen interpretation finds that E1 is finite as given by Eq. (9). One is cautioned not to infer from E1 average = 0 in the preceding paragraph for a uniform distribution of  that the expectation value of E1 in the trajectory representation would be given to first order by the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated in the unperturbed state. For perturbations of long duration, E1 in contemporary quantum mechanics is given to first order by the expectation value of the perturbing potential in the unperturbed state, which in classical mechanics corresponds to the time average of the perturbation evaluated in the unperturbed system.15 But we have here an impulsive perturbation. Even for classical mechanics, E1 average , as generated by an impulsive perturbation with a uniform distribution of  , would be zero and is not equivalent to the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated in the unperturbed system. Thus, classical mechanics offers a precedent for impulsive perturbation. Usually, the orbital period is assumed to be shorter than the duration of the perturbation in classical systems. As noted in the preceding paragraph, this assumptions would allow us to simplify by averaging over the orbit. But we consider here the reverse situation with an impulsive perturbation. Immaterial of how much we know, what happens by strong causality is determined by the particle's position at the time of the perturbing impulse and what it is doing then [i.e., x(), x() and x()] as described by a particular  ¨ microstate of the unperturbed energy. These initial conditions are more extensive then those needed for

9

classical perturbation theory. In classical mechanics, the unperturbed energy, the applicable Riemann sheet of Wclassical and the particle's position, x(), at the time of perturbing impulse suffice for classical causality.

5

DISCUSSION

The predictions for an ensemble average E1 of the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations differ. In this ensemble, we need not know the distribution of microstates nor the exact distribution of the constant coordinate,  . Hence, this comparison of ensemble averages between the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretation complies with Copenhagen epistemology. The underlying reason for the difference in the predictions between the Copenhagen interpretation and the trajectory representation is due to their difference regarding causality. The trajectory interpretation is strongly causal for individual trajectories while the Copenhagen interpretation is weakly causal for ensembles while only giving probabilities for individual events. Any subsequent experimental verification of our results is actually a test of which causality quantum mechanics observes. The particular problem that we have examined here was chosen to simplify the mathematics in our exposition. We need not be constrained to such ideal conditions in any experimental verification. We do advise that the duration of any perturbation be much shorter than the orbital period of the test particle. (Had we examined a small perturbation of long duration relative to the particles orbital period, then the perturbing potential would produce a change in energy given by the time average of the perturbing potential evaluated by the unperturbed system which would correspond to the expected first-order change in energy in wave mechanics.15 ) A perturbation of very short duration with spatial dependence would generate predictions that accentuate the different roles that causality plays in the trajectory and Copenhagen interpretations.

Abstract: The evaluation of the matrix element (V )00 is corrected. This correction increases the differences between the trajectory and Copenhagen analyses.

The unnumbered displayed equation preceding Eq. (9) is corrected by including the factor (t -  )/q so that (V )00 becomes1 (V )00 = 0|V |0 = cos(2k) 1 (t - ) 2 - 2+ q 2 4k 4k 2

Consequently, the correct first-order change in energy, E1 , of an ensemble of particles is given by correcting Eq. (9) to read E1 = F (V )00 = F (t - ) 2 cos(2k) 1 . - 2+ q 2 4k 4k 2 (9)

Including this correcting factor (t -  )/q increases the magnitude of E1 during perturbation for the Copenhagen interpretation. Meanwhile, the average E1 of the ensemble of particles for the trajectory representation under Copenhagen epistemology remains E1 average = 0 during perturbation.1 This strengthens our findings that trajectory and Copenhagen analyses differ regarding perturbing impulses.

Abstract The quantization of systems with first- and second-class constraints within the coherentstate path-integral approach is extended to quantum systems with fermionic degrees of freedom. As in the bosonic case the importance of path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers, which in this case are in general expected to be elements of a Grassmann algebra, is explicated. Several examples with first- and second-class constraints are discussed.

Introduction

The quantization of constrained systems has recently been reexamined [1, 2, 3, 4] from the point of view of coherent-state path integrals, which revealed significant differences from the standard operator and path-integral approaches. The aim of this contribution is to extend this approach, formulated for bosonic degrees of freedom, to fermionic systems. That is, we will discuss the generalization of the approach of [1] to constrained quantum systems with fermionic degrees of freedom. As in the bosonic case we will utilize the (fermion) coherent-state path-integral approach. In essence the basic idea of inserting projection operators via proper path-integral measures for Lagrange multipliers is the same as in the bosonic case [1]. Therefore, we will closely follow the approach of [1] and put more emphasize on the presentation of various examples with first- as well as secondclass constraints. We will omit a discussion of the classical version of such systems, that is, the so-called pseudomechanics [5, 6] which is the classical dynamics of Grassmann degrees of freedom. Also the quantization of such systems (without constraints) is well discussed in the literature [7, 6]. Note that due to the Grassmannian nature, the classical dynamics

1

formulated in phase-space always exhibits second-class constraints which, however, can easily be removed [6]. For these reasons we will exclusively concentrate our attention on fermionic quantum systems with operator-valued constraints. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we will review some basic concepts of quantum systems consisting of N fermionic degrees of freedom. In particular, we discuss several properties of fermion coherent states and the associated path-integral approach. In doing so we shall also give a minimal review Grassmann theory. Section 3 is devoted to a general discussion of first-class constraints including a construction method for projection operators following [1]. In Sect. 4 several examples with first-class constraints are discussed. In Sect. 5 we briefly outline the generalization of the treatment of second-class constraints of [1] to fermion systems. Section 6 presents a discussion for a wide range of odd second-class constraints on the basis of typical examples. Finally, in Sect. 7 we consider an example of a constrained boson-fermion system.

2.1

Basic concepts of fermionic degrees of freedom
Grassmann numbers

It is well-known that Grassmann numbers may serve as classical analogues of fermionic degrees of freedom. To be more explicit, the "classical phase space" of N fermions may be identified with the Grassmann algebra CB2N over the field of complex numbers [8, 9], ¯ ¯ which is generated by the set {1 , . . . , N , 1 , . . . , N } of 2N independent Grassmann numbers obeying the anticommutation relations {i , j } := i j + j i = 0 , (1)

¯ {i , j } = 0 ,

¯ ¯ {i , j } = 0 .

This algebra allows for a natural Z2 grading by appointing a degree (also called Grassmann parity) to all homogeneous elements (monomials) of CB2N : ¯ ¯ deg j1 · · · jm i1 · · · in := 0 1 for for m + n even m + n odd . (2)

In other words, the even elements of CB2N are commuting and the odd elements are anticommuting numbers. For further details we refer to the textbooks by Cornwell [8] and Constantinescu and de Groote [9]. Here we close by giving the convention of Grassmann integration and differentiation used in this paper: d 1 = 0 , d  = 1 , d 1=0, d d =1. d (3)

Here  stands for any of the 2N generators of CB2N , and the integration and differentiation operators are treated like odd Grassmann quantities according to the Z2 grading (2).

2.2

Fermion coherent states

Throughout this paper we will consider quantum systems with a finite number, say N , of fermionic degrees of freedom which are characterized by annihilation and creation

2

operators fi and fi , i = 1, 2, . . . , N , obeying the canonical anticommutation relations {fi , fj } = 0 ,
 {fi , fj } = 0 ,

{fi , fj } = ij .

The corresponding Hilbert space is the N -fold tensor product of the two-dimensional Hilbert spaces Hi  C2 for a single degree of freedom, H = H 1  H 2  · · ·  HN = C 2 .

A standard basis in this "N -fermion" Hilbert space H is the simultaneous eigenbasis of the number operators fi fi : fi fi |n1 n2 . . . nN = ni |n1 n2 . . . nN , where |n1 n2 . . . nN := |n1

with |n i being a vector in the one-fermion Hilbert space Hi on which the operators fi and fi are acting via fi |0 i = 0 , fi |1 i = |0 i , (8) fi |0 i = |1 i , fi |1 i = 0 . Fermion coherent states are defined in analogy to the canonical (boson) coherent states [10, 11, 12]. They qualitatively differ, however, from the latter as the basic quantities labeling these states are not ordinary c-numbers but rather are odd Grassmann numbers. To be more precise, they are the generators of the classical phase space CB2N . For simplicity let us consider in the following discussion only one fermionic degree of freedom, that is, we set N = 1 and subscripts will be omitted. Then the fermion coherent states are defined [10, 11, 12] as follows:
 ¯ ¯ | := exp{- 1 }ef  |0 = exp{- 1 } |0 - |1 . 2 2

(9)

The corresponding adjoint states read
1 ¯ ¯ ¯ | := exp{- 1 } 0|ef = exp{- 2 } 0| +  1| . 2 ¯

(10)

The normalized states (9) form an overcomplete set in the one-fermion Hilbert space C2 , that is, 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ 1 |2 = exp{- 1 1 1 } exp{- 2 2 2 } exp{1 2 } 2 (11) ¯ ¯ ¯ = exp{- 1 1 (1 - 2 ) + 1 (1 - 2 )2 }
2 2

and provide a resolution of the identity 1 via ¯ dd | | = = ¯ ¯ ¯ dd |0 0| - |1 0| + |0 1| - 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ dd |0 0| + |1 0| + |0 1| +  1 = 1 . (12)

3

In the above we have already made use of a Z2 grading in analogy to that of Grassmann numbers. That is, we have appointed even and odd Grassmann degrees to the fermion coherent states and the operators [11]: deg(|0 ) = deg(| ) = deg( |) = 0 , deg(|1 ) = deg(f ) = deg(f  ) = 1 , from which follow rules like |0 = |0  , |1 = -|1  , f = -f  , etc. (14) (13)

Finally, we mention that the fermion coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation and creation operators f | = | = |  , ¯ ¯ |f  =  | = | (15)

and as a consequence the coherent-state matrix element of a normal-ordered operator G(f  , f ) = : G(f  , f ) : reads ¯ 1 |G(f  , f )|2 = G(1 , 2 ) 1 |2 . (16)

All of the above properties can trivially be generalized to the case of N > 1 degrees of freedom. In this case the fermion coherent states are essentially the ordered direct product of N one-fermion coherent states [12]. For example, in the case of two degrees of freedom these fermion coherent states read | := |1  |2 = e-·/2 |00 + |10 1 + |01 2 - |11 1 2 , | := 1 |  2 | = e-·/2

¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ 00| + 1 10| + 2 01| - 1 2 11| ,

and we will adopt this obvious generalization throughout this paper.

2.3

Fermion coherent-state path integrals

As in the standard canonical case one can represent the fermion-coherent-state matrix element of the time-evolution operator exp{-itH} in terms of a coherent-state path integral [10, 11, 12]. For convenience we again consider a quantum system with a single degree of freedom which is completely characterized by an even normal-ordered Hamiltonian H = H(f  , f ) = :H(f  , f ): . Hence, the coherent-state matrix element of the evolution operator (or propagator) is given by   |e-itH |  =   |e-iH e-iH · · · e-iH |  (19)

where  := t/N . Inserting the completeness relation (12) N - 1 times and taking the limit   0, that is N   such that N  = t = const., one obtains the time-lattice definition ¯ ¯ ¯ (N :=   , 0 :=   , n := n - n-1 , n := n - n-1 )   |e-itH |  = lim = lim = lim = lim

Similar path-integral expressions may also be derived for other matrix elements of the time-evolution operator [11, 12, 13]. The above path-integral formulation is easily extended to several fermionic [11] and additional bosonic degrees of freedom [13]. The aim of this paper is to find similar path-integral representations of fermion systems subjected to additional constraints. In doing so we will closely follow the idea of [1], which incorporates proper projection operators via some additional path-integral measure for the Lagrange multipliers.

First-class constraints

The quantum systems under consideration are characterized by an even self-adjoint and normal-ordered Hamiltonian   H(f  , f ), where f  and f stand for the set {f1 , . . . , fN } and {f1 , . . . , fN }, respectively. The quantum dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian is assumed to be subjected to constraints characterized by operator-valued normal-ordered functions of the fermionic annihilation and creation operators. Furthermore, we assume that these constraints have a well-defined Grassmann parity. Then, in the general case, we have two sets of constraints. One consists of even operators denoted by a  a (f  , f ) = : a (f  , f ) : =  , a deg a = 0 , (22)

and enumerated by Latin characters a, b, c, . . .. The other one consists of odd constraints, for which we will use the notation    (f  , f ) = :  (f  , f ) : =  ,  deg  = 1 . (23)

5

They will be enumerated by Greek letters , , , . . .. With these constraints the physical Hilbert space is determined by the conditions a |

(24)

for all a and . Note that here we have assumed that the constraint operators are selfadjoint. If they are not self-adjoint we will assume that they appear in pairs such as (,  ) which in turn allows us to generate self-adjoint constraints via proper linear combinations like  +  and i - i . Following Dirac [14] we group the constraints into two classes. For first-class constraints the above conditions (24) need to be enforced only initially at t = 0 as the quantum evolution guarantees that a physical state will always remain in the physical Hilbert space as time evolves. If this is not the case there exists at least one constraint which is of second class. The above characterization of first-class constraints is equivalent to the requirement that they obey the following commutation and anticommutation relations. [a , b ] := a b - b a = icab c c , [a ,  ] = ida   , [a , H] = iha b b , (25) (26)

{ ,  } = ig a a . [ , H] = ik   .

In other words, the constraints together with the Hamiltonian form a Lie superalgebra [8] defined by the structure constants c, d, g, h and k. In general these structure constants could be operator-valued quantities depending on the fermion operators. Throughout this paper we will, however, consider only thoses cases where the structure constants are complex valued numbers. Let us also note that the first-class constraints alone define a Lie superalgebra (25) which is an ideal of the total algebra including (26). This ideal generates a Lie supergroup (via the usual exponential map) which in turn would enable us to construct in combination with the associated invariant Haar measure [15] a proper projection operator in analogy to the approach of [1]. However, things are much simpler in this case. In particular, with the help of the last anticommutation relation in (25) one can easily show that the first condition in (24), that is, a | phys = 0 for all a, implies the second one. In other words, in the case of first-class constraints the odd constraints are implied by the even constraints. This argument holds only for the case when even constraints are present. If this would not be the case, then the algebra of the constraints reduces to { ,  } = 0 for all  and . This algebra, however, does not have a non-trivial (in)finite-dimensional realization. Actually, such an algebra implies  | = 0 for all  and all   H. Or in other words, the only possible self-adjoint realization of purely odd first-class constraints are given by   0, and hence does not represent any constraints.

3.1

The projection operator

Because of the above mentioned properties it suffices to consider only the ordinary Lie algebra spanned by the even constraints {a } with structure constants cab c . We may construct a proper projection operator via the invariant Haar measure of the corresponding Lie group following [1]. Let us be more explicit. The general group element generated by the even constraints is given by exp{-i a a (f  , f )} , (27)

6

where { a } are real group parameters. To be more precise, (27) is a 2N -dimensional unitary fully reducible representation of this Lie group in H. For simplicity, we consider here only the case of a compact group. For the treatment in cases of non-compact groups see [16]. For a compact group, let us denote the corresponding invariant normalized Haar measure by dµ(). Then a proper projection operator may be defined by [17] E := dµ() exp{-i a a } (28)

which due to the invariance of the Haar measure and the group-composition law obviously obeys the properties E = E 2 = E  of an orthogonal projector. It projects onto the physical Hilbert space since by construction the physical states are the eigenstates of E with eigenvalue one, E | phys = | phys . Furthermore, we note that exp{-i a a }E = E for any set { a } and e-itH E = E e-itH = E e-itH E = E e-it(E HE ) E , (30) (29)

which is the (constrained) time-evolution operator in the physical subspace. As an aside we mention that this operator may be viewed as an element of the Lie group, associated with the Lie algebra spanned by the Hamiltonian and the even constraints, which is averaged over the subgroup associated with the subalgebra of the even constraints. In other words, it is invariant under right and left multiplication of this subgroup and, hence, belongs to the corresponding two-sided coset. Finally, let us mention that the N -fermion Hilbert space is finite dimensional and, hence, the spectrum of the constraints is pure point. Therefore, technical difficulties arising from a possible continuous spectrum of the constraints (see ref. [1]) do not occur.

3.2 Path-integral representations for the constrained propagator
Let us now construct a path-integral representation for the constrained propagator, that is, the coherent-state matrix element of the constrained time-evolution operator (30):   |e-itH E |  =   |e-itH e-i = ¯ d0 d0   |e-itH e-i

Despite the fact that in this path integral the time-dependent real-valued functions { a } explicitly appear, which may be interpreted as Lagrange multipliers, it is completely independent of them as is clearly shown by the left-hand side. Hence, as in [1], we are free to average the right-hand side over the functions { a } with an arbitrary in general complex-valued measure C() which is normalized, DC() = 1. The only requirement we impose on this measure is, that such an average will introduce at least one projection operator E to account for the initial value equation (24). If it puts in two or more of these projection operators the result will be the same since E 2 = E . Hence, there are many forms for this measure which will be admissible. For an example see the Appendix. In doing so we have derived yet another path-integral representation of the constrained propagator.   |e-itH E |  = ¯ D D

In essence, formulas (33), (34) and (35) resemble the fermionic counter parts of the results (64), (65) and (66) in [1] where the bosonic case has been studied.

Examples of first-class constraints

As we have seen in the above discussion, the treatment of first-class constraints for fermionic systems is very much the same as that for bosonic systems [1]. In particular, it is sufficient to consider only even constraints which are bosonic in nature. Therefore, we will discuss below only two examples which demonstrate the minor differences to the bosonic case.

8

4.1

First example of first-class constraints

As a simple example with purely even constraints let us consider a system of an N fermion system subjected to the even constraint
N

(f  , f ) =
i=1

fi fi - M .

(36)

Obviously, this constraint fixes the number of fermions to M  N with M  N . In order to make the effects of the constraints more transparent we will consider only the pathintegral representation of the coherent-state matrix element of the projection operator
2

E =
0

d -i e = ,0 = E 2 = E  , 2

(37)

that is, we will consider a system with a vanishing Hamiltonian, H = 0, and limit ourselves to the special case M = 1, N = 2. Formally, the corresponding path integral is then given by ¯ D D DC() (38) t i ¯   ¯ ¯ ( ·  -  · ) - ( ·  - 1) d × exp i 2 0 and leads to the coherent-state matrix element (for details see the Appendix)  |E | = e-
¯  · /2 - · /2 ¯

e

¯  · 

(39)

where we have adopted the short-hand notation of (17). We leave it to the reader to verify that this matrix element represents a reproducing kernel in the physical subspace given by the linear span of the two vectors |01 and |10 : ¯ dd  |E | |E | =  |E | , ¯ ¯ ¯ where dd := d1 d1 d2 d2 . (40)

4.2

Second example of first-class constraints

As a second example we will now consider a three-fermion system (N = 3) subjected to one even and two odd constraints given by
      = 1 - f1 f1 - f2 f2 - f2 f2 + f1 f1 f2 f2     +f2 f2 f3 f3 + f3 f3 f1 f1 ,

(41)

 = f1 f2 f3 ,

    = f 3 f 2 f 1 .

These first-class constraints obey the Lie superalgebra [, ] = 0 = [ , ] , {,  } =  , 2 = 0 = ( )2 . (42)

Obviously, the six-dimensional physical subspace is characterized by having at least one empty and one occupied fermion state. As in the previous example the spectrum of the

9

even constraint  is integer and therefore the projection operator has the same integral representation. 2 d -i e (43) E = 2 0 and can explicitly be expressed in terms of the fermion number operators E
      = f1 f1 (1 - f2 f2 ) + f2 f2 (1 - f3 f3 ) + f3 f3 (1 - f1 f1 )

=1-.

(44)

The path integral for the coherent-state matrix element of the projection operator formally reads t ¯  |E | = D D DC() exp i d L , (45)

where L :=

 ¯  ¯ ¯ ·-· - 1-·

¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ +1 1 2 2 + 2 2 3 3 + 3 3 1 1 . An explicit path integration then leads to the result ¯  ¯  ¯  |E | =  |  ·  - 1 1 2 2 ¯  ¯  ¯  ¯  -2 2 3 3 - 3 3 1 1 = e-(

¯  ¯  ¯  ¯  +2 2 3 3 + 3 3 1 1 .

Second-class constraints

Second-class constraints are all those which are not first class. For second-class constraints it is not sufficient to start with an initial state on the physical subspace as in this case the time evolution generated by the Hamiltonian will generally depart from the physical subspace. In other words, after some short time interval (say ) one may have to project the state back onto the physical subspace. Hence, we are led to consider the constrained propagator   |E e-it(E HE ) E |  = lim   |E e-iH E e-iH E · · · E e-iH E | 
0 N -1 n=1 N 0

(48)

= lim

¯ dn dn
n=1

n |E e-iH E |n-1 .

Again we will closely follow the basic ideas used in the canonical coherent-state pathintegral approach [1]. Hence, we start by introducing the unit vectors | := E | /||E | || and set M  := ||E |  ||, M  := ||E |  ||. The path integral for the constrained propagator can then be rewritten as

Another relation may be obtained by assuming that the projection operator allows for an integral representation in terms of the even and odd constraints E = dµ (, ) e-i(
a  a +  )

(52)

where dµ stands for some even Grassmann-valued measure depending on the real variables   and the odd Grassmann numbers  which both may be considered as Lagrange multipliers. Using this relation in the path-integral expression (48) we find the representation (notation as in Sect. 2.3 except N =   )

Here let us remark that we have assumed that the constraints are self-adjoint. This is typically not the case for odd constraints, which then appear in pairs (,  ). As a ¯ consequence the Grassmann-valued Lagrange multipliers also appear in pairs (, ). In contrast to the first-class constraints, in the present case one cannot neglect the odd constraints. However, the appearance of Grassmann multipliers may be omitted at the expense of no longer having the constraints appear explicitly in the exponent of (52). Actually, because spec(E )  {0, 1} we may always choose the following simple integral representation of the projection operator
2

E =

d -i(1-E ) e . 2

(55)

Again we would like to point out that eqs. (48)-(51) are the fermion counterparts of eqs. (104)-(106) of ref. [1], and relation (54) corresponds to (109) in [1].

Examples of second-class constraints

Even fermionic constraints are in essence similar to bosonic constraints which have extensively been discussed in [1]. For this reason we will concentrate our attention in this section exclusively on odd second-class constraints. We will start with two simple examples of constraints linear in fermion operators and then generalize our approach to an arbitrary set of linear constraints. Based on an example of a non-linear odd constraint we will show that all non-linear diagonal odd constraints can be reduced to the linear case.

6.1

Linear odd constraints

As mentioned above we will begin our discussion with a simple, that is N = 1, fermion system which obeys the constraints =f - , ¯  = f  -  . (56)

¯ Here ,   CB2 are odd Grassmann numbers. The constraints (56) obey the following anticommutation relations {,  } = 1 , 2 = 0 = ( )2 (57)

and, therefore, one cannot impose both constraint conditions |

simultaneously. Such a procedure would clearly lead to an inconsistent quantum theory. There are several ways to relax the conditions in order to formulate a consistent approach. Here we adopt an approach similar to the so-called holomorphic quantization [6] utilized for bosonic models with similar constraint inconsistencies. That is, we will consider only one of the above two conditions to define a proper physical Hilbert subspace. However, both possible cases will be discussed for completeness.

6.1.1

The solution of (58) in case A is obviously given by the fermion coherent state | and the corresponding projection operator reads E A = | | =  = =

The diagonal coherent-state matrix element of this operator, needed for example in evaluating the path integral (49), is given by ¯ ¯ n |E A |n = exp{-(n - )(n - )} . (60)

 ¯ ¯ ¯ dd e-/2 ei(+ ) = 1 - E A

6.1.3

A second example

As a second example of linear constraints let us consider an N = 2 fermion system subjected to the two odd constraints 1  =  (f1 - f2 ) , 2 1    =  (f1 - f2 ) , 2 (68)

which also obey the algebra (57). In analogy to the previous example we may again consider two different physical subspaces according to case A and B in (58). For case A the physical Hilbert space is the two-dimensional subspace spanned by  the fermion number eigenstates |00 and (|01 + |10 )/ 2. The corresponding projection operator is given by E A =  and admits integral representations as given in (59). The path integral for its matrix element (for simplicity we consider here the system H = 0) leads to     1 2 |E A |1 2 ¯ ¯ =     |    1 - 1 (  -   )(  -   ) (69)

In case B we are dealing with the projection operator E B = 1 - E A =   and its integral representations are the same as in (65). This operator projects onto the orthogonal complement of the previous case, that is, onto the subspace spanned by |11  and (|01 - |10 )/ 2. Here the result of path integration for the coherent-state matrix element of E B reads

6.1.4

Generalization

The above discussion may easily be generalized to a set of diagonal linear second-class constraints obeying the anticommutation relations { ,  } = 0 = { ,  } ,   { ,  } =  ,  (71)

where ,   {1, 2, . . . , M }, M  N . Clearly, for each  one has two choices for a () () projection operator, E A =   or E B =   . Therefore, for the total physical   subspace the corresponding projection operator is not unique and we have to choose one out of the following 2M possible operators, E = E i1 E i2 · · · E iM ,
(1) (2) (M )

i  {A, B} ,

(72)

leading to 2M pairwise orthogonal 2N -M -dimensional subspaces of the N -fermion Hilbert N space H = C2 . In fact, we may be even more general and assume some non-diagonal linear odd constraints obeying the algebra { ,  } = w = w , w  R . (73)

14

For simplicity we have chosen here self-adjoint odd second-class constraints. This system of constraints can easily be reduced to the above diagonal case. To be explicit, let D  SO(M ) denote the orthogonal matrix which diagonalizes the symmetric matrix W , (W ) = w . That is, we choose D such that  Then we may define new constraints via  = (D T )   / v which are diagonal  { ,  } =  ,   (75) and can be treated as discussed above. Note that v > 0 as we are dealing with secondclass constraints. In essence, the conclusion of this section is, that any set of linear odd second-class constraints is reducible to the diagonal case and in turn can be incorporated into the path integral. (DT W D) = v  . (74)

6.2

Nonlinear odd constraints

Let us now consider odd constraints which are not linear in the fermion operators. Again we will begin our discussion with an elementary example which is an N = 4 fermion system with constraints given by Note that =0= as before, however, the anti-commutator is no longer proportional to the identity. To be explicit, it is given by {,  } = X where
      X := 1 + f2 f2 f3 f3 f4 f4 + f2 f2 f3 f3 f4 f4 .

2

( )2

  = f1 - f2 f3 f4 ,

    = f 1 - f 4 f 3 f 2 .

(76)

(77) (78) (79)

Note that spec(X) = {1, 2} and therefore its inverse is well-defined
     1  X -1 = 1 - 1 f2 f2 f3 f3 f4 f4 - 2 f2 f2 f3 f3 f4 f4 . 2

As in the linear case we cannot impose both conditions, case A and B in (58), simultaneously. Hence, we again have to choose either case A or B. Which will lead us to two orthogonal eight-dimensional subspaces of H = C16 . Here, however, because of the non-linearity of the constraints, the projection operators are given by E A = X -1  , Note that [X, ] = 0 = [X,  ]. In essence, because X > 0 one simply replaces the original constraints by new ones,  (81)    = / X , E B = 1 - E A = X -1   . (80)

which by construction are "linear", i.e., constraints equivalent to linear, and can be treated as shown in the previous section. Obviously, this procedure can be generalized to a set of non-linear diagonal secondclass constraints obeying { ,  } = 0 = { ,  } ,   { ,  } = X   (82)

where X  0 does not vanish as  is assumed to be second class. Hence, we have  X > 0 and therefore we may redefine the odd constraints    =  / X which  brings us back to the linear case discussed above.

7

Application to Bose-Fermi systems

To complete our discussion we finally consider a system of M bosons and N fermions. The M bosonic degrees of freedom are characterized by bosonic annihilation and creation operators bi and b , respectively, which obey the standard commutation relations i [bi , bj ] = 0 , [b , b ] = 0 , i j [bi , b ] = ij . j (83)

These operators act on the M -boson Hilbert space L2 (R)  · · ·  L2 (R) = L2 (RM ). As in the case of fermions we will work in the (boson) coherent-state representation. These are eigenstates of the annihilation operators bi |zi

 L2 (R) ,

(84)

and for its M -fold tensor product, which represents an M -boson state, we will use the notation |z = |z1 1  · · ·  |zM M . The total Hilbert space of the combined boson fermion N system is thus H = L2 (RM )  C2 and the boson-fermion coherent states will be denoted by |z = |z  | . The dynamics of such a system is defined by the Hamiltonian which we choose to

Note that for M = N this Hamiltonian characterizes a supersymmetric quantum system [18]. The interaction of the bosons and fermions is introduced via the even first-class constraint

which fixes the fermion number Nf and the boson number Nb to obey the equality Nf = Nb - p.

Conclusions

In this paper we have extended the bosonic coherent-state path-integral approach of constrained systems [1] to those with fermionic degrees of freedom. As in the bosonic case we find that this approach does not involve any -functionals of the constraints nor does it require any gauge fixing of first-class or elimination of variables for second-class constraints. In addition we have shown that in the case of first-class constraints for fermion systems it is sufficient to consider only those which have an even Grassmann parity. In other words, for first-class constraints the Lagrange multipliers are ordinary real-valued functions of time. There is no need to introduce either even or odd Grassmann-valued multipliers. In this respect first-class constraints of fermion systems are not much different than those of boson systems and can be incorporated in the path-integral approach in the same way. This also applies to even second-class constraints. It is only in the case of odd second-class constraints where Grassmann-valued Lagrange multipliers may appear in the path-integral approach. For the cases of linear and non-linear diagonal second-class constraints we have been able to reduce the problem to the simpler case of linear diagonal odd constraints which however does not allow for a consistent quantum formulation. Here we have adopted a consistent formulation by imposing only half (case A or B) of the second-class constraints. If one wants to avoid the appearance of Grassmann-valued Lagrange multipliers at all then by virtue of relation (55) one can choose for the projection () () operators E A and E B in Sect. 6.1 the simple integral representations EA =

This procedure in effect amounts to replacing the odd second-class constraints  and   () () by the even constraints A :=   and B :=   , respectively. Note that from   (71) it immediately follows that for  =  [A , A ] = 0 ,

[A , B ] = 0 ,

In other words, these even constraints are first class. So we finally conclude that any odd first-class constraint and a wide range (linear and diagonal non-linear) of odd second-class constraints appearing in fermion systems can be completely avoided within the approach presented in this paper.

Choice of Consistent Family, and Quantum Incompatibility
arXiv:quant-ph/9708028v1 14 Aug 1997
Robert B. Griffiths Department of Physics Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213, U.S.A. Version of 1 August 1997
In consistent history quantum theory, a description of the time development of a quantum system requires choosing a framework or consistent family, and then calculating probabilities for the different histories which it contains. It is argued that the framework is chosen by the physicist constructing a description of a quantum system on the basis of questions he wishes to address, in a manner analogous to choosing a coarse graining of the phase space in classical statistical mechanics. The choice of framework is not determined by some law of nature, though it is limited by quantum incompatibility, a concept which is discussed using a two-dimensional Hilbert space (spin half particle). Thus certain questions of physical interest can only be addressed using frameworks in which they make (quantum mechanical) sense. The physicist's choice does not influence reality, nor does the presence of choices render the theory subjective. On the contrary, predictions of the theory can, in principle, be verified by experimental measurements. These considerations are used to address various criticisms and possible misunderstandings of the consistent history approach, including its predictive power, whether it requires a new logic, whether it can be interpreted realistically, the nature of "quasiclassicality", and the possibility of "contrary" inferences.

Introduction

The consistent history approach [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] to quantum theory provides a precise conceptual framework for describing how a closed quantum system (isolated from its environment, or with the environment itself included as part of a single closed system) develops in time. It reproduces the results of standard textbook quantum theory while avoiding the well-known paradoxes associated with the "measurement problem", Bell's inequality, and the like [7, 8]. It shows promise for application to quantum optics [9], quantum computing [10] and quantum cryptography [11]. At the same time, the consistent history approach has been the subject of various criticisms [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] which center upon the fact that the formalism allows the

physicist to choose from a very large number of alternative frameworks or consistent families of histories, all of which are considered "equally valid" in the sense that no fundamental physical law determines which family should be used in any given case. Were this "freedom of choice" the counterpart of gauge symmetry in classical electromagnetism, it would be of no concern. However, different frameworks are often mutually incompatible in a manner which means that the use of one to describe a given physical system precludes the use of another, that certain questions can only be addressed if one uses the appropriate framework, and that results from incompatible frameworks cannot be combined to form a single quantum description. The resulting conceptual problems have given rise to the claim that consistent history quantum theory is incomplete and lacking in predictive power [16, 17], that it is logically incoherent and incompatible with physical realism [12, 13, 14, 15], or that the physicist's choice (within this interpretation of quantum theory) must necessarily influence reality [12, 15]. While all of these claims can be countered by a detailed analysis based upon consistent history principles, as we shall see below, the fact that they have been made by scientists who have studied consistent histories in some detail means that the conceptual problems which give rise to them are likely to trouble others as well. Hence the present paper contains a detailed examination of these problems, using a systematic formulation of the consistent history approach published under the title "Consistent histories and quantum reasoning", hereafter referred to as CHQR [7]. Indeed, the arguments presented below are a continuation of a discussion already begun in CHQR as to how the formal principles of consistent history quantum theory, which appear to be sound, should be understood in physical terms and applied in particular situations. The basic conclusion of the present paper is that the criticisms mentioned above do not indicate any deficiency or lack of logical coherence in the consistent history approach, once it is properly understood. Instead, the main problem is that the full import of the "single consistent family" condition, which prohibits combining results from incompatible families, has not always been appreciated, despite the fact that it was stated in the very first publication devoted to consistent histories [20], and has been repeated many times since [21]. In addition, even physicists who accept the usual Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics often adopt, without giving the matter enough thought, a mode of reasoning about its physical consequences which is in basic conflict with the underlying mathematics. A consequence is that one of the few interpretations of quantum theory constructed in such a way that its rules of reasoning are consistent with Hilbert space mathematics is criticized for being logically incoherent! The structure of this paper is as follows. Section II contains a brief review of the principles of consistent history reasoning as found in CHQR, followed by applications of these principles to a simple gedanken experiment. Various consistent families, or frameworks, which are incompatible with each other are constructed, and it is shown how they can be used to derive a variety of physical conclusions. The problems of choice and of incompatibility emerging from this example are summarized at the end of the section. The analysis of these two problems begins with a discussion of various classical analogies, in Sec. III. Here it is argued that the choice of a quantum framework is, among other things, like the choice of a coarse graining for a classical phase space, and hence can properly be considered a choice made by the physicist, not a consequence of some "law of nature". However, incompatibility between frameworks is a quantum effect with no good classical 2

analog, and must be dealt with in quantum terms. This is the topic of Sec. IV, in which properties of a spin half particle are used as a sort of quantum analogy in order to discuss general properties of quantum incompatibility. In addition, a simple example shows how the predictions of consistent histories for what goes on in a closed quantum system can, in principle, be confirmed by experimental measurements. Section V begins with a summary of the conclusions which can be drawn from the preceding arguments, and then continues with some applications to various criticisms and (actual or potential) misunderstandings of the consistent history approach. These include the question of whether consistent histories requires a new form of logic, whether it can be interpreted in a realistic sense, a reply to the claim that the consistent history approach lacks predictive power, comments on the nature of "quasiclassicality", and reasons why there cannot be a "list of true histories". The appendices contain somewhat more technical arguments which address recent claims that consistent history quantum mechanics allows "contrary inferences" [19], and that it cannot reproduce consequences of standard quantum mechanics even if the future is thought to be "quasiclassical" [18].

A Simple Example of Quantum Reasoning

The basic structure needed in order to treat quantum mechanics as a probabilistic theory is the same as for all other types of probabilistic reasoning: a sample space of mutually exclusive elementary events, one and only one of which occurs. These "events" in the quantum case are elementary histories; see Sec. II below for some examples. They are analogous to the classical histories obtained by flipping a coin several times in a row. For example, the sample space for a coin flipped three times in a row consists of eight sequences, HHH, HHT, . . . TTT, (H=heads, T=tails), one and only one of which is actually realized when the experiment is carried out. Compound events, which are collections of elementary events, together with the elementary events themselves, constitute the Boolean event algebra to which probabilities are assigned. (In the example of coin flipping just mentioned, the four sequences corresponding to "H on the first toss" are a compound event.) In the quantum case, the algebra of events is called a consistent family or framework. It must be chosen according to appropriate quantum mechanical rules, as discussed in CHQR. Provided these rules are satisfied, probabilities are assigned using a set of non-negative weights calculated from the unitary time evolution engendered by Schr¨dinger's equation. Given these probabilities, the physical consequences o of the theory, typically in the form of conditional probabilities, are calculated following precisely the same rules as in other applications of standard probability theory. The peculiar features of quantum theory come about from the fact that there are usually a large number of different ways of choosing the sample space or consistent family, and it is necessary to pay careful attention to which of these is being used to study a particular problem. In classical physics it usually suffices to consider a single sample space, and in those instances in which more than one is used, relating the different sample spaces is relatively straightforward, unlike quantum theory, where the rules are more complicated. For further details, see CHQR. A simple example which will serve to illustrate the principles of quantum reasoning just 3

discussed is shown in Fig. 1. A photon which is initially in channel a passes through a beamsplitter B and is later detected by one of two detectors, C and D. The unitary time evolution produced by the beamsplitter takes the form  (1) |a  |s = (|c + |d )/ 2, where |a is a wave packet for the photon in the entrance channel a, |c and |d are wave packets in the exit channels c and d, and |s is a coherent superposition of the latter. The interaction of the photon with each of the detectors is given by the unitary transformations |c |C  |C  , |d |D  |D  , (2)

where |C indicates a detector in a state ready to detect a photon, and |C  the state which results when the photon is detected. Note that |C and |C  differ from each other in some macroscopic, visible property; for example, the position of a pointer. The states |D and |D  of the other detector have a similar interpretation. Some other particle, such as a neutron, could replace the photon without altering the following discussion in any significant way. Or one could imagine a spin-half particle going through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus which separates an Sx = 1/2 initial state into two beams with Sz = 1/2 and Sz = -1/2 directed to separate detectors. In the consistent history approach, the photon and the detectors are thought of as forming a single, closed quantum system, and the quantum mechanical description applies to the system as a whole. (In principle the beam splitter should also be included, but since its quantum state plays no role in the following discussion, it is omitted so as not to clutter up the notation.) The unitary time development of the total system then takes the form |0  |s CD  |S , where |0 = |aCD , (4) the initial state at a time t0 , evolves under the action of Schr¨dinger's equation to a state o |s CD at a time t1 when the photon has passed through the beam splitter, and then to  |S = (|C  D + |CD )/ 2 (5) at a time t2 after the photon has been detected by one of the detectors. Since |C  and |C are macroscopically distinguishable, as are also |D and |D  , |S is a macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) or "Schr¨dinger's cat" state. o One can think of (3) as a quantum history based upon the three times t0 , t1 , and t2 . In the notation of CHQR it is represented as a projector 0  s CD  S (6) (3)

on the tensor product space of histories, where we adopt the convention, here and below, that a symbol outside a ket denotes the corresponding projector, for example, S = |S S|. 4 (7)

For present purposes the tensor product structure is not important, and (6) should simply be thought of as a statement that the system started off in the initial state 0 (or |0 ) at t0 , was in a state s CD at t1 , and in the state S at time t2 . The consistent history approach supports such a "realistic" interpretation for reasons indicated in CHQR and in Sec. IV C below. The first consistent family or framework F1 we shall discuss has a sample space of elementary families consisting of (6) together with three additional histories ~ 0  s CD  S, 0  (I - s CD)  S, ~ S = I - S, ~ 0  (I - s CD)  S, (8)

where I is the identity operator on the Hilbert space, and (9)

is the negation of S, and means "S did not occur". The four projectors in (6) and (8) are the elementary histories which constitute the sample space of F1 . (They sum to 0 rather than to the history space identity because we regard F1 , along with the families we shall consider later, as having a fixed initial event; see remarks towards the end of Sec. III in CHQR.) However, quantum theory assigns a weight of zero to the histories in (8), which means they are dynamically impossible, and have zero probability to occur. When discussing other families, we will usually not display the zero-weight histories explicitly. Because the sample space has only one history, (6), with finite weight, we can infer that Pr(S2 | 0 ) = 1, (10)

where the subscripts, in this and later formulas, always refer to the times at which the events occur: S2 is a shorthand for "S at time t2 ". Thus, given that the system was in the state |0 at t0 , it will certainly (with probability 1) be in the state |S at time t2 . As is well known, unitary time evolution of this sort is something of an embarrassment for standard quantum mechanics, because physicists typically prefer to draw the conclusion that at time t2 the system is in one of the two states |C  D or |CD , each with a certain probability, rather than in the hard-to-interpret MQS state |S . The endless discussions about how to interpret the state |S and resolve the corresponding "measurement" problem have been rightly criticized by Bell [22]. The consistent history solution to this measurement problem is to introduce a distinct consistent family F2 based upon a sample space of elementary histories 0  s CD  C  D, 0  s CD  CD , (11) ~ together with others of zero weight, such as 0 s CD C  D. The physical interpretation of the first history in (11) is as follows: At t0 the photon was in state |a and the detectors were ready, at t1 the photon was in |s and the detectors remained in the ready state, whereas at t2 detector C had detected the photon, while D was still in its ready state, indicating that it had not detected the photon. The second history in (11) has the same interpretation with the roles of C and D interchanged. A straightforward application of the rules for calculating probabilities given in CHQR yields the results   Pr(C2 | 0 ) = 1/2 = Pr(D2 | 0 ), (12) 5

where, once again, the subscript 2 indicates an event at the time t2 . In words, (12) tells us that, given the initial state |0 at t0 , at time t2 the probability is 1/2 that detector C will have detected the photon, and 1/2 that it will have been detected by D. Similarly, one can show that     Pr(C2  D2 | 0 ) = 1, Pr(C2  D2 | 0 ) = 0, (13) where "" stands for (non exclusive) "or", and "" means "and". That is, at t2 it is certain (probability one) that one or the other of the detectors has detected the photon, and it is not true (because the probability is 0) that both detectors have detected the photon. Thus by using family F2 , the consistent history approach provides a definite, albeit probabilistic, answer to the question "which detector detected the photon?", and this is the answer which everyone who uses standard quantum theory agrees is correct. Notice that this is done without the MQS state |S ever entering the discussion and causing the sort of confusion pointed out by Bell [22]. Indeed, according to consistent history rules, |S at time t2 cannot enter a discussion based upon F2 , because it is incompatible with the histories in F2 in the sense that it cannot be added to F2 without violating the rules for constructing quantum event algebras. In particular, the event algebra must be a Boolean algebra of projectors, and the projector S does commute with either C  D or CD , so cannot be part of a Boolean algebra which contains the latter. Combining any discussion of |S at time t2 with F2 violates the single framework rule of quantum reasoning, CHQR Sec. III. For the very same reason, it is impossible to include either C  or D  at time t2 in family F1 , and hence, if one employs F1 , one cannot, according to the rules of consistent history quantum theory, address the question of which detector has detected the particle. Such a discussion is "meaningless" in the technical sense that this interpretation of quantum theory assigns it no meaning. In the consistent history approach one cannot interpret |S to mean "|C  D or |CD for all practical purposes", or for any other purposes. Quantum incompatibility is also the reason why we cannot combine (10) with (12) to reach the conclusion  Pr(S2  C2 | 0 ) = 1/2, (14) a result which would follow immediately by standard probabilistic reasoning from (10) and (12) if these probabilities were based upon the same sample space. But the sample spaces for F1 and F2 are distinct, and they cannot be combined to form a common sample space. This is a typical quantum mechanical effect which serves to define when two consistent families are mutually incompatible. Consequently, the left side of (14) is meaningless, and assigning it the value 1/2, or any other value, is a logical error. Now consider a third family of histories F3 based on a sample space containing two histories of finite weight, 0  c  C  , 0  d  D  , (15) together with additional histories of zero weight. (The projectors at t1 and t2 in the histories in (15), unlike those in (11), do not project onto pure states. However, one could replace c with c CD, C  with C  D, etc. without altering the following discussion.) The family F3 is obviously incompatible with F2 because the projectors c and d at t1 do not commute with s, and it is obviously incompatible with F1 for the same reason, and also because of the detector states at t2 .

6

The conditional probabilities (12) can be derived in F3 as well as in F2 ; this reflects a very general result (CHQR Sec. IV) that conditional probabilities of this type always have the same values in any framework in which they can be defined, whether or not the frameworks are incompatible. In addition, in F3 (but not F2 ) one has Pr(c1 | 0 ) = 1/2 = Pr(d1 | 0 ), (16) a sort of microscopic analog of (12). In words, given the initial state at t0 , one can conclude that at time t1 the photon will be either in the c channel with probability 1/2, or in the d channel with the same probability. Note that these probabilities, unlike those of standard textbook quantum theory, make no reference to measurements, which only take place some time later. That later measurements yield corresponding probabilities, (12), is perfectly consistent with the general principle, see Sec. IV D, that the probabilities assigned to events and histories by the consistent history approach can always be checked, in principle, using suitable (idealized) measurements. (Measurements play no distinguished role in consistent history quantum mechanics; if a closed quantum system contains some measuring apparatus, the events involving the apparatus are analyzed in precisely the same way as all other events.) Both (12) and (16) can be obtained by straightforward application of the Born rule of standard quantum theory (although its use in (16) might be regarded as problematical by some practitioners, since no measurement is involved). But the next result,
 Pr(c1 | 0  C2 ) = 1,  Pr(d1 | 0  C2 ) = 0,

(17)

goes beyond anything one can calculate with the Born rule. It says that given the initial state, and the fact that at t2 it was detector C which detected the photon, one can be certain that at time t1 the photon was in the c channel and not in the d channel. Given the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, this is a very reasonable result, and shows another way in which consistent history methods make sense out of quantum measurements. That appropriate measurements will reveal properties a measured system had before it interacted with the apparatus is a principle used constantly in the design of experimental equipment, and the inability of standard textbook quantum mechanics to explain this is a defect just as serious as its inability to deal with Schr¨dinger's cat. o Notice that the result just discussed can be obtained using F3 , but not F2 or F1 . The question "was the photon in c or d at time t1 ?" is not meaningful in F1 and F2 because the projectors c and d needed to answer it are incompatible with these families. On the other hand, if we use F2 we can derive the result
 Pr(s1 | 0  C2 ) = 1.

(18)

That is, under the same conditions as in (17), one can conclude with certainty that at time t1 , the particle was in the superposition state |s defined in (1). Just as in the case of (10) and (12) discussed earlier, because (17) and (18) were derived in two incompatible families, they cannot be combined to reach the nonsensical conclusion
 Pr(c1  s1 | 0  C2 ) = 1,

(19)

which, were it correct, would be the analog of asserting that a spin half particle has both Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2 at the same time. 7

In summary, we have studied the gedanken experiment shown in Fig 1 using three separate and mutually incompatible frameworks or consistent families, F1 , F2 , and F3 , each based upon its own sample space of histories involving events at the three times t0 , t1 , and t2 , and have derived a number of different (probabilistic) conclusions. There are many (in fact, an uncountably infinite number of) other frameworks which could have been employed to discuss the same situation. The fact that the same physical system can be discussed using many different frameworks gives rise to the problem of choice: how does one decide which framework is appropriate for describing what goes on in this closed quantum system? A partial answer is suggested by the fact that certain questions of physical interest, such as "which detector detected the photon?", and "which channel was the photon in before it was detected?" can be addressed in certain families but not in other families, because the projectors needed to provide a quantum mechanical representation of the question are only compatible with certain families. Thus incompatibility serves to limit choice, but at the same time it gives rise to the problem of incompatibility: how are we to understand the existence of, and the relationship among incompatible histories and families? These two problems will be discussed in the following sections, beginning with classical analogies in Sec. III, which will help us understand something of what is involved in choosing a quantum framework. Unfortunately, there is no good classical analog of quantum incompatibility, so the discussion of this concept in Sec. IV is based upon simple quantum examples. Combining the results from these two sections leads to the conclusions stated in Part A of Sec. V.

III

Classical Analogies

No classical analogy is fully adequate for understanding the implications of quantum theory, which must, in the end, be considered on its own terms. Nevertheless, classical ideas can be extremely helpful in suggesting fruitful ways to think about quantum principles. This is particularly true for the problem of choice, where classical analogies suggest (though they obviously cannot prove) that the freedom a physicist has in choosing a framework does not render the resulting theory unscientific or lacking in objectivity, nor does it mean that the physicist's choice somehow "influences reality". As a first analogy, consider a professional historian composing a history of Great Britain. Obviously, as a practical matter, he must choose to emphasize certain subjects and ignore, or at least give much less consideration, to others. The choice of topics is determined by what interests the historian (or perhaps the pressures on his professional career), and are not the consequence of some "law of history". Nor does his choice have any influence on historical events (at least those occurring prior to when his work is published). Nevertheless, the account he produces, if he does his job well, is not a purely subjective one, and other historians dealing with the same subject matter ought to concur about the historical facts, even if they disagree, as they surely will, about their significance. A second analogy is provided by a draftsman producing a representation of a threedimensional object on a two-dimensional piece of paper. In order to do this, he has to choose some perspective from which to view (or imagine viewing) the object. This choice is not determined by any "law of representation", though it can be influenced by pragmatic 8

considerations: some things can be better represented using one perspective than another. Nor, obviously, does the choice influence the object itself, although it constrains the amount and type of descriptive information which can be included in the drawing. The choice of gauge in classical electromagnetism provides a third analogy. This choice is a matter of convenience which obviously does not influence the system being described. In addition, the same physical conclusions can be drawn using any gauge, so the choice is based entirely on pragmatic considerations. To be sure, this is different from what encounters in the case of quantum families, since, as noted repeatedly for the example in Sec. II, the topics one can discuss, and thus the conclusions one can draw, do depend upon which family is employed. Nonetheless, a particular conditional probability can often be calculated in many different families, and in all families in which it can be calculated it has the same value. Thus, for example, (12) can be obtained using either F2 or F3 , though not F1 . Hence, relative to a particular conditional probability, the choice among the families in which it can be computed is similar to the choice of a gauge. Classical Hamiltonian mechanics, which describes a mechanical system with N degrees of freedom by means of a 2N-dimensional phase space , provides a fourth analogy. To be sure, once the phase space and the Hamiltonian have been specified, the only remaining choice is that of the appropriate phase space trajectory or orbit, (t), and this is typically made by assuming that the state  of the system is known at some time, say t = 0. While this choice bears some resemblance to the quantum choice problem, the disanalogies outnumber the positive analogies. Thus in the quantum case, with the exception of histories involving only one time, there is always more than one family consistent with a specification of the quantum state at an initial time. This reflects the fact that quantum mechanics is a stochastic theory, unlike classical mechanics, which is deterministic. In addition, the choice between classical trajectories is a choice between mutually exclusive alternatives: if one trajectory is a correct description of the system, all others must be incorrect. By contrast, the choice between consistent families is never a choice between mutually exclusive alternatives in this same sense, and while different quantum frameworks can be incompatible, incompatibility is a very different relationship from that of being mutually exclusive, as will be shown in Sec. IV. Nevertheless, it is probably useful to include classical mechanics among our list of analogies, if for no other reason than that the disanalogous features are sometimes employed to analyze consistent history results, leading to the (erroneous) conclusion that the latter are unsatisfactory. Classical statistical mechanics, itself a stochastic theory, provides a better analogy for the quantum choice problem than does classical mechanics. Thus our fifth analogy is a coarse graining of the classical phase space (CHQR, Sec. VII A), a covering of  by a set of non-intersecting cells, which provides a coarse-grained description of the system through specifying which cell is occupied by the phase point at a succession of times. (Making these a finite set of discrete times, and allowing the cells defining the coarse graining to depend upon time, produces the closest analogy with the quantum case.) Choosing a coarse graining and choosing a quantum framework are analogous in that in both cases the choice is one made by the physicist in terms of the physical problems he wishes to discuss, and is not something dictated by the laws of nature. At least in the case of the classical coarse graining, it is at once obvious that this choice has no influence on the behavior the system being described, although it may very well limit the type of 9

description which can be constructed. For example, in order to describe irreversible or other hydrodynamic behavior, one wants cells which are not too large, but also not too small. Because the coarse graining is chosen by the physicist, the corresponding description can be said to be "subjective", but this is a harmless subjectivity, because two physicists who use the same coarse graining will reach identical conclusions. There is another analogy in that once a coarse graining has been specified, one and only one coarse-grained history will actually occur, since a phase space trajectory will be in precisely one cell of the coarse graining at any given time. In probabilistic terms, a succession of cells from the classical coarse graining at a sequence of different times is an element of a sample space, just as an elementary history in a quantum framework is an element of a sample space, and given a sample space, one expects that one and only one of the constituent "events" will actually occur. Along with the positive analogies just discussed, there is an important disanalogy between descriptions based on classical coarse grainings and those which employ quantum frameworks. Two classical coarse grainings always possess a common refinement, a third coarse graining constructed from the intersections of the cells in the two collections. Thus given any two coarse-grained histories which describe the same system (over the same time interval), there is always a finer-grained history constructed using the common refinement, and which incorporates, or implies, each of the coarser histories. The ultimate refinement of all coarse grainings is, of course, a description of the system in terms of a phase space trajectory. Two compatible quantum frameworks possess (as a matter of definition) a common refinement, and for them the situation is quite analogous to the classical state of affairs just discussed. However, incompatible frameworks often arise in quantum theory, as illustrated in Sec. II, and their mutual relationship is necessarily different from that which exists among (always compatible) classical coarse grainings. The solution to the problem of (quantum) choice suggested by the classical analogies discussed above (with the exception of classical mechanics, where a good analog of a quantum choice does not exist) is that the choice can be made on pragmatic grounds, that is to say, relative to the physical problems which concern the physicist who is constructing a quantum description. There is, to be sure, no guarantee that this solution is the correct one, for analogies have their limitations, and we have just noted an important one in the case of classical statistical mechanics (which also applies to the other examples in this section): there is nothing which corresponds to quantum incompatibility. On the other hand, there is also no reason to suppose that, just because they are imperfect, the analogies have led us to a false solution of the choice problem. To obtain further insight, we need to take a closer look at quantum incompatibility in quantum terms. That is the subject of the next section.

IV A

Quantum Incompatibility
Logic in two dimensions

In Sec. II we introduced three separate consistent families of histories, or frameworks, to describe the same physical system. The analogy of the draftsman in Sec. III suggests that these can be thought of as three distinct, but equally valid, perspectives from which to describe the system. However, none of the analogies of Sec. III provides insight into the 10

fact that F1 , F2 , and F3 are incompatible alternatives. Quantum incompatibility of this sort has no good classical analog, so one needs to employ quantum examples in order to understand it. The simplest non-trivial quantum system, a two-dimensional Hilbert space, which we shall think of as representing the angular momentum states of a spin half particle, can provide some useful insight into what is going on. The discussion given here employs a somewhat different point of view from that in CHQR Sec. VI A, and can be thought of as supplementing the latter. The histories of interest involve only one time, and the "event" at this time corresponds to a ray, or one-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space, whose physical interpretation is that the component of spin angular momentum in a particular direction in space is 1/2 (in units of h). For example, a particular ray which we denote by Z + (the same symbol denotes ¯ the ray and the projector onto the ray) corresponds to the proposition "Sz = 1/2". What corresponds to the negation of this proposition, to "it is not the case that Sz = 1/2"? While one might suppose it to be "the spin is in some other direction", standard quantum mechanics identifies negation of a proposition with the orthogonal complement of the corresponding subspace, which means that the negation of "Sz = 1/2" is the unique ray Z - perpendicular to Z + , which corresponds to the proposition "Sz = -1/2". Understanding negation in this way has a certain plausibility: after all, if Sz is not equal to 1/2, what other value can it have? Furthermore, applying negation twice in a row brings us back to the original property. Nonetheless, the translation of logical terms, such as "not", into a quantum context is a nontrivial matter, and the reader who is not content with the traditional approach is welcome to try and improve upon it. If we agree that the negation of a ray R in a two-dimensional Hilbert space is the or~ thogonal ray R, the next question to address is the definition of "R and S" (R  S) for two rays. Guided by the rules of ordinary propositional logic, it is plausible that if S = R, then R  R = R, and if S is the negation of R, ~ ~ R  R = R  R = 0, (20) where 0 is proposition which is always false, corresponding to a projector onto the origin of ~ the Hilbert space. But what if S is neither R nor R? We might suppose that in such cases there is always a third ray T (which depends, of course, on R and S) such that R  S = T. However, (21) is unsatisfactory, for consider the result ~ ~ ~ R  T = R  (R  S) = (R  R)  S = 0  S = 0 (22) (21)

obtained by applying the usual logical rules governing "". For this to hold, T must be ~ the same as R, since in all other cases we are assuming that R  T is another ray, not 0. ~ However, the argument in (22) applied to T  S tells us that this, too, is 0, so that T must be the same as S. But T cannot be equal to both R and S, since, by hypothesis, they are unequal. One way out of this dilemma is to follow Birkhoff and von Neumann [23] , and assume that whenever R and S are unequal, "R and S" is false: R = SR  S = 0. 11 (23)

Taking the negation of both sides of the equality in (23), and using the usual rules of logic, we conclude that, under the same conditions, "R or S" (R  S) is true: R = SR  S = I, (24) where I represents the proposition which is always true, corresponding to the identity operator on the Hilbert space. Alas, (23) and (24) lead to a contradiction if we employ the standard distributive law of propositional logic: Q  (R  S) = (Q  R)  (Q  S). (25)

The reason is that if Q, R, and S are three distinct rays, the left side of (25), using (23) and assuming that Q  0 = Q, is Q, while the right side, see (24), is I  I = I. Birkhoff and von Neumann's solution to this problem is to adopt a "quantum logic" in which (25) no longer holds. Consistent histories has a very different way of escaping the dilemma posed by (22). ~ When S is different from either R or R, the properties corresponding to these two rays are said to be incompatible, and R  S is considered to be meaningless: it is not a formula composed according to the syntactical rules which govern meaningful quantum discourse. To illustrate the difference between this and the approach of Birkhoff and von Neumann, suppose that Sz = 1/2 is true. According to (23), "Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2" is false, as is "Sx = -1/2 and Sz = 1/2". The normal rules of logic would then tell us that both Sx = 1/2 and Sx = -1/2 are false, which cannot be the case, since one is the negation of the other. Consequently, the usual rules of logical reasoning have to be modified if one uses the Birkhoff and von Neumann system. By contrast, in the consistent history approach, "Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2" is neither true nor false; instead, it is meaningless. Thus the truth of Sz = 1/2 tells us nothing at all about Sx , so we do not reach a contradiction. Similarly, in the consistent history approach it makes no sense to ask "is Sx = 1/2 or is Sz = 1/2?", for such a question implicitly assumes that the two can be compared: one is true and the other false, or perhaps both are true, or both are false. But none of these is possible under the rules of consistent history reasoning [24]. Unless propositions belong to the same framework, which in the particular example we are considering (but not in general; see below and App. A) is equivalent to requiring that the corresponding projectors commute with each other, the consistent history formalism allows no logical comparison between them, of any kind. In particular, it is very important to distinguish incompatible, which is the relationship between Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2, from mutually exclusive, the relationship between Sz = 1/2 and Sz = -1/2. As already noted, the truth of Sz = 1/2 tells us nothing at all about the truth or falsity of the incompatible Sx = 1/2. However, the truth of Sz = 1/2 at once implies that Sz = -1/2 is false, since the two are mutually exclusive: if a spin half particle emerges in one channel from a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, it surely does not emerge in the other channel. Standard textbook quantum mechanics escapes the dilemma of (22) by yet a different method, by ignoring it and treating a quantum system as a "black box" which can be subjected to external (classical?) measurements. But ignoring a problem does not necessarily make it go away, and the enormous conceptual confusion which besets "the measurement problem" in standard quantum theory is an almost inevitable consequence of its inability to provide clear principles for discussing the properties of a spin half particle. 12

IV B

Generalization to histories

In CHQR, two frameworks or consistent families F and F  were defined to be incompatible if they lack a common refinement, that is, if there is no consistent family G which contains all the histories in both F and F . Consistent with that usage, we shall say that two histories Y and Y  are incompatible if there is no (single) consistent family which contains both of them, and a framework F and a history Y  are incompatible if there is no consistent family G which contains Y  along with all the histories in F . The spin half case discussed above is best thought of as a "quantum analogy" which illustrates some, but not all of the features of incompatibility. In particular, it shows how incompatibility can arise when the projectors representing properties at a single time do not commute with each other. This is also the source of incompatibility for the histories and families discussed in Sec. II C, where the projectors on the Hilbert space of histories (as in (6) and (11)) do not commute with each other. Incompatibility can also arise because, even though the relevant projectors commute, consistency conditions are not satisfied for the enlarged Boolean algebra. For an example, see Sec. VI D in CHQR (and App. A below). Whatever the source of incompatibility, consistent histories quantum theory deals with it in the manner suggested above in the discussion of a spin half particle, through a syntactical rule which states that all logical argumentation must take place inside a single framework or consistent history (for details, see CHQR). On the other hand, the usual rules of reasoning apply within a single framework, and for these purposes no modifications of standard propositional logic are required. And, just as in the case of a spin half particle, it is important to distinguish quantum incompatibility, which means no comparison is possible between two histories (or results calculated in two frameworks), from mutually exclusive, the relationship between two elementary families belonging to the same framework. Thus if A and B are mutually exclusive, the truth of one implies the falsity of the other or, as histories, the occurrence of A means that B did not occur, and vice versa. If, on the other hand, A and B are incompatible, the truth of one, which can only be defined relative to some framework which contains it, tells us nothing about the truth or falsity of the other; they are "not comparable": no comparisons between them are possible, because such comparisons make no (quantum mechanical) sense. In particular, if A and B are incompatible histories, the question "did A occur or did B occur?" does not make sense, for there is no framework in which they could be compared. We have already applied these principles in discussing the examples in Sec. II, in particular when noting that no discussion of the MQS state S at time t2 can be meaningfully combined with the histories (11) used in F2 to discuss which detector detected the photon. Similarly, the family F1 of unitary time evolution cannot be used to discuss, much less answer, the question "which detector?", because F1 is incompatible with histories containing C  or D  at t2 . And since, as noted above, incompatibility prevents us from asking whether the history 0  s CD  S occurred rather than 0  s CD  C  D or 0  s CD  CD , it does not make sense to ask which of the incompatible frameworks F1 and F2 provides the correct description of this gedanken experiment. Generalizing from this example, we conclude that whenever F and G are any two incompatible families, one cannot ask which provides the correct quantum mechanical description; because the two sample spaces are mutually incompatible, they cannot be compared. But 13

even if F and G are compatible, it also makes no sense to ask which is correct, for in that case their relationship is analogous to that of two classical coarse grainings, as discussed in Sec. III, and it is obvious that one cannot say that one coarse graining provides a "correct" and another an "incorrect" physical description. Since alternative frameworks are either compatible or incompatible, we conclude that it is never sensible to ask "which is the correct framework?", at least in the same sense in which one can ask "which is the correct classical phase space trajectory?". The relationship between phase space trajectories is that between mutually exclusive possibilities, whereas quantum frameworks are not related to each other in this way. Of course it does make sense to ask "which framework is useful for solving this particular problem?", or "which framework provides one with the greatest physical insight?", just as in the case of classical coarse grainings.

IV C

Using measurements to confirm histories

Further insight into how the descriptions provided by two or more incompatible families are related to each other can be obtained by asking how the predictions of consistent history quantum theory about the behavior of a closed quantum system might, in principle, be verified experimentally. Imagine that the system is in a closed box, the initial state 0 is known, and the consistent historian (who, needless to say, is outside the box) has carried out calculations of probabilities for different histories belonging to a variety of distinct and mutually incompatible families. How might these probabilities be checked by measurements? Checking them involves opening the box, or at least letting the contents interact in some way with the external world, and this immediately raises the well-known problem that measurements might disturb what is going on in the box, so that the results they reveal might not be indicative of what would have happened in their absence. However, the very same objection can be raised in a "classical" context in which specifically quantum effects play no role. A box might contain sensitive photographic film which would be changed if one were to look at it. Or perhaps the box contains a bird which will escape if the box is opened. In the end there is no ultimate proof that one's measurement is not creating the effect observed, just as there can be no ultimate argument against solipsism. However, if he had a theory which was sufficiently powerful to predict the perturbing effects of a measurement, and if other predictions of this theory for other situations had been amply confirmed by experiment, a physicist (in contrast to a philosopher) would probably be willing to use it in order to design measurements which produced minimal perturbations, or to calculate the effects of perturbations if these were unavoidable. Consistent history quantum mechanics is a theory of this sort, unlike standard textbook quantum mechanics, whose inability to relate the results of measurements to properties of the system being measured is one of its principal deficiencies. Of course, using this approach cannot demonstrate that the consistent history predictions of what is going on in a closed box are "really true", but it does provide the sort of internally consistency which in other areas of science (e.g., the study of the earth's core by means of seismic waves) is considered good evidence for the existence of phenomena which cannot be directly observed. As an example, consider Fig. 2(a), which is a stripped down version of the gedanken experiment in Fig. 1, as the detectors C and D have been omitted from the quantum system enclosed in the box indicated by the heavy line. We consider two consistent families E1 and 14

E2 with histories of non-zero weight: E1 : E2 : a  c, a  d as (26) (27)

referring to events at the times t0 and t1 ; the notation is that of Sec. II. To check the predictions of E1 , we open holes in the sides of the box, Fig. 2(b), at a time just before the photon would have encountered one of the walls, to allow it to pass out of the box and be detected by one of the two detectors C and D. Since the two histories in (26) are predicted to occur with probability 1/2, checking this requires repeating the experiment a number of times. To determine whether opening the holes and placing detectors outside the box has somehow perturbed the system, we employ a consistent history analysis of the larger closed system which includes the original box and the detectors C and D (along with the mechanism for opening the holes, etc.). For this larger system we ask: if the photon is detected by C, was it earlier (while the holes were still closed) in the c channel? The answer is affirmative; see (17) and the associated discussion. As in each realization of the experiment the particle is detected by C or D, this confirms the usual consistent history interpretation of the two histories in (26) as mutually exclusive alternatives, one or the other of which must occur in any particular case. If we employ family E2 , the single history in (27) is predicted to occur every time the experiment is carried out. To verify this requires the slightly more complicated arrangement shown in Fig 2(c). Once again, the holes are opened at the last possible instant, but then a pair of mirrors and a second beam splitter are used to compare the phases of the wave packets emerging in the c and d channels. Assume the path lengths are arranged so that a photon initially in a eventually emerges in f . The fact that the photon is always detected by F , and never by E, can then be used as an experimental confirmation that it was in the state s at t1 , since a consistent history analysis of the larger closed system yields the result Pr(s1 | 0  F2 ) = 1. (28)

Once again, it is the ability of consistent histories to verify that a measured system had a particular property before the measurement took place which lends plausibility to the experimental confirmation of a prediction referring to processes going on in a closed system. Checking events at intermediate, rather than final times in a family of histories can be carried out using analogous, though somewhat more complicated arrangements. One can imagine the box to be supplied with ports through which probes of appropriate type can be inserted at appropriate times. The argument that this sort of measurement is possible in principle (that is, without violating the laws of quantum theory), and that appropriate measurements do not perturb the system in unacceptable ways, will be found in Sec. 5 of [1]. Alternatively, one can suppose that a single closed box contains both the system of interest and appropriate measuring apparatus which interacts with the system at suitable times and records the results. At the end of the experiment the box is opened and the records are read. In either case, the consistent history approach allows one to discuss whether the system actually did have the properties which the measurements revealed, and whether these measurements perturbed the system in unacceptable ways. Whether the events of interest occur at intermediate or final times, checking the predictions given by different incompatible frameworks always involves alternative experimental 15

arrangements which are either mutually exclusive, as in Fig. 2(b) and (c), or of a sort in which one set of measurements makes it impossible to discuss the system using some alternative consistent family. In any case, just as there is no single "correct" choice of consistent family for describing the system, there is no single arrangement of apparatus which can be used to verify the predictions obtained using different families. Note that neither the framework nor the experimental arrangement needed to check its predictions is singled out by some "law of nature". Indeed, were there some such law which told us, for example, that E1 is the correct framework, we would have great difficulty interpreting the results of measurements of the sort shown in Fig. 2(c). In this sense, the physicist's freedom to choose a framework, as suggested by the classical analogies in Sec. III, is not only possible in the presence of quantum incompatibility, but appears necessary in order to have a theory with a consistent physical interpretation.

Summary and Some Applications
Overall summary

The example in Sec. II together with the classical analogies in Sec. III and the discussion of incompatibility in Sec. IV lead to the following conclusions relative to the problems of choice and incompatibility as stated at the end of Sec. II. There are many posable consistent families or frameworks which can be used to describe the same quantum system, and the choice of which of these to employ is a choice made by the physicist based upon pragmatic considerations, namely the type of physical problem he is trying to study or the question he wants to answer. Because of quantum incompatibility, a question such as "where was the photon before it was detected?" can be answered in certain frameworks and not in others. Given a particular physical question there are still, in general, a large number of frameworks in which it can be discussed, but since they all yield the same values for the relevant conditional probabilities, choosing among them is, relative to this particular question, rather like the choice of gauge in classical electromagnetism: the answer does not depend upon the framework. The choice among alternative compatible families is closely analogous to the choice among coarse grainings of a classical phase space, a situation in which it is transparently obvious that the physicist's choice of a mode of description has no influence whatsoever on the physical system being described. Furthermore, such a choice is not "subjective" in any unacceptable way, for two physicists who use the same coarse graining will reach identical conclusions. That these same conclusions are still correct in the case of a choice between incompatible consistent families is not so obvious, because there is no good classical analogy. Nonetheless, their truth is supported by the discussion of quantum incompatibility in Sec. IV. To begin with, the relationship of incompatibility between frameworks (or between histories, etc.) is quite distinct from that between mutually exclusive alternatives (as in a sample space), where the correctness of one means that the others are necessarily false. Incompatible frameworks are never related in this way; and from the fact that some history has occurred, one cannot conclude that some other history incompatible with it has not occurred. Understanding the difference between mutually exclusive and incompatible helps prevent one from supposing that the physicist's choice of a framework somehow influences the world by "preventing" or 16

"interfering with" histories which occur in some other framework. Instead, the choice simply limits the type of description which the physicist can construct. Additional support is provided by the discussion, in Part C of Sec. IV, of how predictions of what goes on in a closed system based upon the consistent histories formalism, can in principle be checked experimentally. This "operational" point of view confirms that the choice of consistent family is up to the physicist, but that the experimental arrangements needed to confirm the predictions made using a particular framework depend upon that framework. By contrast, assuming that the framework is determined by some "law of nature", rather than chosen by the physicist, is rather unhelpful, since it produces new conceptual difficulties. Incompatibility, as noted in Sec. IV A, is a specifically quantum concept which represents one way of meeting the (necessary!) process of modifying the logic of classical propositions in order to achieve descriptions which conform to the way standard quantum theory employs Hilbert space. In the consistent history approach, incompatibility is a syntactical rule which governs which combinations of propositions about a quantum system can be said to be physically meaningful. In this respect it is quite different from the approach of Birkhoff and von Neumann [23], and has the advantage that within a single consistent family there is no need to replace the ordinary logic of propositions with a new "quantum logic". (By contrast, textbook quantum mechanics in effect evades the logical issues by constructing a phenomenological theory of measurement, thus giving rise to an insoluble "measurement problem" completely absent from the consistent histories approach.) To be sure, quantum incompatibility and the choice among incompatible frameworks for describing a particular quantum system are not matters which can be easily understood using an intuition trained largely by the "classical" world of everyday experience. This should come as no surprise: quantum mechanics is distinctly different from classical mechanics, and it is only to be expected that it contains concepts which conflict with pre-quantum thinking. The same is true of special relativity in relationship to Newtonian mechanics. The fact that events which occur at the same time in one coordinate system need not be simultaneous in another, and the physicist's ability to change the time difference between them by adopting a new coordinate system, have not been considered insuperable barriers, or even serious objections to adopting special relativity as a good scientific theory of the world, and supposing that it provides a better description of physical reality than pre-relativistic physics. Although the analogy is, of course, not perfect, there seems to be no reason why the physicist's liberty to choose a consistent family renders consistent histories an unsatisfactory interpretation of quantum theory, nor why quantum incompatibility should not be included with our other ideas about what constitutes physical reality.

VB

Logic, truth, and reality

The structure of quantum reasoning set forth in CHQR, which is largely compatible with earlier work by Omn`s [4, 6], agrees with but also differs from ordinary propositional logic, e depending upon one's point of view. As long as the discussion is confined to a single framework (or "logic", in Omn`s' terminology) the usual rules employed for ordinary probabilistic e theories apply, and no new logical concepts are required. In this respect one can agree with Omn`s that consistent histories quantum theory does not require a new "unconventional e logic" [25]. 17

On the other hand, the syntactical rules which determine what propositions can be part of a framework, whether two frameworks are compatible, and the like, are decidedly nonclassical, since their very definitions are based upon properties of the quantum Hilbert space and the corresponding unitary time transformations. As these rules are essential for correct quantum reasoning, and are thus central to the logical structure of quantum theory, it is also correct to say that, as least in this respect, consistent histories does involve a new form of logic, one with no classical counterpart. Thus d'Espagnat's assertion [26] that consistent histories reasoning ". . . could only be valid in some as yet unspecified logic, of which it is not even known how it could be self-consistent" is not off the mark, though it is now out of date, since in CHQR the required self-consistent logic has been specified in considerable detail, filling in various items lacking in the earlier [5]. s noted in Sec. IV A, the use of some form of non-classical reasoning is virtually inescapable once one accepts the association of propositions, and their negations, with subspaces of Hilbert space, in the way generally employed in standard quantum theory. Whereas consistent histories handles this in a very different way from the quantum logic of Birkhoff and von Neumann, it still employs nonclassical (and hence counterintuitive) ideas. One important difference between Omn`s and CHQR is in the definition of "true". In e CHQR, "true" is interpreted as "probability one". Thus if certain data are assumed to be true, and the probability, conditioned upon these data, of a certain proposition is one, then this proposition is true. The advantage of this approach is that as long as one sticks to a single framework, "true" functions in essentially the same way as in ordinary logic and probability theory. However, because probabilities can only be discussed within some framework, comparisons of "true" between incompatible frameworks are impossible, and in this sense "true" interpreted as "probability one" must be understood as relative to a framework. The feature just mentioned has been criticized by d'Espagnat [12, 13, 15]. But it is hard to see how to get around it if one wishes to maintain (as do Omn`s and I) that reasoning e inside a single framework should follow classical rules, and classical rules associate "true" (in a probabilistic theory) with "probability one". Omn`s' attempt to develop an alternative e definition of "true" [4, 6] did not succeed, as he himself admits [27], and at present there seems to be no serious alternative to CHQR. In defense of the latter it is worth noting that, as a very general principle, one cannot expect to import classical concepts into quantum theory "duty free", that is, without alterations, either in formal definitions, or in intuitive properties, or both. This is widely accepted by physicists in the case of dynamical quantities: we do not insist that quantum position and momentum commute with each other. That it also holds for logical properties and relationships deserves to be more widely appreciated; see the discussion of "not" and "and" in Sec. IV A (and of "contrary" in App. A). Thus it is unreasonable to expect that "quantum truth" will coincide with "classical truth" in every respect. The definition adopted in CHQR has some virtues; these include the fact that it is (almost) the same as its classical counterpart in the case of a single framework, and reduces to the usual sense of "true" in the classical (correspondence) limit in which incompatibility disappears and all frameworks possess a common refinement. Given these properties, it seems reasonable to adopt the definition given in CHQR as a suitable quantum counterpart of "true", at least until some superior alternative appears on the scene. Similarly, d'Espagnat [28] thinks that consistent history quantum theory cannot be inter18

preted in a realistic way, because it does not conform to "a basic requirement of traditional realism, that there are facts that are true quite independently of the conventions we decide to make as to which consistent family of histories we prefer to discuss." In response, it is worth noting that some modifications of traditional realism are only to be expected if quantum theory is one of the truly revolutionary developments of twentieth century science. Nevertheless, the changes in pre-quantum realism required if we adopt consistent histories are perhaps less radical than d'Espagnat's words might suggest. Note, first of all, that the choice of framework by a physicist is not something by which he can, in any sense, render true propositions untrue, or make untrue propositions true. The reason is that as long as frameworks are compatible, choosing one or another is as "harmless" as selecting one of the alternative coarse grainings of classical phase space, as discussed in Sec. III. If, on the other hand, some framework is chosen which is incompatible with a proposition, this choice does not make the proposition true or false; instead the proposition is "indiscussible" within this framework. As this point is often misunderstood, it may be helpful consider the specific example discussed in Part C of Sec. IV. Suppose that theorist T, standing outside the box of Fig. 2, has used family E2 , (27), to make a prediction, and experimentalist E has set up the apparatus to test it using the arrangement in Fig. 2(c). Suppose a second theorist, T*, carries out calculations using the incompatible family E1 instead. Will this alter what is going on inside the box? Obviously not; E's confirmation of T's prediction will be entirely unaffected by T*'s calculation! On the other hand, T* will, if he limits himself to E1 , be unable to provide a coherent account of how E's measurement confirms T's prediction. In order to do that, T* needs to employ E2 . If he does so, he will, of course, obtain the same result as T. On the other hand, if T* can persuade E to carry out an alternative experiment using the arrangement of Fig. 2(b)--this cannot, of course, be done at the same time as the experiment in Fig. 2(c), but might be done later using a second photon--then this, or at least a sufficient number of experiments of this type, will confirm T*'s result, a situation which T can understand if he, too, employs E1 . As well as showing that the choice of framework does not imply some mysterious influence of mind upon matter, this example illustrates some other aspects of quantum reality as viewed using consistent histories. The existence of a choice of framework does not render quantum theory subjective, for if T and T* adopt the same framework, they come to the same conclusion. Predictions of what is going on in a quantum system can, in principle, be checked experimentally; the theorist's freedom to choose a framework merely means that alternative experimental arrangements are needed to check predictions made using different frameworks. Objective descriptions (in the sense just discussed), experimental confirmation, and the absence of peculiar influences of mind over matter are aspects of traditional realism which continue to hold true in the quantum realm if we accept the results of consistent histories. But there is also something very different: one cannot simultaneously employ E2 and E1 for describing what is going on in the closed box. Not because using one of them makes the other false, but because there is no way of combining the results from the two incompatible families. Thus a "unicity" always present in classical physics, the ability to combine any two descriptions of the same system in a single description, is absent in quantum theory. If one wishes to maintain that this unicity is truly indispensable to realism, then, obviously, 19

consistent history quantum theory cannot be said to be "realistic". The alternative, which of course I favor, is to include quantum incompatibility as part of our understanding of what quantum reality is all about, and why it differs from what reality was thought to be like before the advent of quantum theory.

Is consistent histories a predictive theory?

As the result of a detailed study [16, 17], Dowker and Kent conclude that the consistent history approach to quantum theory lacks predictive power, and for this reason is not satisfactory as a fundamental scientific theory. They accept the idea that once a consistent family ("consistent set" in their terminology) is specified, one and only one of the corresponding elementary histories will take place, and quantum theory can only assign a probability to the different possibilities. That the theory is probabilistic in this sense is not what concerns them. Rather, it is the fact that the consistent history approach, as a fundamental theory, treats all frameworks or consistent families "democratically", and provides no criterion to select out one in particular. In other words, there is no "law of nature" which specifies the framework. Thus, from their perspective, there is no way of calculating probabilities of specific histories, since probabilities cannot be computed without using some framework, and the theory does not tell one which framework to use. Both CHQR and the present paper agree with Dowker and Kent that consistent histories, as a fundamental theory of nature, does not single out a particular framework. The difference is that Dowker and Kent regard this situation as unsatisfactory, whereas from the perspective presented here there does not seem to be any problem if one regards the physicist's choice of framework to be like the draftsman's choice of a perspective for representing a threedimensional object, or like the choice of a coarse graining of classical phase space. That is, the choice is dictated by the problems which the physicist seeks to address, the questions he is attempting to answer, and not by some law of nature. Given some question of physical interest, quantum incompatibility severely limits the choice, as noted in the case of the specific example in Sec. II, and discussed further in Sec. IV. There seems to be no reason why an element of choice of this type should render a theory unsatisfactory. It may not agree with certain aesthetic criteria for what constitutes "good science", but such criteria tend to be somewhat subjective, as in the case of Einstein's preference for a deterministic rather than a probabilistic quantum theory. Insofar as Dowker and Kent regard the choice of framework as being a choice among mutually exclusive alternatives, which seems to be their perspective in Sec. 5.6 of [17], their point of view is quite different from that presented above in Sec. IV: that if two frameworks are compatible, the relationship between them is analogous to that between classical coarse grainings, and if they are incompatible, in the quantum sense of that term, it is still not correct to suppose that the use of one framework excludes the other in the same way that employing one trajectory in a classical phase space excludes all other trajectories. Thus one should never think of one framework as "correct" and another as "incorrect", other than in a sense like "this is the correct framework to address the problem which I have in mind". A particular instance of the lack of predictive power, according to Dowker and Kent, is that consistent history quantum theory cannot answer the question, "Will the world be quasiclassical tomorrow?" See CHQR, Sec. VII B, for a discussion of quasiclassicality in 20

relationship to the ideas considered here. The term "quasiclassical" is somewhat vague, but the essence of Dowker and Kent's concern lies in the fact that the consistent histories formalism does not rule out the possibility of MQS states. In particular there are families in which only "normal" (non-MQS) states occur up to some particular time, and MQS states appear at later times, so that "quasiclassical" behavior up to some time is no guarantee that it will continue. The example in Sec. II can serve to illustrate this point. Family F1 contains the "nonquasiclassical" MQS state S at t2 , whereas F2 has "normal" detector states C  D and CD ; at the earlier times t0 and t1 these families are identical, and the coherent superposition state s of the photon at time t1 , because it is easily achieved and detected in the laboratory, can be considered compatible with a "quasiclassical" description. The consistent history approach gives no reason to choose F2 rather than F1 to represent the state of affairs at t2 . On the other hand, as pointed out in Sec. IV, a question of the form "will the system be in S, or will it be in one of the two states C  D or CD at t2 ?" is not meaningful, because it requires, at least implicitly, a comparison between mutually incompatible alternatives, and quantum incompatibility implies that no such comparison is possible, that is, it does not make sense. It is like asking, "does the spin half particle have an x or a z component of angular momentum?" Note that "quasiclassical", interpreted as "non-MQS", is not a quantum mechanical property as such, since it is not associated with a subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. Thus while both |C  D and |CD in the example of Sec. II refer to non-MQS states, the smallest subspace which contains them also contains the MQS state |S . This suggests that "quasiclassical" is best thought of as a term belonging to the metalanguage of quantum descriptions, the language used to discuss these descriptions, rather than as a term which can itself enter into a quantum description. To use a classical analogy, the term "large cells" could be employed to characterize a coarse graining of a classical phase space, and it belongs to the metalanguage, for it obviously is not correct to think of "large cells" as a property of the physical system itself. The question "will the world be quasiclassical tomorrow?" is thus comparable to "will tomorrow's coarse graining use large cells?". Both might make sense as part of a discussion among physicists as to how to construct a description of a physical system which best addresses the problems which interest them; neither refers directly to properties of the system being described. To summarize, while it makes sense to compute probabilities of different histories given a quasiclassical framework, it does not make sense to assign a probability to such a framework, or treat it as one of a collection of mutually exclusive physical alternatives. Quasiclassicality is a property of quantum descriptions, not a property of quantum systems, and the question "is this quantum system quasiclassical?" is not meaningful, at least when understood in the same sense as "is the energy between 9 and 10 ergs?". For the same reason, quasiclassicality cannot be a condition in a quantum probability, which is why a recent argument by Kent, examined in App. B, is inconsistent with the rules of quantum reasoning given in CHQR. Despite the obvious differences between the present paper and the approach of Dowker and Kent, there is a sense in which the conclusions complement each other. By studying the structure of consistent histories under the assumption that alternative consistent families are somewhat analogous to the mutually exclusive possibilities represented by a sample space, Dowker and Kent concluded that this approach does not result in a satisfactory scientific 21

theory. That is perfectly compatible with the perspective of the present paper. A rather different approach to consistent histories was considered by Dowker and Kent in Sec. 5.4 of [17] under the title "many histories". See the following section for some comments.

VD

List of histories

Given any consistent family of histories for a particular system, one and only one of the elementary histories will actually occur. This statement makes it tempting to suppose that it is possible to construct a list {Fj , Fj } which assigns to every consistent family Fj a history Fj , understood as the history which actually occurred in a particular system or a particular realization of an experiment. This temptation should be resisted; no such list exists, at least if it is interpreted in the manner just suggested. Note that if the Fj are alternative coarse grainings of a classical phase space, the existence of such a list is not in doubt, for one simply takes whatever classical trajectory actually occurs, and employs it to generate the history Fj by noting which cell of Fj is occupied by the trajectory at each time. In the same way, if the quantum list contains only consistent families which are mutually compatible with one another, the list can be constructed by using the common refinement. When, however, incompatible families occur in the list--as will necessarily be the case if all consistent families are included--the quantum list does not make sense. Consider the example in Sec. II. For F1 there is only one history, (6), with positive weight, which must therefore be F1 . For F2 there are two histories with positive weights, (11), so F2 must be one of these. But whichever it is, it makes no sense to say that a single system (and a single experimental run) can be correctly described by both F1 and F2 , since at t2 the detectors cannot be said to be in the MQS state S and also in one of the states C  D or CD . To be sure, one might adopt an alternative interpretation of the list {Fj , Fj }, and understand it as referring to what happens in distinct but nominally identical systems, or in successive repetitions of an experiment, labeled by the subscript j. In such a case there is no problem, for it is not necessary to use the same framework every time an experiment is carried out, or for describing different systems. But this is obviously a very different interpretation of the list from that employed above. Dowker and Kent's "many histories" interpretation, Sec. 5.4 of [17], involves such a list, although their interpretation of what it means is not very clear. If it is thought of as applying to a single system, or a single universe, then at least from the perspective adopted in this paper, it does not make much (quantum mechanical) sense. It is only fair to add that Dowker and Kent themselves show very little enthusiasm for their "many histories" interpretation .

App. A. Consistent Histories and Contrary Inferences
In a recent article [19], Kent has stated that the consistent history approach cannot be taken seriously as a fundamental theory because it allows for what he calls "contrary inferences". We shall show that the problem is not with consistent histories quantum theory as presented in CHQR and the present paper, but rather with Kent's definition of "contrary", which fails to take proper account of quantum incompatibility when it arises from violations of consistency conditions. The Aharonov-Vaidman [29] example discussed in CHQR Sec. VI D can be used to illustrate the central point of Kent's argument. A particle can be in one of three states |A , |B , or |C , and the dynamics is trivial: |A  |A , etc. Define   (29) | = (|A + |B + |C )/ 3, | = (|A + |B - |C )/ 3, and (consistent with previous notation) let a letter outside a ket denote the corresponding projector, and a tilde its complement, thus: A = |A A|, ~ A = I - A = B + C, (30)

etc. Define a consistent family A of histories starting with  at time t0 , followed by A or ~ A at a later time t1 , and  at a still later time t2 . It is straightforward to show, using this framework, that Pr(A1 | 0  2 ) = 1, (31) where the subscripts indicate the time associated with the corresponding event. That is, we can be sure that the particle was in state A at t1 , given the initial state  at t0 and the final state  at t2 . An alternative framework B, incompatible with A, uses the same events at t0 ~ and t2 , and B and B at t1 . Using B, one finds Pr(B1 | 0  2 ) = 1. Kent defines two projectors A and B to be "contrary" provided AB = BA = 0, ~ A = B, (33) (32)

~ and employs the term "contradictory" when A = B. Since A and B in the AharonovVaidman example satisfy (33), Kent would conclude that (31) and (32) are two probabilityone inferences based on the same data, 0  2 , to two contrary events, and he finds this feature of the consistent history approach to be problematical. To analyze this argument, we first note that the term contrary has a well-defined usage in classical logic [30], where it indicates the relationship between two propositions which cannot both be true, but might both be false. "The queen is in London" and "the queen is in Cambridge" are contrary propositions in this sense: they are mutually exclusive, so they cannot both be true, but they could both be false (if the queen is in some other city). Similarly, contradictory is reserved for the relationship of two propositions which cannot both be true, and also cannot both be false. For example, "the queen is in London" is false if and only if "the queen is not in London" is true, and vice versa. 23

Translating terms from classical logic into appropriate quantum counterparts is not a trivial exercise; see CHQR and Sec. IV of the present paper. As long as A and B belong to the same consistent family, (33) is a reasonable quantum counterpart for the classical term "contrary", and agrees with the rules worked out in CHQR. The problem with Kent's argument is that he wishes to apply the same definition in a case in which A and B do not belong to the same consistent family. In the Aharonov-Vaidman example, B is incompatible, in the quantum mechanical sense (Sec. IV) with the family A used to obtain (31), while A is incompatible with the family B used to obtain (32). When quantum incompatibility obtains, the consistent history approach, for reasons indicated in Sec. IV, disallows any logical comparison whatsoever. Thus as long as one is considering inferences based upon the data 0  2 , A and B are best thought of as "incomparable", and speaking of them as "contrary" in a sense similar to that used in classical logic is misleading. To put the matter in another way, in order to be able to say that A and B are contrary in the sense of classical logic, consistent history rules require that they belong to the same framework. However, any framework which contains both A and B at t1 cannot also contain both  at t0 and  at t2 . Consequently, in a framework in which it would be correct to say that A and B are contrary, neither of the inferences (31) and (32) is possible. So, whichever way one looks at the matter, there are no "contrary inferences". The key point is that consistent history reasoning, as clearly stated by Omn`s [31] and reiterated in CHQR, must e employ a single framework, and Kent's argument violates this rule through defining [32] "contrary" in a manner which allows it to hold as a relationship between propositions which are not members of a single framework. The same point can be made in a slightly different way. In Sec. II we exhibited two probability one inferences, in (17) and (18), based upon identical conditions but carried out in two incompatible families, F3 and F2 . The nonsensical result (19) of combining these two inferences was blocked by the consistent history rule that results deduced in incompatible families cannot be combined. It is precisely this same rule which applies in the case of (31) and (32). The only difference is that while a quantum comparison of c and s from (17) and (18) is obviously nonsensical, because the projectors do not commute, that of A and B as inferred in (31) and (32) is not as transparently incorrect, since the projectors commute, even though one has an equally serious violation of precisely the same consistent history rule. Note that quantum incompatibility can arise in the consistent histories approach both because certain projectors do not commute and because consistency rules are violated. The incompatibility of A with B, and of B with A, is of the latter type, which is why it is a bit less evident than the incompatibility of c and s in the example of Sec. II. In summary, to say that A and B are "contrary" in a logical sense when they belong to incompatible frameworks is a violation of one of the basic principles of consistent history reasoning, at least as the subject has been developed up to now. To be sure, there may exist alternative approaches to consistent histories based upon a different sent of logical rules, and one might view Kent's argument as, in effect, proposing such an alternative. In that case there would be no reason to disagree with his conclusion, which would be that this alternative proposal constitutes a formalism which cannot be taken seriously as a fundamental theory of nature, for precisely the reasons which he points out. Finally, a comment on a question Kent raises towards the end of [19], as to why "contrary" and "contradictory" projectors, as he defines them, seem to enter the consistent history 24

formalism (as developed by Omn`s and in CHQR) in a somewhat different way. The brief e answer is that neither "contrary" nor "contradictory" can be defined as logical relationships unless both of the properties (or histories) being compared are found in the same consistent family. The rules for constructing such families given explicitly in CHQR require that the Boolean event algebra contain the identity, and hence if it contains some projector it also contains its negation. This appears to be the source of the asymmetry between Kent's "contrary" and "contradictory". Alternative rules for these Boolean algebras might well be possible, but until they are discovered, there seems no reason to replace them with something less satisfactory.

App. B. Conditioning Upon Quasiclassicality
Kent has claimed that even if one assumes that the world will be quasiclassical tomorrow, the consistent history approach does not always yield probabilistic predictions which agree with those provided by Copenhagen (i.e., standard textbook) quantum theory. The following example illustrates his argument, and shows why it cannot be considered a serious objection to consistent histories as described in CHQR and the present paper. Suppose the beamsplitter in the example in Sec. II (Fig 1) is replaced by one which produces beams in three exit channels c, d, and e, corresponding to a unitary time development  |a  (|c + |d + |e )/ 3 (34) in place of (1). A third detector E is added for the e channel, so that |e |E  |E  (35)

in addition to (2). We now consider two consistent families involving two times, t0 and t2 : D1 : D2 : 0  {C  DE, CD E, CDE  }, 0  {SE, CDE  }, (36) (37)

where the initial state (the counterpart of (4)) is |0 = |aCDE , (38)

|S is the MQS combination of |C  D and |D  C defined in (5), and the curly brackets in (36) and (37) enclose alternative possibilities at t2 . As usual, various histories of zero weight have been omitted. A straightforward analysis using D1 yields Pr(C  DE | 0 ) = Pr(CD E | 0 ) = Pr(CDE  | 0 ) = 1/3, (39)

that is, the probability is 1/3 that each of the detectors will have detected the photon, whereas from D2 one concludes that Pr(SE | 0 ) = 2/3, Pr(CDE  | 0 ) = 1/3. 25 (40)

The fact that Pr(CDE  | 0 ) is the same in both cases reflects a general property of the consistent histories approach, as noted in Sec. II. Kent would accept (39) and (40) as correct, but would then argue that if one conditions upon quasiclassicality, the probability that E detects the photon is different in families D1 and D2 ; to be specific: D1 : D2 : Pr(CDE  | 0  quasiclassical) = 1/3, Pr(CDE  | 0  quasiclassical) = 1. (41) (42)

The argument is that all three histories in D1 are quasiclassical (no MQS states), and thus each has a probability 1/3, whether or not one conditions upon quasiclassicality. On the other hand, in D2 the only quasiclassical history is 0  CDE  , since the other involves the far-from-classical superposition S, and thus conditioning upon quasiclassicality yields (42) in place of (40). The problem with this argument, if one adopts the point of view of CHQR, is that conditional probabilities are only defined when their arguments are projectors belonging to an appropriate Boolean algebra satisfying consistency conditions. But, as noted in Sec. V C, there is no subspace of the Hilbert space, and hence no projector, corresponding to "quasiclassical", understood in the present context as "non-MQS". Thus the conditional probabilities (41) and (42) are undefined, and no argument based upon them can be valid. Is there some way to define "quasiclassical" as a condition entering into a probability without referring to a subspace of the Hilbert space? If, as suggested in Sec. V C, the term "quasiclassical" belongs to the metalanguage rather than the language of quantum descriptions, such a definition would change the meaning of the resulting probabilities in an important way. Thus imagine that D1 and D2 were two coarse grainings of a classical phase space using cells of different sizes. Then by conditioning upon the initial condition and the fact that the history only involves, say, large cells, one could produce a difference analogous to that between (41) and (42). But the result would obviously have no direct physical significance, although it might be useful in addressing the question of which coarse graining is most useful for a numerical simulation. Of course, there may be some alternative to CHQR in which "quasiclassical" refers directly to a quantum property. In that case, Kent's argument would show that this alternative suffers from serious problems of internal consistency.

Because the settings represent macroscopically distinct situations, the two apparatus states (viewed as quantum states) are orthogonal, and the measurement on the spin half particle is then used to try and infer something about the apparatus states. 27

Choice of Consistent Family, and Quantum Incompatibility
Robert B. Griffiths Department of Physics Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213, U.S.A. In consistent history quantum theory, a description of the time development of a quantum system requires choosing a framework or consistent family, and then calculating probabilities for the different histories which it contains. It is argued that the framework is chosen by the physicist constructing a description of a quantum system on the basis of questions he wishes to address, in a manner analogous to choosing a coarse graining of the phase space in classical statistical mechanics. The choice of framework is not determined by some law of nature, though it is limited by quantum incompatibility, a concept which is discussed using a two-dimensional Hilbert space (spin half particle). Thus certain questions of physical interest can only be addressed using frameworks in which they make (quantum mechanical) sense. The physicist's choice does not influence reality, nor does the presence of choices render the theory subjective. On the contrary, predictions of the theory can, in principle, be verified by experimental measurements. These considerations are used to address various criticisms and possible misunderstandings of the consistent history approach, including its predictive power, whether it requires a new logic, whether it can be interpreted realistically, the nature of "quasiclassicality", and the possibility of "contrary" inferences.
I. INTRODUCTION

arXiv:quant-ph/9708028v2 31 Dec 1998

The consistent history approach [1­7] to quantum theory provides a precise conceptual framework for describing how a closed quantum system (isolated from its environment, or with the environment itself included as part of a single closed system) develops in time. It reproduces the results of standard textbook quantum theory while avoiding the wellknown paradoxes associated with the "measurement problem", Bell's inequality, and the like [7,8]. It shows promise for application to quantum optics [9], quantum computing [10] and quantum cryptography [11]. At the same time, the consistent history approach has been the subject of various criticisms [12­20] which center upon the fact that the formalism allows the physicist to choose from a very large number of alternative frameworks or consistent families of histories, all of which are considered "equally valid" in the sense that no fundamental physical law determines which family should be used in any given case. Were this "freedom of choice" the counterpart of gauge symmetry in classical electromagnetism, it would be of no concern. However, different frameworks are often mutually incompatible in a manner which means

that the use of one to describe a given physical system precludes the use of another, that certain questions can only be addressed if one uses the appropriate framework, and that results from incompatible frameworks cannot be combined to form a single quantum description. The resulting conceptual problems have given rise to the claim that consistent history quantum theory is incomplete and lacking in predictive power [16,17], that it is logically incoherent and incompatible with physical realism [12­15], or that the physicist's choice (within this interpretation of quantum theory) must necessarily influence reality [12,15]. While all of these claims can be countered by a detailed analysis based upon consistent history principles, as we shall see below, the fact that they have been made by scientists who have studied consistent histories in some detail means that the conceptual problems which give rise to them are likely to trouble others as well. Hence the present paper contains a detailed examination of these problems, using a systematic formulation of the consistent history approach published under the title "Consistent histories and quantum reasoning", hereafter referred to as CHQR [7]. Indeed, the arguments presented below are a continuation of a discussion already begun in CHQR as to how the formal principles of consistent history quantum theory, which appear to be sound, should be understood in physical terms and applied in particular situations. The basic conclusion of the present paper is that the criticisms mentioned above do not indicate any deficiency or lack of logical coherence in the consistent history approach, once it is properly understood. Instead, the main problem is that the full import of the "single consistent family" condition, which prohibits combining results from incompatible families, has not always been appreciated, despite the fact that it was stated in the very first publication devoted to consistent histories [21], and has been repeated many times since [22]. In addition, even physicists who accept the usual Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics often adopt, without giving the matter enough thought, a mode of reasoning about its physical consequences which is in basic conflict with the underlying mathematics. A consequence is that one of the few interpretations of quantum theory constructed in such a way that its rules of reasoning are consistent with Hilbert space mathematics is criticized for being logically incoherent! The structure of this paper is as follows. Section II contains a brief review of the principles of consistent history reasoning as found in CHQR, followed by applications of these principles to a simple gedanken experiment. Various consistent families, or frameworks, which are incompatible with each other are constructed, and it is shown how they can be used to derive a variety of physical conclusions. The problems of choice and of incompatibility emerging from this example are summarized at the end of the section. The analysis of these two problems begins with a discussion of various classical analogies, in Sec. III. Here it is argued that the choice of a quantum framework is, among other things, like the choice of a coarse graining for a classical phase space, and hence can properly be considered a choice made by the physicist, not a consequence of some "law of nature". However, incompatibility between frameworks is a quantum effect with no good classical analog, and must be dealt with in quantum terms. This is the topic of Sec. IV, in which properties of a spin half particle are used as a sort of quantum analogy in order to discuss general properties of quantum incompatibility. In addition, a simple example shows how the predictions of consistent histories for what goes on in a closed quantum system can, in principle, be confirmed by experimental measurements. Section V begins with a summary of the conclusions which can be drawn from the preced2

ing arguments, and then continues with some applications to various criticisms and (actual or potential) misunderstandings of the consistent history approach. These include the question of whether consistent histories requires a new form of logic, whether it can be interpreted in a realistic sense, a reply to the claim that the consistent history approach lacks predictive power, comments on the nature of "quasiclassicality", and reasons why there cannot be a "list of true histories". The appendices contain somewhat more technical arguments which address recent claims that consistent history quantum mechanics allows "contrary inferences" [19,20], and that it cannot reproduce consequences of standard quantum mechanics even if the future is thought to be "quasiclassical" [18].
II. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF QUANTUM REASONING

The basic structure needed in order to treat quantum mechanics as a probabilistic theory is the same as for all other types of probabilistic reasoning: a sample space of mutually exclusive elementary events, one and only one of which occurs. These "events" in the quantum case are elementary histories; see Sec. II below for some examples. They are analogous to the classical histories obtained by flipping a coin several times in a row. For example, the sample space for a coin flipped three times in a row consists of eight sequences, HHH, HHT, . . . TTT, (H=heads, T=tails), one and only one of which is actually realized when the experiment is carried out. Compound events, which are collections of elementary events, together with the elementary events themselves, constitute the Boolean event algebra to which probabilities are assigned. (In the example of coin flipping just mentioned, the four sequences corresponding to "H on the first toss" are a compound event.) In the quantum case, the algebra of events is called a consistent family or framework. It must be chosen according to appropriate quantum mechanical rules, as discussed in CHQR. Provided these rules are satisfied, probabilities are assigned using a set of non-negative weights calculated from the unitary time evolution engendered by Schr¨dinger's equation. Given these probabilities, the physical o consequences of the theory, typically in the form of conditional probabilities, are calculated following precisely the same rules as in other applications of standard probability theory. The peculiar features of quantum theory come about from the fact that there are usually a large number of different ways of choosing the sample space or consistent family, and it is necessary to pay careful attention to which of these is being used to study a particular problem. In classical physics it usually suffices to consider a single sample space, and in those instances in which more than one is used, relating the different sample spaces is relatively straightforward, unlike quantum theory, where the rules are more complicated. For further details, see CHQR. A simple example which will serve to illustrate the principles of quantum reasoning just discussed is shown in Fig. 1. A photon which is initially in channel a passes through a beamsplitter B and is later detected by one of two detectors, C and D. The unitary time evolution produced by the beamsplitter takes the form  |a  |s = (|c + |d )/ 2, (2.1) where |a is a wave packet for the photon in the entrance channel a, |c and |d are wave 3

packets in the exit channels c and d, and |s is a coherent superposition of the latter. The interaction of the photon with each of the detectors is given by the unitary transformations |c |C  |C  , |d |D  |D  , (2.2)

where |C indicates a detector in a state ready to detect a photon, and |C  the state which results when the photon is detected. Note that |C and |C  differ from each other in some macroscopic, visible property; for example, the position of a pointer. The states |D and |D  of the other detector have a similar interpretation. Some other particle, such as a neutron, could replace the photon without altering the following discussion in any significant way. Or one could imagine a spin-half particle going through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus which separates an Sx = 1/2 initial state into two beams with Sz = 1/2 and Sz = -1/2 directed to separate detectors. In the consistent history approach, the photon and the detectors are thought of as forming a single, closed quantum system, and the quantum mechanical description applies to the system as a whole. (In principle the beam splitter should also be included, but since its quantum state plays no role in the following discussion, it is omitted so as not to clutter up the notation.) The unitary time development of the total system then takes the form |0  |s CD  |S , where |0 = |aCD , (2.4) (2.3)

the initial state at a time t0 , evolves under the action of Schr¨dinger's equation to a state o |s CD at a time t1 when the photon has passed through the beam splitter, and then to  |S = (|C  D + |CD )/ 2 (2.5) at a time t2 after the photon has been detected by one of the detectors. Since |C  and |C are macroscopically distinguishable, as are also |D and |D  , |S is a macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) or "Schr¨dinger's cat" state. o One can think of (2.3) as a quantum history based upon the three times t0 , t1 , and t2 . In the notation of CHQR it is represented as a projector 0  s CD  S (2.6)

on the tensor product space of histories, where we adopt the convention, here and below, that a symbol outside a ket denotes the corresponding projector, for example, S = |S S|. (2.7)

For present purposes the tensor product structure is not important, and (2.6) should simply be thought of as a statement that the system started off in the initial state 0 (or |0 ) at t0 , was in a state s CD at t1 , and in the state S at time t2 . The consistent history approach supports such a "realistic" interpretation for reasons indicated in CHQR and in Sec. IV C below. 4

The first consistent family or framework F1 we shall discuss has a sample space of elementary families consisting of (2.6) together with three additional histories ~ 0  s CD  S, 0  (I - s CD)  S, ~ S = I - S, ~ 0  (I - s CD)  S, (2.8)

where I is the identity operator on the Hilbert space, and (2.9)

is the negation of S, and means "S did not occur". The four projectors in (2.6) and (2.8) are the elementary histories which constitute the sample space of F1 . (They sum to 0 rather than to the history space identity because we regard F1 , along with the families we shall consider later, as having a fixed initial event; see remarks towards the end of Sec. III in CHQR.) However, quantum theory assigns a weight of zero to the histories in (2.8), which means they are dynamically impossible, and have zero probability to occur. When discussing other families, we will usually not display the zero-weight histories explicitly. Because the sample space has only one history, (2.6), with finite weight, we can infer that Pr(S2 | 0 ) = 1, (2.10)

where the subscripts, in this and later formulas, always refer to the times at which the events occur: S2 is a shorthand for "S at time t2 ". Thus, given that the system was in the state |0 at t0 , it will certainly (with probability 1) be in the state |S at time t2 . As is well known, unitary time evolution of this sort is something of an embarrassment for standard quantum mechanics, because physicists typically prefer to draw the conclusion that at time t2 the system is in one of the two states |C  D or |CD , each with a certain probability, rather than in the hard-to-interpret MQS state |S . The endless discussions about how to interpret the state |S and resolve the corresponding "measurement" problem have been rightly criticized by Bell [23]. The consistent history solution to this measurement problem is to introduce a distinct consistent family F2 based upon a sample space of elementary histories 0  s CD  C  D, 0  s CD  CD , (2.11) ~ together with others of zero weight, such as 0  s CD  C  D. The physical interpretation of the first history in (2.11) is as follows: At t0 the photon was in state |a and the detectors were ready, at t1 the photon was in |s and the detectors remained in the ready state, whereas at t2 detector C had detected the photon, while D was still in its ready state, indicating that it had not detected the photon. The second history in (2.11) has the same interpretation with the roles of C and D interchanged. A straightforward application of the rules for calculating probabilities given in CHQR yields the results
  Pr(C2 | 0 ) = 1/2 = Pr(D2 | 0 ),

(2.12)

where, once again, the subscript 2 indicates an event at the time t2 . In words, (2.12) tells us that, given the initial state |0 at t0 , at time t2 the probability is 1/2 that detector C 5

will have detected the photon, and 1/2 that it will have been detected by D. Similarly, one can show that
  Pr(C2  D2 | 0 ) = 1,   Pr(C2  D2 | 0 ) = 0,

(2.13)

where "" stands for (non exclusive) "or", and "" means "and". That is, at t2 it is certain (probability one) that one or the other of the detectors has detected the photon, and it is not true (because the probability is 0) that both detectors have detected the photon. Thus by using family F2 , the consistent history approach provides a definite, albeit probabilistic, answer to the question "which detector detected the photon?", and this is the answer which everyone who uses standard quantum theory agrees is correct. Notice that this is done without the MQS state |S ever entering the discussion and causing the sort of confusion pointed out by Bell [23]. Indeed, according to consistent history rules, |S at time t2 cannot enter a discussion based upon F2 , because it is incompatible with the histories in F2 in the sense that it cannot be added to F2 without violating the rules for constructing quantum event algebras. In particular, the event algebra must be a Boolean algebra of projectors, and the projector S does commute with either C  D or CD , so cannot be part of a Boolean algebra which contains the latter. Combining any discussion of |S at time t2 with F2 violates the single framework rule of quantum reasoning, CHQR Sec. III. For the very same reason, it is impossible to include either C  or D  at time t2 in family F1 , and hence, if one employs F1 , one cannot, according to the rules of consistent history quantum theory, address the question of which detector has detected the particle. Such a discussion is "meaningless" in the technical sense that this interpretation of quantum theory assigns it no meaning. In the consistent history approach one cannot interpret |S to mean "|C  D or |CD for all practical purposes", or for any other purposes. Quantum incompatibility is also the reason why we cannot combine (2.10) with (2.12) to reach the conclusion
 Pr(S2  C2 | 0 ) = 1/2,

(2.14)

a result which would follow immediately by standard probabilistic reasoning from (2.10) and (2.12) if these probabilities were based upon the same sample space. But the sample spaces for F1 and F2 are distinct, and they cannot be combined to form a common sample space. This is a typical quantum mechanical effect which serves to define when two consistent families are mutually incompatible. Consequently, the left side of (2.14) is meaningless, and assigning it the value 1/2, or any other value, is a logical error. Now consider a third family of histories F3 based on a sample space containing two histories of finite weight, 0  c  C  , 0  d  D  , (2.15)

together with additional histories of zero weight. (The projectors at t1 and t2 in the histories in (2.15), unlike those in (2.11), do not project onto pure states. However, one could replace c with c CD, C  with C  D, etc. without altering the following discussion.) The family F3 is obviously incompatible with F2 because the projectors c and d at t1 do not commute with s, and it is obviously incompatible with F1 for the same reason, and also because of the detector states at t2 . 6

The conditional probabilities (2.12) can be derived in F3 as well as in F2 ; this reflects a very general result (CHQR Sec. IV) that conditional probabilities of this type always have the same values in any framework in which they can be defined, whether or not the frameworks are incompatible. In addition, in F3 (but not F2 ) one has Pr(c1 | 0 ) = 1/2 = Pr(d1 | 0 ), (2.16) a sort of microscopic analog of (2.12). In words, given the initial state at t0 , one can conclude that at time t1 the photon will be either in the c channel with probability 1/2, or in the d channel with the same probability. Note that these probabilities, unlike those of standard textbook quantum theory, make no reference to measurements, which only take place some time later. That later measurements yield corresponding probabilities, (2.12), is perfectly consistent with the general principle, see Sec. IV D, that the probabilities assigned to events and histories by the consistent history approach can always be checked, in principle, using suitable (idealized) measurements. (Measurements play no distinguished role in consistent history quantum mechanics; if a closed quantum system contains some measuring apparatus, the events involving the apparatus are analyzed in precisely the same way as all other events.) Both (2.12) and (2.16) can be obtained by straightforward application of the Born rule of standard quantum theory (although its use in (2.16) might be regarded as problematical by some practitioners, since no measurement is involved). But the next result,
 Pr(c1 | 0  C2 ) = 1,  Pr(d1 | 0  C2 ) = 0,

(2.17)

goes beyond anything one can calculate with the Born rule. It says that given the initial state, and the fact that at t2 it was detector C which detected the photon, one can be certain that at time t1 the photon was in the c channel and not in the d channel. Given the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, this is a very reasonable result, and shows another way in which consistent history methods make sense out of quantum measurements. That appropriate measurements will reveal properties a measured system had before it interacted with the apparatus is a principle used constantly in the design of experimental equipment, and the inability of standard textbook quantum mechanics to explain this is a defect just as serious as its inability to deal with Schr¨dinger's cat. o Notice that the result just discussed can be obtained using F3 , but not F2 or F1 . The question "was the photon in c or d at time t1 ?" is not meaningful in F1 and F2 because the projectors c and d needed to answer it are incompatible with these families. On the other hand, if we use F2 we can derive the result
 Pr(s1 | 0  C2 ) = 1.

(2.18)

That is, under the same conditions as in (2.17), one can conclude with certainty that at time t1 , the particle was in the superposition state |s defined in (2.1). Just as in the case of (2.10) and (2.12) discussed earlier, because (2.17) and (2.18) were derived in two incompatible families, they cannot be combined to reach the nonsensical conclusion
 Pr(c1  s1 | 0  C2 ) = 1,

(2.19)

which, were it correct, would be the analog of asserting that a spin half particle has both Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2 at the same time. 7

In summary, we have studied the gedanken experiment shown in Fig 1 using three separate and mutually incompatible frameworks or consistent families, F1 , F2 , and F3 , each based upon its own sample space of histories involving events at the three times t0 , t1 , and t2 , and have derived a number of different (probabilistic) conclusions. There are many (in fact, an uncountably infinite number of) other frameworks which could have been employed to discuss the same situation. The fact that the same physical system can be discussed using many different frameworks gives rise to the problem of choice: how does one decide which framework is appropriate for describing what goes on in this closed quantum system? A partial answer is suggested by the fact that certain questions of physical interest, such as "which detector detected the photon?", and "which channel was the photon in before it was detected?" can be addressed in certain families but not in other families, because the projectors needed to provide a quantum mechanical representation of the question are only compatible with certain families. Thus incompatibility serves to limit choice, but at the same time it gives rise to the problem of incompatibility: how are we to understand the existence of, and the relationship among incompatible histories and families? These two problems will be discussed in the following sections, beginning with classical analogies in Sec. III, which will help us understand something of what is involved in choosing a quantum framework. Unfortunately, there is no good classical analog of quantum incompatibility, so the discussion of this concept in Sec. IV is based upon simple quantum examples. Combining the results from these two sections leads to the conclusions stated in Part A of Sec. V.
III. CLASSICAL ANALOGIES

No classical analogy is fully adequate for understanding the implications of quantum theory, which must, in the end, be considered on its own terms. Nevertheless, classical ideas can be extremely helpful in suggesting fruitful ways to think about quantum principles. This is particularly true for the problem of choice, where classical analogies suggest (though they obviously cannot prove) that the freedom a physicist has in choosing a framework does not render the resulting theory unscientific or lacking in objectivity, nor does it mean that the physicist's choice somehow "influences reality". As a first analogy, consider a professional historian composing a history of Great Britain. Obviously, as a practical matter, he must choose to emphasize certain subjects and ignore, or at least give much less consideration, to others. The choice of topics is determined by what interests the historian (or perhaps the pressures on his professional career), and are not the consequence of some "law of history". Nor does his choice have any influence on historical events (at least those occurring prior to when his work is published). Nevertheless, the account he produces, if he does his job well, is not a purely subjective one, and other historians dealing with the same subject matter ought to concur about the historical facts, even if they disagree, as they surely will, about their significance. A second analogy is provided by a draftsman producing a representation of a threedimensional object on a two-dimensional piece of paper. In order to do this, he has to choose some perspective from which to view (or imagine viewing) the object. This choice is not determined by any "law of representation", though it can be influenced by pragmatic 8

considerations: some things can be better represented using one perspective than another. Nor, obviously, does the choice influence the object itself, although it constrains the amount and type of descriptive information which can be included in the drawing. The choice of gauge in classical electromagnetism provides a third analogy. This choice is a matter of convenience which obviously does not influence the system being described. In addition, the same physical conclusions can be drawn using any gauge, so the choice is based entirely on pragmatic considerations. To be sure, this is different from what encounters in the case of quantum families, since, as noted repeatedly for the example in Sec. II, the topics one can discuss, and thus the conclusions one can draw, do depend upon which family is employed. Nonetheless, a particular conditional probability can often be calculated in many different families, and in all families in which it can be calculated it has the same value. Thus, for example, (2.12) can be obtained using either F2 or F3 , though not F1 . Hence, relative to a particular conditional probability, the choice among the families in which it can be computed is similar to the choice of a gauge. Classical Hamiltonian mechanics, which describes a mechanical system with N degrees of freedom by means of a 2N-dimensional phase space , provides a fourth analogy. To be sure, once the phase space and the Hamiltonian have been specified, the only remaining choice is that of the appropriate phase space trajectory or orbit, (t), and this is typically made by assuming that the state  of the system is known at some time, say t = 0. While this choice bears some resemblance to the quantum choice problem, the disanalogies outnumber the positive analogies. Thus in the quantum case, with the exception of histories involving only one time, there is always more than one family consistent with a specification of the quantum state at an initial time. This reflects the fact that quantum mechanics is a stochastic theory, unlike classical mechanics, which is deterministic. In addition, the choice between classical trajectories is a choice between mutually exclusive alternatives: if one trajectory is a correct description of the system, all others must be incorrect. By contrast, the choice between consistent families is never a choice between mutually exclusive alternatives in this same sense, and while different quantum frameworks can be incompatible, incompatibility is a very different relationship from that of being mutually exclusive, as will be shown in Sec. IV. Nevertheless, it is probably useful to include classical mechanics among our list of analogies, if for no other reason than that the disanalogous features are sometimes employed to analyze consistent history results, leading to the (erroneous) conclusion that the latter are unsatisfactory. Classical statistical mechanics, itself a stochastic theory, provides a better analogy for the quantum choice problem than does classical mechanics. Thus our fifth analogy is a coarse graining of the classical phase space (CHQR, Sec. VII A), a covering of  by a set of non-intersecting cells, which provides a coarse-grained description of the system through specifying which cell is occupied by the phase point at a succession of times. (Making these a finite set of discrete times, and allowing the cells defining the coarse graining to depend upon time, produces the closest analogy with the quantum case.) Choosing a coarse graining and choosing a quantum framework are analogous in that in both cases the choice is one made by the physicist in terms of the physical problems he wishes to discuss, and is not something dictated by the laws of nature. At least in the case of the classical coarse graining, it is at once obvious that this choice has no influence on the behavior the system being described, although it may very well limit the type of 9

description which can be constructed. For example, in order to describe irreversible or other hydrodynamic behavior, one wants cells which are not too large, but also not too small. Because the coarse graining is chosen by the physicist, the corresponding description can be said to be "subjective", but this is a harmless subjectivity, because two physicists who use the same coarse graining will reach identical conclusions. There is another analogy in that once a coarse graining has been specified, one and only one coarse-grained history will actually occur, since a phase space trajectory will be in precisely one cell of the coarse graining at any given time. In probabilistic terms, a succession of cells from the classical coarse graining at a sequence of different times is an element of a sample space, just as an elementary history in a quantum framework is an element of a sample space, and given a sample space, one expects that one and only one of the constituent "events" will actually occur. Along with the positive analogies just discussed, there is an important disanalogy between descriptions based on classical coarse grainings and those which employ quantum frameworks. Two classical coarse grainings always possess a common refinement, a third coarse graining constructed from the intersections of the cells in the two collections. Thus given any two coarse-grained histories which describe the same system (over the same time interval), there is always a finer-grained history constructed using the common refinement, and which incorporates, or implies, each of the coarser histories. The ultimate refinement of all coarse grainings is, of course, a description of the system in terms of a phase space trajectory. Two compatible quantum frameworks possess (as a matter of definition) a common refinement, and for them the situation is quite analogous to the classical state of affairs just discussed. However, incompatible frameworks often arise in quantum theory, as illustrated in Sec. II, and their mutual relationship is necessarily different from that which exists among (always compatible) classical coarse grainings. The solution to the problem of (quantum) choice suggested by the classical analogies discussed above (with the exception of classical mechanics, where a good analog of a quantum choice does not exist) is that the choice can be made on pragmatic grounds, that is to say, relative to the physical problems which concern the physicist who is constructing a quantum description. There is, to be sure, no guarantee that this solution is the correct one, for analogies have their limitations, and we have just noted an important one in the case of classical statistical mechanics (which also applies to the other examples in this section): there is nothing which corresponds to quantum incompatibility. On the other hand, there is also no reason to suppose that, just because they are imperfect, the analogies have led us to a false solution of the choice problem. To obtain further insight, we need to take a closer look at quantum incompatibility in quantum terms. That is the subject of the next section.
IV. QUANTUM INCOMPATIBILITY A. Logic in two dimensions

In Sec. II we introduced three separate consistent families of histories, or frameworks, to describe the same physical system. The analogy of the draftsman in Sec. III suggests that these can be thought of as three distinct, but equally valid, perspectives from which 10

to describe the system. However, none of the analogies of Sec. III provides insight into the fact that F1 , F2 , and F3 are incompatible alternatives. Quantum incompatibility of this sort has no good classical analog, so one needs to employ quantum examples in order to understand it. The simplest non-trivial quantum system, a two-dimensional Hilbert space, which we shall think of as representing the angular momentum states of a spin half particle, can provide some useful insight into what is going on. The discussion given here employs a somewhat different point of view from that in CHQR Sec. VI A, and can be thought of as supplementing the latter. The histories of interest involve only one time, and the "event" at this time corresponds to a ray, or one-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space, whose physical interpretation is that the component of spin angular momentum in a particular direction in space is 1/2 (in units of h). For example, a particular ray which we denote by Z + (the same symbol denotes ¯ the ray and the projector onto the ray) corresponds to the proposition "Sz = 1/2". What corresponds to the negation of this proposition, to "it is not the case that Sz = 1/2"? While one might suppose it to be "the spin is in some other direction", standard quantum mechanics identifies negation of a proposition with the orthogonal complement of the corresponding subspace, which means that the negation of "Sz = 1/2" is the unique ray Z - perpendicular to Z + , which corresponds to the proposition "Sz = -1/2". Understanding negation in this way has a certain plausibility: after all, if Sz is not equal to 1/2, what other value can it have? Furthermore, applying negation twice in a row brings us back to the original property. Nonetheless, the translation of logical terms, such as "not", into a quantum context is a nontrivial matter, and the reader who is not content with the traditional approach is welcome to try and improve upon it. If we agree that the negation of a ray R in a two-dimensional Hilbert space is the ~ orthogonal ray R, the next question to address is the definition of "R and S" (R  S) for two rays. Guided by the rules of ordinary propositional logic, it is plausible that if S = R, then R  R = R, and if S is the negation of R, ~ ~ R  R = R  R = 0, (4.1) where 0 is proposition which is always false, corresponding to a projector onto the origin of ~ the Hilbert space. But what if S is neither R nor R? We might suppose that in such cases there is always a third ray T (which depends, of course, on R and S) such that R  S = T. However, (4.2) is unsatisfactory, for consider the result ~ ~ ~ R  T = R  (R  S) = (R  R)  S = 0  S = 0 (4.3) (4.2)

obtained by applying the usual logical rules governing "". For this to hold, T must be ~ the same as R, since in all other cases we are assuming that R  T is another ray, not 0. ~ However, the argument in (4.3) applied to T  S tells us that this, too, is 0, so that T must be the same as S. But T cannot be equal to both R and S, since, by hypothesis, they are unequal. One way out of this dilemma is to follow Birkhoff and von Neumann [24] , and assume that whenever R and S are unequal, "R and S" is false: 11

R = SR  S = 0.

(4.4)

Taking the negation of both sides of the equality in (4.4), and using the usual rules of logic, we conclude that, under the same conditions, "R or S" (R  S) is true: R = SR  S = I, (4.5)

where I represents the proposition which is always true, corresponding to the identity operator on the Hilbert space. Alas, (4.4) and (4.5) lead to a contradiction if we employ the standard distributive law of propositional logic: Q  (R  S) = (Q  R)  (Q  S). (4.6)

The reason is that if Q, R, and S are three distinct rays, the left side of (4.6), using (4.4) and assuming that Q  0 = Q, is Q, while the right side, see (4.5), is I  I = I. Birkhoff and von Neumann's solution to this problem is to adopt a "quantum logic" in which (4.6) no longer holds. Consistent histories has a very different way of escaping the dilemma posed by (4.3). ~ When S is different from either R or R, the properties corresponding to these two rays are said to be incompatible, and R  S is considered to be meaningless: it is not a formula composed according to the syntactical rules which govern meaningful quantum discourse. To illustrate the difference between this and the approach of Birkhoff and von Neumann, suppose that Sz = 1/2 is true. According to (4.4), "Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2" is false, as is "Sx = -1/2 and Sz = 1/2". The normal rules of logic would then tell us that both Sx = 1/2 and Sx = -1/2 are false, which cannot be the case, since one is the negation of the other. Consequently, the usual rules of logical reasoning have to be modified if one uses the Birkhoff and von Neumann system. By contrast, in the consistent history approach, "Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2" is neither true nor false; instead, it is meaningless. Thus the truth of Sz = 1/2 tells us nothing at all about Sx , so we do not reach a contradiction. Similarly, in the consistent history approach it makes no sense to ask "is Sx = 1/2 or is Sz = 1/2?", for such a question implicitly assumes that the two can be compared: one is true and the other false, or perhaps both are true, or both are false. But none of these is possible under the rules of consistent history reasoning [25]. Unless propositions belong to the same framework, which in the particular example we are considering (but not in general; see below and App. A) is equivalent to requiring that the corresponding projectors commute with each other, the consistent history formalism allows no logical comparison between them, of any kind. In particular, it is very important to distinguish incompatible, which is the relationship between Sx = 1/2 and Sz = 1/2, from mutually exclusive, the relationship between Sz = 1/2 and Sz = -1/2. As already noted, the truth of Sz = 1/2 tells us nothing at all about the truth or falsity of the incompatible Sx = 1/2. However, the truth of Sz = 1/2 at once implies that Sz = -1/2 is false, since the two are mutually exclusive: if a spin half particle emerges in one channel from a Stern-Gerlach apparatus, it surely does not emerge in the other channel. Standard textbook quantum mechanics escapes the dilemma of (4.3) by yet a different method, by ignoring it and treating a quantum system as a "black box" which can be subjected to external (classical?) measurements. But ignoring a problem does not necessarily 12

make it go away, and the enormous conceptual confusion which besets "the measurement problem" in standard quantum theory is an almost inevitable consequence of its inability to provide clear principles for discussing the properties of a spin half particle.
B. Generalization to histories

In CHQR, two frameworks or consistent families F and F  were defined to be incompatible if they lack a common refinement, that is, if there is no consistent family G which contains all the histories in both F and F  . Consistent with that usage, we shall say that two histories Y and Y  are incompatible if there is no (single) consistent family which contains both of them, and a framework F and a history Y  are incompatible if there is no consistent family G which contains Y  along with all the histories in F . The spin half case discussed above is best thought of as a "quantum analogy" which illustrates some, but not all of the features of incompatibility. In particular, it shows how incompatibility can arise when the projectors representing properties at a single time do not commute with each other. This is also the source of incompatibility for the histories and families discussed in Sec. II C, where the projectors on the Hilbert space of histories (as in (2.6) and (2.11)) do not commute with each other. Incompatibility can also arise because, even though the relevant projectors commute, consistency conditions are not satisfied for the enlarged Boolean algebra. For an example, see Sec. VI D in CHQR (and App. A below). Whatever the source of incompatibility, consistent histories quantum theory deals with it in the manner suggested above in the discussion of a spin half particle, through a syntactical rule which states that all logical argumentation must take place inside a single framework or consistent history (for details, see CHQR). On the other hand, the usual rules of reasoning apply within a single framework, and for these purposes no modifications of standard propositional logic are required. And, just as in the case of a spin half particle, it is important to distinguish quantum incompatibility, which means no comparison is possible between two histories (or results calculated in two frameworks), from mutually exclusive, the relationship between two elementary families belonging to the same framework. Thus if A and B are mutually exclusive, the truth of one implies the falsity of the other or, as histories, the occurrence of A means that B did not occur, and vice versa. If, on the other hand, A and B are incompatible, the truth of one, which can only be defined relative to some framework which contains it, tells us nothing about the truth or falsity of the other; they are "not comparable": no comparisons between them are possible, because such comparisons make no (quantum mechanical) sense. In particular, if A and B are incompatible histories, the question "did A occur or did B occur?" does not make sense, for there is no framework in which they could be compared. We have already applied these principles in discussing the examples in Sec. II, in particular when noting that no discussion of the MQS state S at time t2 can be meaningfully combined with the histories (2.11) used in F2 to discuss which detector detected the photon. Similarly, the family F1 of unitary time evolution cannot be used to discuss, much less answer, the question "which detector?", because F1 is incompatible with histories containing C  or D  at t2 . And since, as noted above, incompatibility prevents us from asking whether the history 0  s CD  S occurred rather than 0  s CD  C  D or 0  s CD  CD , it 13

does not make sense to ask which of the incompatible frameworks F1 and F2 provides the correct description of this gedanken experiment. Generalizing from this example, we conclude that whenever F and G are any two incompatible families, one cannot ask which provides the correct quantum mechanical description; because the two sample spaces are mutually incompatible, they cannot be compared. But even if F and G are compatible, it also makes no sense to ask which is correct, for in that case their relationship is analogous to that of two classical coarse grainings, as discussed in Sec. III, and it is obvious that one cannot say that one coarse graining provides a "correct" and another an "incorrect" physical description. Since alternative frameworks are either compatible or incompatible, we conclude that it is never sensible to ask "which is the correct framework?", at least in the same sense in which one can ask "which is the correct classical phase space trajectory?". The relationship between phase space trajectories is that between mutually exclusive possibilities, whereas quantum frameworks are not related to each other in this way. Of course it does make sense to ask "which framework is useful for solving this particular problem?", or "which framework provides one with the greatest physical insight?", just as in the case of classical coarse grainings.
C. Using measurements to confirm histories

Further insight into how the descriptions provided by two or more incompatible families are related to each other can be obtained by asking how the predictions of consistent history quantum theory about the behavior of a closed quantum system might, in principle, be verified experimentally. Imagine that the system is in a closed box, the initial state 0 is known, and the consistent historian (who, needless to say, is outside the box [26]) has carried out calculations of probabilities for different histories belonging to a variety of distinct and mutually incompatible families. How might these probabilities be checked by measurements? Checking them involves opening the box, or at least letting the contents interact in some way with the external world, and this immediately raises the well-known problem that measurements might disturb what is going on in the box, so that the results they reveal might not be indicative of what would have happened in their absence. However, the very same objection can be raised in a "classical" context in which specifically quantum effects play no role. A box might contain sensitive photographic film which would be changed if one were to look at it. Or perhaps the box contains a bird which will escape if the box is opened. In the end there is no ultimate proof that one's measurement is not creating the effect observed, just as there can be no ultimate argument against solipsism. However, if he had a theory which was sufficiently powerful to predict the perturbing effects of a measurement, and if other predictions of this theory for other situations had been amply confirmed by experiment, a physicist (in contrast to a philosopher) would probably be willing to use it in order to design measurements which produced minimal perturbations, or to calculate the effects of perturbations if these were unavoidable. Consistent history quantum mechanics is a theory of this sort, unlike standard textbook quantum mechanics, whose inability to relate the results of measurements to properties of the system being measured is one of its principal deficiencies. Of course, using this approach cannot demonstrate that the consistent history 14

predictions of what is going on in a closed box are "really true", but it does provide the sort of internally consistency which in other areas of science (e.g., the study of the earth's core by means of seismic waves) is considered good evidence for the existence of phenomena which cannot be directly observed. As an example, consider Fig. 2(a), which is a stripped down version of the gedanken experiment in Fig. 1, as the detectors C and D have been omitted from the quantum system enclosed in the box indicated by the heavy line. We consider two consistent families E1 and E2 with histories of non-zero weight: E1 : E2 : a  c, a  d as (4.7) (4.8)

referring to events at the times t0 and t1 ; the notation is that of Sec. II. To check the predictions of E1 , we open holes in the sides of the box, Fig. 2(b), at a time just before the photon would have encountered one of the walls, to allow it to pass out of the box and be detected by one of the two detectors C and D. Since the two histories in (4.7) are predicted to occur with probability 1/2, checking this requires repeating the experiment a number of times. To determine whether opening the holes and placing detectors outside the box has somehow perturbed the system, we employ a consistent history analysis of the larger closed system which includes the original box and the detectors C and D (along with the mechanism for opening the holes, etc.). For this larger system we ask: if the photon is detected by C, was it earlier (while the holes were still closed) in the c channel? The answer is affirmative; see (2.17) and the associated discussion. As in each realization of the experiment the particle is detected by C or D, this confirms the usual consistent history interpretation of the two histories in (4.7) as mutually exclusive alternatives, one or the other of which must occur in any particular case. If we employ family E2 , the single history in (4.8) is predicted to occur every time the experiment is carried out. To verify this requires the slightly more complicated arrangement shown in Fig 2(c). Once again, the holes are opened at the last possible instant, but then a pair of mirrors and a second beam splitter are used to compare the phases of the wave packets emerging in the c and d channels. Assume the path lengths are arranged so that a photon initially in a eventually emerges in f . The fact that the photon is always detected by F , and never by E, can then be used as an experimental confirmation that it was in the state s at t1 , since a consistent history analysis of the larger closed system yields the result Pr(s1 | 0  F2 ) = 1. (4.9)

Once again, it is the ability of consistent histories to verify that a measured system had a particular property before the measurement took place which lends plausibility to the experimental confirmation of a prediction referring to processes going on in a closed system. Checking events at intermediate, rather than final times in a family of histories can be carried out using analogous, though somewhat more complicated arrangements. One can imagine the box to be supplied with ports through which probes of appropriate type can be inserted at appropriate times. The argument that this sort of measurement is possible in principle (that is, without violating the laws of quantum theory), and that appropriate measurements do not perturb the system in unacceptable ways, will be found in Sec. 5 of [1]. 15

Alternatively, one can suppose that a single closed box contains both the system of interest and appropriate measuring apparatus which interacts with the system at suitable times and records the results. At the end of the experiment the box is opened and the records are read. In either case, the consistent history approach allows one to discuss whether the system actually did have the properties which the measurements revealed, and whether these measurements perturbed the system in unacceptable ways. Whether the events of interest occur at intermediate or final times, checking the predictions given by different incompatible frameworks always involves alternative experimental arrangements which are either mutually exclusive, as in Fig. 2(b) and (c), or of a sort in which one set of measurements makes it impossible to discuss the system using some alternative consistent family. In any case, just as there is no single "correct" choice of consistent family for describing the system, there is no single arrangement of apparatus which can be used to verify the predictions obtained using different families. Note that neither the framework nor the experimental arrangement needed to check its predictions is singled out by some "law of nature". Indeed, were there some such law which told us, for example, that E1 is the correct framework, we would have great difficulty interpreting the results of measurements of the sort shown in Fig. 2(c). In this sense, the physicist's freedom to choose a framework, as suggested by the classical analogies in Sec. III, is not only possible in the presence of quantum incompatibility, but appears necessary in order to have a theory with a consistent physical interpretation.
V. SUMMARY AND SOME APPLICATIONS A. Overall summary

The example in Sec. II together with the classical analogies in Sec. III and the discussion of incompatibility in Sec. IV lead to the following conclusions relative to the problems of choice and incompatibility as stated at the end of Sec. II. There are many posable consistent families or frameworks which can be used to describe the same quantum system, and the choice of which of these to employ is a choice made by the physicist based upon pragmatic considerations, namely the type of physical problem he is trying to study or the question he wants to answer. Because of quantum incompatibility, a question such as "where was the photon before it was detected?" can be answered in certain frameworks and not in others. Given a particular physical question there are still, in general, a large number of frameworks in which it can be discussed, but since they all yield the same values for the relevant conditional probabilities, choosing among them is, relative to this particular question, rather like the choice of gauge in classical electromagnetism: the answer does not depend upon the framework. The choice among alternative compatible families is closely analogous to the choice among coarse grainings of a classical phase space, a situation in which it is transparently obvious that the physicist's choice of a mode of description has no influence whatsoever on the physical system being described. Furthermore, such a choice is not "subjective" in any unacceptable way, for two physicists who use the same coarse graining will reach identical conclusions. That these same conclusions are still correct in the case of a choice between 16

incompatible consistent families is not so obvious, because there is no good classical analogy. Nonetheless, their truth is supported by the discussion of quantum incompatibility in Sec. IV. To begin with, the relationship of incompatibility between frameworks (or between histories, etc.) is quite distinct from that between mutually exclusive alternatives (as in a sample space), where the correctness of one means that the others are necessarily false. Incompatible frameworks are never related in this way; and from the fact that some history has occurred, one cannot conclude that some other history incompatible with it has not occurred. Understanding the difference between mutually exclusive and incompatible helps prevent one from supposing that the physicist's choice of a framework somehow influences the world by "preventing" or "interfering with" histories which occur in some other framework. Instead, the choice simply limits the type of description which the physicist can construct. Additional support is provided by the discussion, in Part C of Sec. IV, of how predictions of what goes on in a closed system based upon the consistent histories formalism, can in principle be checked experimentally. This "operational" point of view confirms that the choice of consistent family is up to the physicist, but that the experimental arrangements needed to confirm the predictions made using a particular framework depend upon that framework. By contrast, assuming that the framework is determined by some "law of nature", rather than chosen by the physicist, is rather unhelpful, since it produces new conceptual difficulties. Incompatibility, as noted in Sec. IV A, is a specifically quantum concept which represents one way of meeting the (necessary!) process of modifying the logic of classical propositions in order to achieve descriptions which conform to the way standard quantum theory employs Hilbert space. In the consistent history approach, incompatibility is a syntactical rule which governs which combinations of propositions about a quantum system can be said to be physically meaningful. In this respect it is quite different from the approach of Birkhoff and von Neumann [24], and has the advantage that within a single consistent family there is no need to replace the ordinary logic of propositions with a new "quantum logic". (By contrast, textbook quantum mechanics in effect evades the logical issues by constructing a phenomenological theory of measurement, thus giving rise to an insoluble "measurement problem" completely absent from the consistent histories approach.) To be sure, quantum incompatibility and the choice among incompatible frameworks for describing a particular quantum system are not matters which can be easily understood using an intuition trained largely by the "classical" world of everyday experience. This should come as no surprise: quantum mechanics is distinctly different from classical mechanics, and it is only to be expected that it contains concepts which conflict with pre-quantum thinking. The same is true of special relativity in relationship to Newtonian mechanics. The fact that events which occur at the same time in one coordinate system need not be simultaneous in another, and the physicist's ability to change the time difference between them by adopting a new coordinate system, have not been considered insuperable barriers, or even serious objections to adopting special relativity as a good scientific theory of the world, and supposing that it provides a better description of physical reality than pre-relativistic physics. Although the analogy is, of course, not perfect, there seems to be no reason why the physicist's liberty to choose a consistent family renders consistent histories an unsatisfactory interpretation of quantum theory, nor why quantum incompatibility should not be included 17

with our other ideas about what constitutes physical reality.
B. Logic, truth, and reality

The structure of quantum reasoning set forth in CHQR, which is largely compatible with earlier work by Omn`s [4,6], agrees with but also differs from ordinary propositional logic, e depending upon one's point of view. As long as the discussion is confined to a single framework (or "logic", in Omn`s' terminology) the usual rules employed for ordinary probabilistic e theories apply, and no new logical concepts are required. In this respect one can agree with Omn`s that consistent histories quantum theory does not require a new "unconventional e logic" [27]. On the other hand, the syntactical rules which determine what propositions can be part of a framework, whether two frameworks are compatible, and the like, are decidedly non-classical, since their very definitions are based upon properties of the quantum Hilbert space and the corresponding unitary time transformations. As these rules are essential for correct quantum reasoning, and are thus central to the logical structure of quantum theory, it is also correct to say that, as least in this respect, consistent histories does involve a new form of logic, one with no classical counterpart. Thus d'Espagnat's assertion [28] that consistent histories reasoning ". . . could only be valid in some as yet unspecified logic, of which it is not even known how it could be self-consistent" is not off the mark, though it is now out of date, since in CHQR the required self-consistent logic has been specified in considerable detail, filling in various items lacking in the earlier [5]. As noted in Sec. IV A, the use of some form of non-classical reasoning is virtually inescapable once one accepts the association of propositions, and their negations, with subspaces of Hilbert space, in the way generally employed in standard quantum theory. Whereas consistent histories handles this in a very different way from the quantum logic of Birkhoff and von Neumann, it still employs non-classical (and hence counterintuitive) ideas. One important difference between Omn`s and CHQR is in the definition of "true". In e CHQR, "true" is interpreted as "probability one". Thus if certain data are assumed to be true, and the probability, conditioned upon these data, of a certain proposition is one, then this proposition is true. The advantage of this approach is that as long as one sticks to a single framework, "true" functions in essentially the same way as in ordinary logic and probability theory. However, because probabilities can only be discussed within some framework, comparisons of "true" between incompatible frameworks are impossible, and in this sense "true" interpreted as "probability one" must be understood as relative to a framework. The feature just mentioned has been criticized by d'Espagnat [12,13,15]. But it is hard to see how to get around it if one wishes to maintain (as do Omn`s and I) that reasoning e inside a single framework should follow classical rules, and classical rules associate "true" (in a probabilistic theory) with "probability one". Omn`s' attempt to develop an alternative e definition of "true" [4,6] did not succeed [17] , as he himself admits [29], and at present there seems to be no serious alternative to CHQR. In defense of the latter it is worth noting that, as a very general principle, one cannot expect to import classical concepts into quantum theory "duty free", that is, without alterations, either in formal definitions, or in intuitive 18

properties, or both. This is widely accepted by physicists in the case of dynamical quantities: we do not insist that quantum position and momentum commute with each other. That it also holds for logical properties and relationships deserves to be more widely appreciated; see the discussion of "not" and "and" in Sec. IV A (and of "contrary" in App. A). Thus it is unreasonable to expect that "quantum truth" will coincide with "classical truth" in every respect. The definition adopted in CHQR has some virtues; these include the fact that it is (almost) the same as its classical counterpart in the case of a single framework, and reduces to the usual sense of "true" in the classical (correspondence) limit in which incompatibility disappears and all frameworks possess a common refinement. Given these properties, it seems reasonable to adopt the definition given in CHQR as a suitable quantum counterpart of "true", at least until some superior alternative appears on the scene. Similarly, d'Espagnat [30] thinks that consistent history quantum theory cannot be interpreted in a realistic way, because it does not conform to "a basic requirement of traditional realism, that there are facts that are true quite independently of the conventions we decide to make as to which consistent family of histories we prefer to discuss." In response, it is worth noting that some modifications of traditional realism are only to be expected if quantum theory is one of the truly revolutionary developments of twentieth century science. Nevertheless, the changes in pre-quantum realism required if we adopt consistent histories are perhaps less radical than d'Espagnat's words might suggest. Note, first of all, that the choice of framework by a physicist is not something by which he can, in any sense, render true propositions untrue, or make untrue propositions true. The reason is that as long as frameworks are compatible, choosing one or another is as "harmless" as selecting one of the alternative coarse grainings of classical phase space, as discussed in Sec. III. If, on the other hand, some framework is chosen which is incompatible with a proposition, this choice does not make the proposition true or false; instead the proposition is "indiscussible" within this framework. As this point is often misunderstood, it may be helpful consider the specific example discussed in Part C of Sec. IV. Suppose that theorist T, standing outside the box of Fig. 2, has used family E2 , (4.8), to make a prediction, and experimentalist E has set up the apparatus to test it using the arrangement in Fig. 2(c). Suppose a second theorist, T*, carries out calculations using the incompatible family E1 instead. Will this alter what is going on inside the box? Obviously not; E's confirmation of T's prediction will be entirely unaffected by T*'s calculation! On the other hand, T* will, if he limits himself to E1 , be unable to provide a coherent account of how E's measurement confirms T's prediction. In order to do that, T* needs to employ E2 . If he does so, he will, of course, obtain the same result as T. On the other hand, if T* can persuade E to carry out an alternative experiment using the arrangement of Fig. 2(b)--this cannot, of course, be done at the same time as the experiment in Fig. 2(c), but might be done later using a second photon--then this, or at least a sufficient number of experiments of this type, will confirm T*'s result, a situation which T can understand if he, too, employs E1 . As well as showing that the choice of framework does not imply some mysterious influence of mind upon matter, this example illustrates some other aspects of quantum reality as viewed using consistent histories. The existence of a choice of framework does not render quantum theory subjective, for if T and T* adopt the same framework, they come to the same conclusion. Predictions of what is going on in a quantum system can, in principle, 19

be checked experimentally; the theorist's freedom to choose a framework merely means that alternative experimental arrangements are needed to check predictions made using different frameworks. Objective descriptions (in the sense just discussed), experimental confirmation, and the absence of peculiar influences of mind over matter are aspects of traditional realism which continue to hold true in the quantum realm if we accept the results of consistent histories. But there is also something very different: one cannot simultaneously employ E2 and E1 for describing what is going on in the closed box. Not because using one of them makes the other false, but because there is no way of combining the results from the two incompatible families. Thus a "unicity" always present in classical physics, the ability to combine any two descriptions of the same system in a single description, is absent in quantum theory. If one wishes to maintain that this unicity is truly indispensable to realism, then, obviously, consistent history quantum theory cannot be said to be "realistic". The alternative, which of course I favor, is to include quantum incompatibility as part of our understanding of what quantum reality is all about, and why it differs from what reality was thought to be like before the advent of quantum theory.
C. Is consistent histories a predictive theory?

As the result of a detailed study [16,17], Dowker and Kent conclude that the consistent history approach to quantum theory lacks predictive power, and for this reason is not satisfactory as a fundamental scientific theory. They accept the idea that once a consistent family ("consistent set" in their terminology) is specified, one and only one of the corresponding elementary histories will take place, and quantum theory can only assign a probability to the different possibilities. That the theory is probabilistic in this sense is not what concerns them. Rather, it is the fact that the consistent history approach, as a fundamental theory, treats all frameworks or consistent families "democratically", and provides no criterion to select out one in particular. In other words, there is no "law of nature" which specifies the framework. Thus, from their perspective, there is no way of calculating probabilities of specific histories, since probabilities cannot be computed without using some framework, and the theory does not tell one which framework to use. Both CHQR and the present paper agree with Dowker and Kent that consistent histories, as a fundamental theory of nature, does not single out a particular framework. The difference is that Dowker and Kent regard this situation as unsatisfactory, whereas from the perspective presented here there does not seem to be any problem if one regards the physicist's choice of framework to be like the draftsman's choice of a perspective for representing a threedimensional object, or like the choice of a coarse graining of classical phase space. That is, the choice is dictated by the problems which the physicist seeks to address, the questions he is attempting to answer, and not by some law of nature. Given some question of physical interest, quantum incompatibility severely limits the choice, as noted in the case of the specific example in Sec. II, and discussed further in Sec. IV. There seems to be no reason why an element of choice of this type should render a theory unsatisfactory. It may not agree with certain aesthetic criteria for what constitutes "good science", but such criteria tend to be somewhat subjective, as in the case of Einstein's preference for a deterministic 20

rather than a probabilistic quantum theory. Insofar as Dowker and Kent regard the choice of framework as being a choice among mutually exclusive alternatives, which seems to be their perspective in Sec. 5.6 of [17], their point of view is quite different from that presented above in Sec. IV: that if two frameworks are compatible, the relationship between them is analogous to that between classical coarse grainings, and if they are incompatible, in the quantum sense of that term, it is still not correct to suppose that the use of one framework excludes the other in the same way that employing one trajectory in a classical phase space excludes all other trajectories. Thus one should never think of one framework as "correct" and another as "incorrect", other than in a sense like "this is the correct framework to address the problem which I have in mind". A particular instance of the lack of predictive power, according to Dowker and Kent, is that consistent history quantum theory cannot answer the question, "Will the world be quasiclassical tomorrow?" See CHQR, Sec. VII B, for a discussion of quasiclassicality in relationship to the ideas considered here. The term "quasiclassical" is somewhat vague, but the essence of Dowker and Kent's concern lies in the fact that the consistent histories formalism does not rule out the possibility of MQS states. In particular there are families in which only "normal" (non-MQS) states occur up to some particular time, and MQS states appear at later times, so that "quasiclassical" behavior up to some time is no guarantee that it will continue. The example in Sec. II can serve to illustrate this point. Family F1 contains the "nonquasiclassical" MQS state S at t2 , whereas F2 has "normal" detector states C  D and CD ; at the earlier times t0 and t1 these families are identical, and the coherent superposition state s of the photon at time t1 , because it is easily achieved and detected in the laboratory, can be considered compatible with a "quasiclassical" description. The consistent history approach gives no reason to choose F2 rather than F1 to represent the state of affairs at t2 . On the other hand, as pointed out in Sec. IV, a question of the form "will the system be in S, or will it be in one of the two states C  D or CD at t2 ?" is not meaningful, because it requires, at least implicitly, a comparison between mutually incompatible alternatives, and quantum incompatibility implies that no such comparison is possible, that is, it does not make sense. It is like asking, "does the spin half particle have an x or a z component of angular momentum?" Note that "quasiclassical", interpreted as "non-MQS", is not a quantum mechanical property as such, since it is not associated with a subspace of the quantum Hilbert space. Thus while both |C  D and |CD in the example of Sec. II refer to non-MQS states, the smallest subspace which contains them also contains the MQS state |S . This suggests that "quasiclassical" is best thought of as a term belonging to the metalanguage of quantum descriptions, the language used to discuss these descriptions, rather than as a term which can itself enter into a quantum description. To use a classical analogy, the term "large cells" could be employed to characterize a coarse graining of a classical phase space, and it belongs to the metalanguage, for it obviously is not correct to think of "large cells" as a property of the physical system itself. The question "will the world be quasiclassical tomorrow?" is thus comparable to "will tomorrow's coarse graining use large cells?". Both might make sense as part of a discussion among physicists as to how to construct a description of a physical system which best addresses the problems which interest them; neither refers directly to properties of the system being described. 21

To summarize, while it makes sense to compute probabilities of different histories given a quasiclassical framework, it does not make sense to assign a probability to such a framework, or treat it as one of a collection of mutually exclusive physical alternatives. Quasiclassicality is a property of quantum descriptions, not a property of quantum systems, and the question "is this quantum system quasiclassical?" is not meaningful, at least when understood in the same sense as "is the energy between 9 and 10 ergs?". For the same reason, quasiclassicality cannot be a condition in a quantum probability, which is why a recent argument by Kent, examined in App. B, is inconsistent with the rules of quantum reasoning given in CHQR. Despite the obvious differences between the present paper and the approach of Dowker and Kent, there is a sense in which the conclusions complement each other. By studying the structure of consistent histories under the assumption that alternative consistent families are somewhat analogous to the mutually exclusive possibilities represented by a sample space, Dowker and Kent concluded that this approach does not result in a satisfactory scientific theory. That is perfectly compatible with the perspective of the present paper. A rather different approach to consistent histories was considered by Dowker and Kent in Sec. 5.4 of [17] under the title "many histories". See the following section for some comments.
D. List of histories

Given any consistent family of histories for a particular system, one and only one of the elementary histories will actually occur. This statement makes it tempting to suppose that it is possible to construct a list {Fj , Fj } which assigns to every consistent family Fj a history Fj , understood as the history which actually occurred in a particular system or a particular realization of an experiment. This temptation should be resisted; no such list exists, at least if it is interpreted in the manner just suggested. Note that if the Fj are alternative coarse grainings of a classical phase space, the existence of such a list is not in doubt, for one simply takes whatever classical trajectory actually occurs, and employs it to generate the history Fj by noting which cell of Fj is occupied by the trajectory at each time. In the same way, if the quantum list contains only consistent families which are mutually compatible with one another, the list can be constructed by using the common refinement. When, however, incompatible families occur in the list--as will necessarily be the case if all consistent families are included--the quantum list does not make sense. Consider the example in Sec. II. For F1 there is only one history, (2.6), with positive weight, which must therefore be F1 . For F2 there are two histories with positive weights, (2.11), so F2 must be one of these. But whichever it is, it makes no sense to say that a single system (and a single experimental run) can be correctly described by both F1 and F2 , since at t2 the detectors cannot be said to be in the MQS state S and also in one of the states C  D or CD . To be sure, one might adopt an alternative interpretation of the list {Fj , Fj }, and understand it as referring to what happens in distinct but nominally identical systems, or in successive repetitions of an experiment, labeled by the subscript j. In such a case there is no problem, for it is not necessary to use the same framework every time an experiment is carried out, or for describing different systems. But this is obviously a very different 22

interpretation of the list from that employed above. Dowker and Kent's "many histories" interpretation, Sec. 5.4 of [17], involves such a list, although their interpretation of what it means is not very clear. If it is thought of as applying to a single system, or a single universe, then at least from the perspective adopted in this paper, it does not make much (quantum mechanical) sense. It is only fair to add that Dowker and Kent themselves show very little enthusiasm for their "many histories" interpretation .

APP. A. CONSISTENT HISTORIES AND CONTRARY INFERENCES

In recent work [19,20], Kent has stated that the consistent history approach cannot be taken seriously as a fundamental theory because it allows for what he calls "contrary inferences". We shall show that the problem is not with consistent histories quantum theory as presented in CHQR and the present paper, but rather with Kent's definition of "contrary", which fails to take proper account of quantum incompatibility when it arises from violations of consistency conditions. For a condensed version of these remarks, see [31]. The Aharonov-Vaidman [32] example discussed in CHQR Sec. VI D can be used to illustrate the central point of Kent's argument. A particle can be in one of three states |A , |B , or |C , and the dynamics is trivial: |A  |A , etc. Define   | = (|A + |B + |C )/ 3, | = (|A + |B - |C )/ 3, (5.1) and (consistent with previous notation) let a letter outside a ket denote the corresponding projector, and a tilde its complement, thus: A = |A A|, ~ A = I - A = B + C, (5.2)

etc. Define a consistent family A of histories starting with  at time t0 , followed by A or ~ A at a later time t1 , and  at a still later time t2 . It is straightforward to show, using this framework, that Pr(A1 | 0  2 ) = 1, (5.3)

where the subscripts indicate the time associated with the corresponding event. That is, we can be sure that the particle was in state A at t1 , given the initial state  at t0 and the final state  at t2 . An alternative framework B, incompatible with A, uses the same events at t0 ~ and t2 , and B and B at t1 . Using B, one finds Pr(B1 | 0  2 ) = 1. 23 (5.4)

Kent defines two projectors A and B to be "contrary" provided AB = BA = 0, ~ A = B, (5.5)

~ and employs the term "contradictory" when A = B. Since A and B in the AharonovVaidman example satisfy (5.5), Kent would conclude that (5.3) and (5.4) are two probabilityone inferences based on the same data, 0  2 , to two contrary events, and he finds this feature of the consistent history approach to be problematical. To analyze this argument, we first note that the term contrary has a well-defined usage in classical logic [33], where it indicates the relationship between two propositions which cannot both be true, but might both be false. "The queen is in London" and "the queen is in Cambridge" are contrary propositions in this sense: they are mutually exclusive, so they cannot both be true, but they could both be false (if the queen is in some other city). Similarly, contradictory is reserved for the relationship of two propositions which cannot both be true, and also cannot both be false. For example, "the queen is in London" is false if and only if "the queen is not in London" is true, and vice versa. Translating terms from classical logic into appropriate quantum counterparts is not a trivial exercise; see CHQR and Sec. IV of the present paper. As long as A and B belong to the same consistent family, (5.5) is a reasonable quantum counterpart for the classical term "contrary", and agrees with the rules worked out in CHQR. The problem with Kent's argument is that he wishes to apply the same definition in a case in which A and B do not belong to the same consistent family. In the Aharonov-Vaidman example, B is incompatible, in the quantum mechanical sense (Sec. IV) with the family A used to obtain (5.3), while A is incompatible with the family B used to obtain (5.4). When quantum incompatibility obtains, the consistent history approach, for reasons indicated in Sec. IV, disallows any logical comparison whatsoever. Thus as long as one is considering inferences based upon the data 0  2 , A and B are best thought of as "incomparable", and speaking of them as "contrary" in a sense similar to that used in classical logic is misleading. To put the matter in another way, in order to be able to say that A and B are contrary in the sense of classical logic, consistent history rules require that they belong to the same framework. However, any framework which contains both A and B at t1 cannot also contain both  at t0 and  at t2 . Consequently, in a framework in which it would be correct to say that A and B are contrary, neither of the inferences (5.3) and (5.4) is possible. So, whichever way one looks at the matter, there are no "contrary inferences". The key point is that consistent history reasoning, as clearly stated by Omn`s [34] and reiterated in CHQR, e must employ a single framework, and Kent's argument violates this rule through defining [35] "contrary" in a manner which allows it to hold as a relationship between propositions which are not members of a single framework. The same point can be made in a slightly different way. In Sec. II we exhibited two probability one inferences, in (2.17) and (2.18), based upon identical conditions but carried out in two incompatible families, F3 and F2 . The nonsensical result (2.19) of combining these two inferences was blocked by the consistent history rule that results deduced in incompatible families cannot be combined. It is precisely this same rule which applies in the case of (5.3) and (5.4). The only difference is that while a quantum comparison of c and s from (2.17) and (2.18) is obviously nonsensical, because the projectors do not commute, that of A and B 24

as inferred in (5.3) and (5.4) is not as transparently incorrect, since the projectors commute, even though one has an equally serious violation of precisely the same consistent history rule. Note that quantum incompatibility can arise in the consistent histories approach both because certain projectors do not commute and because consistency rules are violated. The incompatibility of A with B, and of B with A, is of the latter type, which is why it is a bit less evident than the incompatibility of c and s in the example of Sec. II. In summary, to say that A and B are "contrary" in a logical sense when they belong to incompatible frameworks is a violation of one of the basic principles of consistent history reasoning, at least as the subject has been developed up to now. To be sure, there may exist alternative approaches to consistent histories based upon a different sent of logical rules, and one might view Kent's argument as, in effect, proposing such an alternative. In that case there would be no reason to disagree with his conclusion, which would be that this alternative proposal constitutes a formalism which cannot be taken seriously as a fundamental theory of nature, for precisely the reasons which he points out. Finally, a comment on the question which Kent raises in the latter part of [19]: why should the formalism of consistent histories rule out inferences to two "contradictory" propositions while allowing inferences to two "contrary" propositions? The brief response is that, according to the formalism for consistent histories developed in CHQR, neither "contrary" nor "contradictory" can be defined as logical relationships unless both of the properties (or histories) being compared are found in the same consistent family. Thus this formalism never allows an inference to either "contradictory" or "contrary" pairs of propositions, and so the question raised by Kent does not arise. Of course, alternative formulations of consistent histories which construct logical definitions in a way which allows contrary inferences to occur are subject to the conceptual problem which Kent has pointed out, and have to deal with it in some way. For one such alternative, see [20]
APP. B. CONDITIONING UPON QUASICLASSICALITY

Kent has claimed that even if one assumes that the world will be quasiclassical tomorrow, the consistent history approach does not always yield probabilistic predictions which agree with those provided by Copenhagen (i.e., standard textbook) quantum theory. The following example illustrates his argument, and shows why it cannot be considered a serious objection to consistent histories as described in CHQR and the present paper. Suppose the beamsplitter in the example in Sec. II (Fig 1) is replaced by one which produces beams in three exit channels c, d, and e, corresponding to a unitary time development  |a  (|c + |d + |e )/ 3 (5.6) in place of (2.1). A third detector E is added for the e channel, so that |e |E  |E  D1 : D2 : 0  {C  DE, CD E, CDE  }, 0  {SE, CDE  }, 25 (5.7)

in addition to (2.2). We now consider two consistent families involving two times, t0 and t2 : (5.8) (5.9)

where the initial state (the counterpart of (2.4)) is |S is the MQS combination of |C  D and |D  C defined in (2.5), and the curly brackets in (5.8) and (5.9) enclose alternative possibilities at t2 . As usual, various histories of zero weight have been omitted. A straightforward analysis using D1 yields Pr(C  DE | 0 ) = Pr(CD E | 0 ) = Pr(CDE  | 0 ) = 1/3, (5.11) that is, the probability is 1/3 that each of the detectors will have detected the photon, whereas from D2 one concludes that The fact that Pr(CDE  | 0 ) is the same in both cases reflects a general property of the consistent histories approach, as noted in Sec. II. Kent would accept (5.11) and (5.12) as correct, but would then argue that if one conditions upon quasiclassicality, the probability that E detects the photon is different in families D1 and D2 ; to be specific: D1 : Pr(CDE  | 0  quasiclassical) = 1/3, D2 : Pr(CDE  | 0  quasiclassical) = 1. (5.13) (5.14) Pr(SE | 0 ) = 2/3, Pr(CDE  | 0 ) = 1/3. (5.12) |0 = |aCDE , (5.10)

The argument is that all three histories in D1 are quasiclassical (no MQS states), and thus each has a probability 1/3, whether or not one conditions upon quasiclassicality. On the other hand, in D2 the only quasiclassical history is 0  CDE  , since the other involves the far-from-classical superposition S, and thus conditioning upon quasiclassicality yields (5.14) in place of (5.12). The problem with this argument, if one adopts the point of view of CHQR, is that conditional probabilities are only defined when their arguments are projectors belonging to an appropriate Boolean algebra satisfying consistency conditions. But, as noted in Sec. V C, there is no subspace of the Hilbert space, and hence no projector, corresponding to "quasiclassical", understood in the present context as "non-MQS". Thus the conditional probabilities (5.13) and (5.14) are undefined, and no argument based upon them can be valid. Is there some way to define "quasiclassical" as a condition entering into a probability without referring to a subspace of the Hilbert space? If, as suggested in Sec. V C, the term "quasiclassical" belongs to the metalanguage rather than the language of quantum descriptions, such a definition would change the meaning of the resulting probabilities in an important way. Thus imagine that D1 and D2 were two coarse grainings of a classical phase space using cells of different sizes. Then by conditioning upon the initial condition and the fact that the history only involves, say, large cells, one could produce a difference analogous to that between (5.13) and (5.14). But the result would obviously have no direct physical significance, although it might be useful in addressing the question of which coarse graining is most useful for a numerical simulation. Of course, there may be some alternative to CHQR in which "quasiclassical" refers directly to a quantum property. In that case, Kent's argument would indicate that this alternative (in contrast to CHQR) is not likely to reproduce standard quantum physics. 26

complete description of itself. Consequently, it is always simplest to imagine that a quantum description is being constructed outside the system which it purports to describe. Sometimes the question is asked as to how we can describe, in a scientific sense, the universe in which we live. This is a non-trivial philosophical issue, but it does not seem implausible to assume that some sort of analogy will work: we can imagine simple model systems inside a closed box, check that they have some features which we find in our everyday experience, and then extrapolate by imagining ourselves in a large box, etc. See [6], p. 499.

But if A and B are not in the same consistent family, "perp" says nothing about a logical relationship.

The problem of an experimental verification of complete positivity of quantum mechanical evolutions has recently attracted some attention in the context of the neutral kaon decay problem [1]. However, in the mainstream C  -algebra and semigroup literature the requirement of complete positivity was usually treated as on obvious one and the physical motivation was the following [2­8]. We begin with a system, labelled "1", whose dynamics is given by some positive map t (a) = a(t), 1 t : A  A 1 (1)

It is clear that if 1+2 (t) is to be a density matrix it should be positive. Moreover one should be able to do the construction for any m. If this is the case the map t is said to be completely positive. The dynamics one typically 1 thinks of in quantum mechanics is linear and therefore the notion of complete positivity was initially defined only for linear maps [9]. However there are many situations in physics where the dynamics is nonlinear. This nonlinearity may be an effective result of eliminating some degrees of freedom (Hartree-type theories [10]) or be of fundamental origin, like in various versions of nonlinear quantum mechanics. Although the latter theories do not yet correspond to any concrete physical situation they have led to some formal developments especially due to the famous "EinsteinPodolsky-Rosen malignancy" discussed by Gisin and others [11­15]. The argument for complete positivity we have presented does not seem to crucially depend on the linearity of t . It 1 is therefore natural to extend the above definition of complete positivity also to maps which are not linear. Properties of such nonlinear completely positive maps were first investigated by Ando and Choi [16] and Arveson [17]. A surprise came when Majewski and Alicki showed in [18,19] that a simple Hartree-type nonlinear evolution of a finite-dimensional density matrix does not lead to a dynamics completely positive in the sense of [16,17]. The dynamics they considered was given by the nonlinear equation i = [h(), ]  1 (4)

where akl  A. It follows, the argument continues, that since the dynamics on A is given by t each of the entries 1 evolves as t (akl ) = akl (t) and the whole density matrix is mapped into 1  t  1 (a11 ) t (a12 ) . . . t (a1m ) 1 1  t (a21 ) t (a22 ) . . . t (a2m )  1 1  1  1+2 (t) =  (3)  =: t . . . . 1+2 1+2 (0) . . . . .   . . . . t (am1 ) t (am2 ) . . . t (amm ) 1 1 1

where A is a C  -algebra. We require positivity of t since if a is a density matrix we want the same to be true for 1 a(t). Now consider a density matrix 1+2 (0) of some bigger system "1+2". If for simplicity we assume that both systems are finite dimensional it is clear that the initial density matrix of "1+2" is of the form   a11 a12 . . . a1m  a21 a22 . . . a2m    1+2 (0) =  . (2) . . . , . . .   . . . . . am1 am2 . . . amm

where h() = Tr (Q)Q is a time independent nonlinear Hamiltonian operator. The solution of (4) is t (0) = e-ih()t (0)eih()t . (5)

To show that (5) is not completely positive in the sense of Ando, Choi and Arveson one expands the RHS and shows that the terms of mixed homogeneity (m, n), m, n  N , are not completely positive. There exists also a simpler argument. Let us modify (4) by making its RHS 1-homogeneous in . This can be obtained, for example, by taking h() = Tr (Q)Q . Tr  (6)

The solution is again (5) but with h() given by (6). The dynamics is now 1-homogeneous: t () = t (). But there is a theorem [16] stating that a completely positive and 1-homogeneous dynamics is linear, so (5) is not ¯ completely positive. Had this result been physically correct we would not have to look at the K-K decay to find a non-completely-positive and physically meaningful quantum evolution. Alicki and Majewski suggestion was to investigate more precisely the problem of uniqueness of solutions leading to non-completely-positive nonlinear evolutions. In particular they pointed out that the generator given by the RHS of (4) is not an accretive one and the Cauchy problem can have different solutions [20]. They did not however dare to challenge the basic definition given in [16,17] although some doubts about the physical importance of complete positivity were raised already in [21]. We will now show that the Hartree-type evolution cannot rule out complete positivity because it is the basic Ando-Choi-Arveson definition that is physically incorrect. To do so we shall consider an example of the Hartreetype evolution, essentially equivalent to the one discussed in [18,19]. The new element we introduce is a physically correct way of describing composite systems which involve nonlinear evolutions. This subtle point was clarified in the papers by Polchinski [13] and Jordan [22], and generalized in [23,24]. It will be shown that the definition of complete positivity given in [16,17] leads to the same type of problems as the definition of dynamics of composite systems given by Weinberg in [25]. This unphysical definition not only led to the nowadays famous "faster-than-light telegraph" but also predicted an apparently paradoxical disagreement between the Bloch equation and Janes-Cummings approaches to two-level systems [26]. A correct description given in [26] showed that the paradox is a result of a wrong formalism. It proved also that a precise way of describing noninteracting systems leads to a meaningful dynamics when the systems are coupled. Consider two noninteracting systems described by Hamiltonian functions H1 (1 ) = Tr 1 h1 )2 / Tr 1 1 and H2 (2 ) = Tr 2 2 . Here 1 and 2 are, respectively, n × n and m × m density matrices. According to general rules [13,22,23] the Hamiltonian function of the composite system is H1+2 (1+2 ) = H1  Tr 2 (1+2 ) + H2  Tr 1 (1+2 ) = Tr 1+2 h  12 1+2 ) + Tr 1+2 1+2 . Tr 1+2 1+2

The evolution is given by a Lie-Poisson equation [22,23,27] i involving, in this case, the Poisson bracket {A, B} = kl A B lk - (A  B) kk ll (10) d jj  = {jj  , H} dt (9)

which, when translated to the standard matrix notation, leads to the nonlinear Liouville-von Neumann equations i 1 = 2  i 2 = 0  i1+2  Tr 1+2 h  12 1+2 =2 [h  12 , 1+2 ]. Tr 1+2 1+2 Tr 1 h1 [h, 1 ] Tr 1 1 (11) (12) (13)

(To obtain (13) one treats each index in (10) as a composite one: k = k1 k2 , etc.) A general theorem implies that all the expressions involving traces are time independent (as depending on Hamiltonian functions and Tr ). Therefore we can immediately write the solutions 2

(14) (15) (16)

It is clear that the self-consistency condition Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 1+2 1 (17)

typical of a well defined dynamics is fulfilled. It should be stressed that (17) is not accidental but follows from the very construction of the nonlinear Lie-Poisson dynamics. The dynamics given by t is nonlinear but 1-homogeneous. The Theorem 4 in [16] states that the dynamics can not 1 be completely positive. It is obvious, however, that our dynamics preserves positivity of (t) both for the subsystem and the composite system (cf. the discussion of positivity given in [28]). The dynamics can be uniquely extended from subsystems to the composite ones and then again reduced to subsystems giving the correct result, and this is of course valid for any m. So the dynamics looks completely positive! To understand what goes wrong consider a more detailed example. Let us take the positive matrix from the proof of Theorem 4 in [16] as a t = 0 density matrix: a+b a+b a  a+b a+b+c a+c 1+2 (0) =  a a+c a+c a a a   a a a a

(18)

where a, etc. are positive and Hermitian n × n matrices (so here we take m = 4). A reduced density matrix corresponding to the nonlinear subsystem is 1 (0) = Tr 2 1+2 (0) = 4a + 2b + 2c. The solution for the subsystem is 1 (t) = exp - 2i Tr 1 h(2a + b + c) Tr 1 h(2a + b + c) ht (4a + 2b + 2c) exp 2i ht Tr 1 (2a + b + c) Tr 1 (2a + b + c) (20) (19)

The solution for the whole system is a+b a+b a Tr 1 h(2a + b + c)  a+b a+b+c a+c 1+2 (t) = exp - 2i ht  12  a a+c a+c Tr 1 (2a + b + c) a a a   a Tr 1 h(2a + b + c) a exp 2i ht  12 . (21) a Tr 1 (2a + b + c) a

This dynamics is consistent with (20) because all the exponents are identical. However, it is not in the form one assumes in [16­19]! Indeed what one typically assumes would correspond to t (a + b) t (a + b) t (a) 1 1 1 t t t  1 (a + b) 1 (a + b + c) 1 (a + c) 1+2 (t) =  t (a) t (a + c) t (a + c) 1 1 1 t (a) t (a) t (a) 1 1 1   t (a) 1 t (a)  1 . t (a)  1 t 1 (a)

(22)

It is sufficient to compare the "11" entries of (22) and (21) to see that they are different. The correct dynamics (21) gives a + b  exp - 2i Tr 1 h(2a + b + c) Tr 1 h(2a + b + c) ht (a + b) exp 2i ht Tr 1 (2a + b + c) Tr 1 (2a + b + c) (23)

whereas (22), which one naively expects, would give 3

a + b  exp - 2i

Tr 1 h(a + b) Tr 1 h(a + b) ht (a + b) exp 2i ht Tr 1 (a + b) Tr 1 (a + b)

(24)

To understand the physical origin of the effect let us note the following. First the indices of the 4×4 matrix correspond to a choice of basis of a Hilbert space in the subsystem "2". This choice is arbitrary and may be thought of as being defined by some observable measured in "2". Therefore no physically meaningful quantity in "1" can depend on it. (22) implies that after time t the reduced density matrix is wrong (t) = t (a + b) + t (a + b + c) + t (a + c) + t (a). 1 1 1 1 1 Assume that an observer in "2" changes the basis  1 0  0 0 The reduced dynamics of "1" becomes in "2" by the unitary transformation  0 0 0 1 0 0  1  1 0 2 - 2  . 1 1 0 2 2 (25)

(26)

c c wrong (t) = t (a + b) + t (a + b + c) + t ( ) + t (2a + ). ~1 1 1 1 1 2 2

(27)

Obviously the reduced dynamics of "1" is now different and this is essentially the celebrated "faster-than-light tele1 1 graph" of Gisin [11,29]. To explicitly see this take h = 3 , a = 16 1 + 1 , b = 0, c = 8 1 + 3 . Then 2 4 4 1 wrong (t) - wrong (t) = - sin2 t cos t1 + sin t2 ~1 1 4 3 3 3 (28)

The correct dynamics is free of this problem because the nonlinear terms occuring in the reduced density matrix are basis independent. The lesson we are taught by this concrete example is the following. First, to speak about the composition problem in nonlinear theories, one has to specify the way the subsystems "1" and "2" evolve. This concerns not only the subsystem "1" we are interested in, but also the "rest" (this, in principle, may be also a nonlinear evolution). Then one has to specify the dynamics of the composite "1+2" system. This is the most delicate point and one cannot just take any linear definition and use it for a nonlinear system. Finally one must make sure the definitions are basis independent and the selfconsistency conditions Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 1+2 1 Tr 1  t = t  Tr 1 1+2 2 (29) (30)

are met. If any of the latter conditions is not fulfilled, the dynamics is unphysical. The definition of complete positivity accepted in [16,17] does not satisfy these requirements and therefore the fundamental problem of a general characterization of nonlinear completely positive maps is still open.

Simple Hartree-type equations lead to dynamics of a subsystem that is not completely positive in the sense accepted in mathematical literature. In the linear case this would imply that negative probabilities have to appear for some system that contains the subsystem in question. In the nonlinear case this does not happen because the mathematical definition is physically unfitting as shown on a concrete example. PACS numbers: 02.30.Sa, 03.65.Bz, Db, 05.30.-d, 11.10.Lm

It follows, the argument continues, that since the dynamics on A is given by t each of the entries evolves by 1 akl  t (akl ) and the whole density matrix is mapped 1 into   t 1 (a11 ) . . . t (a1m ) 1   . . . . . .

Linear maps that are positive but not completely positive (CP) [1­8] have been shown to play an essential role in characterization of degree of entanglement of correlated quantum systems [9­11], an important issue for quantum computation and cryptography. A possibility of an experimental verification of CP of quantum evolutions was discussed in the context of the neutral kaon decay problem in [12]. Although the notion of CP may seem somewhat abstract and technical, it has a simple physical interpretation for linear maps. We begin with a system, labelled "1", whose dynamics is given by some positive map t (a) = a(t), t : A  A where A is a set 1 1 of bounded operators acting in a Hilbert space H1 . To avoid technicalities we assume H1 is finite dimensional. In linear quantum mechanics a reversible dynamics is given by t (a) = Ut aUt-1 where Ut is unitary. 1 We require positivity of t since if a is a density ma1 trix we want the same to be true for a(t). Now consider a density matrix 1+2 (0) of some bigger system "1+2" consisting of the original one plus a system whose dimension is m and which evolves trivially (its Ut = 1). The initial density matrix of "1+2" is of the form 1+2 (0) =
ss kl m

In the context of CP maps it is more standard to use the isomorphic form [13]

If 1+2 (t) = 1+2 (0) is to be a density matrix it should not lead to negative probabilities. Moreover one should be able to do the construction for any m. If this is the case the map t is said to be CP. The dynam1 ics one typically thinks of in quantum mechanics is linear and therefore the notion of CP was initially defined only for linear maps [14]. However there are many situations in quantum physics where the dynamics is nonlinear. A nonlinear evolution of observables in Heisenberg picture is typical of quantum optics and field theory. Nonlinearly evolving states appear in mean field theories (Hartree-type equations [15]), soliton theory (nonlinear Schr¨dinger equations), and various attempts of nonlino ear generalizations of quantum mechanics. Although the latter theories do not yet correspond to any concrete physical situation they have led to some formal developments especially due to the famous "Einstein-PodolskyRosen malignancy" discussed by Gisin and others [16­19] (see Appendix C). The argument for CP we have presented does not seem to crucially depend on the linearity of t . It is there1 fore natural to extend the above definition of CP also to maps which are not linear. This was done independently by Ando and Choi [21] and Arveson [22] and a general structure theorem characterizing all CP (linear and nonlinear) maps was found. Apparently the problem was solved. A surprise came when Majewski and Alicki showed in [23,24] that a simple Hartree-type nonlinear evolution of a finite-dimensional density matrix does not lead to a dynamics completely positive in the sense of [21,22]. This 1

can be shown as follows. Consider a nonlinear equation i = [h(), ] where h() = Tr (Q)Q/Tr  is a time in dependent nonlinear Hamiltonian operator. The solution of the equation is t (0) = e-ih()t (0)eih()t . (5)

[18,26,27,29] the Hamiltonian function of the composite system is H1+2 (1+2 ) = H1  Tr 2 (1+2 ) + H2  Tr 1 (1+2 ) Tr 1+2 h  12 1+2 )2 = + Tr 1+2 1+2 . Tr 1+2 1+2 (6) (7)

To show that (5) is not completely positive in the sense of Ando, Choi and Arveson it is sufficient to note that t () = t () whereas there is a theorem [21] stating that a completely positive and 1-homogeneous dynamics is linear. The result seems to imply that any mean-field nonlinear evolution of a density matrix leads to negative probabilities! Alicki and Majewski suggestion was to investigate more precisely the problem of uniqueness of solutions leading to non-completely-positive nonlinear evolutions. In particular they pointed out that the generator given by the above nonlinear equation is not accretive and the Cauchy problem can have different solutions [25]. They did not however dare to challenge the basic definition proposed in [21,22]. We will now show that the Hartree-type evolution does not imply negative probabilities because it is the basic Ando-Choi-Arveson definition that is physically unfitting. To do so we shall consider an example of the Hartree-type evolution, essentially equivalent to the one discussed in [23,24]. The new element we introduce is a physically correct way of describing composite systems which involve nonlinear evolutions. This subtle point was clarified in the papers by Polchinski [18] and Jordan [26], and generalized in [27­29]. We will first show that the form of correctly extended dynamics differs from the one assumed in the discussion of complete positivity although reduces to the standard expression if the dynamics is linear. Next it will be shown that the definition of a completely positive map analyzed in [21,22] involves implicitly an ill defined extension of nonlinear dynamics to tensor product spaces. The physical problem turns out to be of the same type as the one with the definition of dynamics of composite systems given by Weinberg in [30] . The Weinberg definition not only led to the nowadays famous "faster-than-light telegraph" but also predicted an apparently paradoxical disagreement between the Bloch equation and Janes-Cummings approaches to two-level systems [31]. A corrected description [31] showed that the paradox is a result of a wrong formalism. It proved also that a precise way of describing noninteracting systems leads to a meaningful dynamics when the systems are coupled.

The main motivation for the definition (6) is the fact that the Lie-Poisson dynamics of density matrices generated by (6) allows for a complete separation of the two subsystems: A reduced dynamics of a subsystem is characterized entirely in terms of quantities intrinsic to this subsystem and this holds for all initial conditions for 1+2 and all Hamiltonian functions Hk (the most general discussion of this problem can be found in [29] where an extension to situations where no Hamiltonian function exists is also analyzed). The evolution is given by a LiePoisson equation [26,27,32] idkk /dt = {kk , H} involving, in this case, the Poisson bracket {A, B} = kl B A lk - (A  B) kk ll (8)

which, when translated into the standard matrix notation, leads to the nonlinear Liouville-von Neumann equations 2 = 0 and  i 1 = 2  i1+2  Tr 1 h1 [h, 1 ] Tr 1 1 Tr 1+2 h  12 1+2 =2 [h  12 , 1+2 ]. Tr 1+2 1+2 (9) (10)

Equation (10) is a very natural extension of the 1-particle dynamics (9) and could be taken for granted even without the general background we have given above. Define Ut 1 (0) = exp - 2i Tr 1 h1 (0) ht/ Tr 1 1 (0) (11)

All the expressions involving traces are time independent (as depending on Hamiltonian functions and Tr  which is a Casimir invariant). Therefore we can immediately write the solutions 2 (t) = 2 (0) and 1 (t) = Ut 1 (0) 1 (0)Ut-1 1 (0) 1+2 (t) = Ut 1 (0)  12 1+2 (0)Ut 1 (0)  12 . It is clear that the self-consistency condition Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 1+2 1 (14) (12) (13)

II. EXAMPLE

Consider two noninteracting systems described by Hamiltonian functions H1 (1 ) = Tr 1 h1 )2 / Tr 1 1 and H2 (2 ) = Tr 2 2 . Here 1 and 2 are, respectively, n × n and m × m density matrices. According to general rules 2

typical of a well defined dynamics is fulfilled. It should be stressed that (14) is not accidental but follows from the very construction of the Lie-Poisson dynamics [29]. The dynamics given by t is nonlinear but 11 homogeneous. The Theorem 4 in [21] states that the dynamics can not be completely positive. It is obvious, however, that our dynamics preserves positivity of (t) both for the subsystem and the composite system (this is a general property of this formalism, see [33]). The

where a, b are positive and Hermitian n × n matrices (so here we take m = 4). A reduced density matrix corresponding to the nonlinear subsystem is 1 (0) = Tr 2 1+2 (0) = 4a + 2b. The solution for the subsystem is 1 (t) = Ut (2a + b)(4a + 2b)Ut-1 (2a + b) The solution for the whole system is 1+2 (t) a a a  a a+b a+b ~ = Ut (2a + b)  a a+b a+b a a a   a a  ~ -1 U (2a + b), a t a

dynamics can be uniquely extended from subsystems to the composite ones and then again reduced to subsystems giving the correct result, and this is of course valid for any m. So the dynamics looks completely positive! To understand what goes wrong consider a more detailed example. Let us take the positive matrix as a t = 0 density matrix (cf. the proof of Theorem 4 in [21]):   a a a a  a a+b a+b a  (15) 1+2 (0) =  a a+b a+b a  a a a a

(16)

is related to (3) by a similarity transformation akl = ~ -1 k l Ukk ak l Ul l where Ukk is a C-valued unitary m × m matrix. In the generic case the choice of bases is arbitrary and no physically meaningful quantity in the subsystem "1" can depend on the choices made in "2". Mathematically this means that all physical quantities in "1" should be invariant under unitary similarity transformations of (3) or, which is equivalent, changes from (2) to (22). If the latter condition is not satisfied the density matrix t 1+2 1+2 (0) is mathematically ill defined for t > 0. A knowledge of 1+2 (0) is insufficient for predicting 1+2 (t): One has to additionally fix a basis. It is obvious that this problem does not occur for the "correctly" extended dynamics. (18) implies that after time t the reduced density matrix is 1 (t) = t (a) + t (a + b) + t (a + b) + t (a). 1 1 1 1 (24)

~ where Ut (2a + b) = Ut (2a + b)  12 . This dynamics is consistent with (16) but is not in the form one assumes in [21­24]! Indeed what one typically assumes would correspond to   t t (a) t (a) 1 (a) t (a) 1 1 1 t t t t  1 (a) 1 (a + b) 1 (a + b) 1 (a)  . (18) 1+2 (t) =  t 1 (a) t (a + b) t (a + b) t (a)  1 1 1 t (a) t (a) t (a) t (a) 1 1 1 1 It is sufficient to compare the "11" entries of (18) and (17) to see that they are different. The correct dynamics (17) gives a  Ut (2a + b)aUt-1 (2a + b) whereas (18), which one naively expects, would give a  Ut (a)aUt-1 (a) (20) (19)

Assume that at t = 0 we change the basis in "2" by the unitary transformation   1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0   1  1 (25)  0 0 2 - 2  . 1 1 0 0 2 2

Let us stress again the important fact that this unitary transformation represents a passive modification of coordinates of 1+2 (0) resulting from the change of basis. This should not be confused with the active transformation 1+2 (0)  1  U 1+2 (0)1  U -1 . Such a transformation would in general change 1+2 (0) into a new density matrix  (0) and it might not be very surpris1+2 ing that two different density matrices evolve differently. The transformations we discuss leave 1+2 (0) unchanged and still change the dynamics. Indeed, the reduced dynamics of "1" becomes b b 1 (t) = t (a) + t (a + b) + t ( ) + t (2a + ). ~ 1 1 1 1 2 2 (26)

Actually, it can be shown that a physically correct dynamics cannot be in the form (18) for two essential reasons. Indeed, let us first note that the bases chosen in (2) ~ are arbitrary. Choosing a new basis |k in "2" instead of |k one obtains 1+2 (0) =
~l ss k~ m

~ l| 1+2 (0)ss k~|s s |  |k ~ ~ ~l ~ l|. ak~  |k ~ ~ ~l

(21)

=
~ l=1 k,~

(22)

Obviously the reduced dynamics of "1" is now different and this is essentially the celebrated "faster-than-light telegraph" of Gisin [16,35]. In the original Gisin telegraph described in [16] one performs the change of basis in "2" by changing the direction of a Stern-Gerlach device. Assuming that each measurement of spin in "2" reduces the two-particle entangled state to a concrete eigenstate in "1" one nonlocally decomposes the beam of particles into two sub-beams which are assumed to evolve

3

independently. Mathematically this amounts to assuming that the reduced density matrix in "1" is a convex combination of projectors corresponding to the chosen basis. The effect is based on the fact that for a nonlinear map t and two different ways of writing the density ma1 trix of "1" as convex combinations 1 (0) = k pk k = t ~ t  ~ ~ k pk 1 (~k ). The rek pk 1 (k ) = k pk k one has duced density matrices of "1" we obtain by the reductions (24) and (26) have these properties. To explicitly 1 see that they are different take h = z , a = 16 1 + x , 1 b = 8 1 + z , where k are the Pauli matrices. Then 1 2 4 4 1 (t) - 1 (t) = - sin2 t cos tx + sin ty . (27) ~ 4 3 3 3 The correct dynamics is free of this problem because the nonlinear terms occuring in the reduced density matrix are basis independent. Paraphrasing Gisin's statement [34] one can say that a nonlinear evolution which is completely positive in the sense of [21,22] is physically relevant if and only if it is linear . A few years ago this might be a perfect argument against nonlinear quantum mechanics. The lesson we are taught by the example is the following. First, to speak about the composition problem in nonlinear theories, one has to specify the way the subsystems "1" and "2" evolve. This concerns not only the subsystem "1" we are interested in, but also the "rest" (this, in principle, can also be a nonlinear evolution). Then one has to specify the dynamics of the composite "1+2" system. This is the most delicate point and one cannot just take any linear definition and use it for a nonlinear system. One must make sure the definitions are basis independent if the choice of bases is physically irrelevant (i.e., if there is no superselection rule). For a nonlinear positive dynamics the conditions Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 , 1+2 1 t Tr 1  t 1+2 = 2  Tr 1 , play a physical role analogous to the requirement of CP for linear maps. The definition of CP accepted in [21,22] does not satisfy these requirements and therefore the fundamental problem of a general characterization of physically relevant nonlinear completely positive maps is still open.

III. APPENDIX: CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES

A. Mixed states

In linear quantum mechanics mixed states are defined in several equivalent ways. In nonlinear quantum mechanics the definitions are no longer equivalent. According to the first definition a mixed state is a probability measure on the set of pure states. This definition is nonunique when one switches to nonlinear observables. To see this consider a state vector | representing a spin1/2 particle. Its Hilbert space is C 2 and the basis vectors are denoted by |0 and |1 . A state of mixed polarization can be represented by a C 2 -valued random variable | = 0 |0 + ei 1 |1 , (28)

where   [0, 2) is a random phase. In linear quan^ tum mechanics the average of an observable A could be calculated as follows 1 2
2 0

^ ^ ^ d  |A| = |0 |2 0|A|0 + |1 |2 1|A|1 , (29)

which is equivalent to representing the state by the projector-valued random variable: With probability |0 |2 one finds |0 0|, and |1 1| with probability |1 |2 . When it comes to nonlinear quantum mechanics the two approaches are inequivalent. Consider a generalized average (i.e. observable)
 A(| , |) = (1 + 1 )5 .

(30)

A mixture of pure states can be represented by the "| valued" random variable   | and the average by 1 2
2 0

d A(| ,  |).

(31)

In our analysis we have used several techniques and made some statements that may appear controversial. The Appendix addresses three mutually related groups of such problems: Definition of mixed states, projection postulate and faster-than-light effects. 4

However, the mixture cannot be represented by a "| |-valued" random variable because A(| , |) cannot be written as a function of | |. [Proof : Assume there exists a function B(| |) = A(| , |) for any . But B(| |) = B(|ei  ei |) for any , and A(| , |) = A(|ei  , ei |) for almost all . Contradiction.] The assumption that all nonlinear observables on pure states can be written as functions (or functionals) of | | is therefore a serious restriction (see below). The approach to mixtures via probability measures on pure states was developed the works of Mielnik [36] who was also the first to seriously address the question of mixtures vs. nonlinearity (see also [37]). A definition of a mixed state which is widely used in the literature is the following: A mixed state is an operator  which is Hermitian, positive, trace-class and normalized (Tr  = 1), and which is not a projector (2 = ). This is the definition we use in the paper. In the nonlinear framework we use a density matrix  is a fully quantum object and has an onthological status analogous to this of a wave function in standard quantum mechanics. For

a modern discussion of density matrices from such a perspective see [39] From what we have written it does not yet follow how to introduce dynamics. Starting with pure states | one can take a nonlinear Schr¨dinger dynamics t  |(t) . o Starting with pure states | | one can take a nonlinear Liouville-von Neumann dynamics t  |(t) (t)|. These approaches are, in general, inequivalent because not all Hamiltonian functions H(| , |) can be written as H(| |). However, once we have an H = H(| |) we can treat it as a restriction to projectors of a more general H = H() and define a Lie-Poisson dynamics in terms of the B´na-Jordan Poisson bracket. This is what o we do in the paper. Suppose now we have a dynamics of  which preserves Hermiticity, trace-class property, and positivity of (t). The eigenvalues of (t) play then a role of probabilities analogous to those we discussed above. In spite of this expected property of (t) our density matrix cannot satisfy an ordinary convexity principle: A convex combination of two solutions is no longer a solution of the nonlinear evolution equation. Typically this is regarded as an argument against nonlinearly evolving . This problem was discussed by B´na and Jordan. They proposed the folo lowing interpretation. There are two kinds of density matrices in quantum mechanics. One class corresponds to a situation where an experimentalist controls the mixture by, for example, introducing the random phase. Then the pure-state componets of the mixture should be treated separately and the dynamics is nonlinear at the pure state level. This also assumes that there exists a privileged set of observables which is controlled during an experiment. As a result what one gets is a kind of a superselection principle. The second class of density matrices consists of those that arise because of some reduction procedure and entanglement. The typical example is a one-particle subsystem of an EPR pair. An observer at one side of this experiment has no way to control the mixture at the other side (see below). One can add that there exists a third class of mixtures that cannot be controlled either: These are simply very large systems. It is impossible to control the pure-state components of nonlinearly evolving mixtures that occur in Bose-Einstein condenstion of atomic clouds or chemical reactions described by nonlinear thermodynamics. Finally, let us give the fourth example. The nonlinear gauge transformations introduced by Doebner and Goldin [38] are based on the assumption that all actual measurements are based on those of the position observable. All theories that lead to the same probability densities in position space at any time and for all physical situations are therefore regarded as physically equivalent. Nonlinear gauge transformations do not change the position space probability density and although transform a linear Schr¨dinger dynamics into a nonlinear one, they o nevertheless do not generate any new physics [40]. An extension of Doebner-Goldin transformations to density matrices [41] leads to the requirement that the diagonal 5

elements of density matrices in position space, (x, x), must be unchanged by gauge transformations. Repeating the Doebner-Goldin argument one obtains a class of nonlinear theories that are fully equivalent to the linear Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. Such theories do not satisfy the ordinary convexity principle but only a "convexity principle on the diagonal" in position space.
B. Projection postulate

Consider a solution | of a linear Schr¨dinger equao tion. Projection of | on an eigenstate of a self-adjoint ^ operator A does not pose any problem since the projected state is again a solution of the same equation. When one tries to perform the same operation with a nonlinear Schr¨dinger equation one immediately faces two difficulo ties. First, the projected state is no longer a solution of the same equation and one has to add something not to leave the Hilbert space. This property was even used to test the logarithmic nonlinearity [42­44]. This "something" one has to add may be highly nontrivial (for example, a nonlinear gauge transformation [45]). Second, if the observable one measures is nonlinear the notion of an eigenstate is ambiguous [31,46]. To make an argument based on the projection postulate physically sound one has to explicitly address these issues. Otherwise the argument is hand-waving and cannot be conclusive. To avoid such dilemmas it is best to use any interpretation of quantum mechanics which is not based on the postulate. This is clearly acceptable and is not a pecularity of nonlinear quantum mechanics. Similar problems occur in quantum cosmology.
C. Faster-than-light signals

The problem with faster than light signals was independently discovered Gisin [16], Polchinski (see the footnote in [30]), Svetlichny [47] and one of us [48]. The first paper where a possibility of a conflict between locality and linearity was mentioned is the work of Haag and Bannier [20]. The original formulation due to Gisin made an explicit use of the projection postulate and was apparently model independent. An alternative "model-independent" version was given in [48]. The argument of Polchinski referred to the concrete version of nonlinear quantum mechanics proposed by Weinberg. The Weinberg model can serve as an illustration of all the three ways of generating the effect. It simultaneously shows what can be done to avoid it. Consider two separated systems described by Hamiltonian functions H1 (| |) = E1 | and H2 (| |) = E2 | +  |z | 2 . |

The element which is responsible for the faster-than-light effects is the particular form of Hamiltonian function of the composite system which is chosen as H1+2 (| , |) =
l

2 =

1 1 + Re(¯ ) sin 4(||2 - ||2 )t y  2 + Im(¯ ) sin 4(||2 - ||2 )t x .  (34)

H1 (|l l |) +

k

H2 (|k k |), (32)

The average of y in the nonlinear system is y = 2Re(¯ ) sin 4(||2 - ||2 )t  (35)

where |l = k kl |k , |k = l kl |l . Notice that H1+2 (| , |) = H1+2 (| |). There exist entangled solutions of the corresponding nonlinear 2-particle equation  = |1  |1 + |2  |2 (33)

where |j and |i are some solutions of the 1-particle Schr¨dinger equations corresponding to the subsystems. o The nonlinearity in "2" can make 1 |2 time dependent and proportional to sin(4 z t), where z is, in general, nonvanishing. Now consider the linear subsystem. Its reduced density matrix obtained from (33) contains 1 |2 which depends on . As a result there exists an observable in the linear system whose average value depends on . For example y = Im 1 |2 . The telegraph so obtained allows one to send information from the nonlinear system to the linear one. A physical interpretation of this phenomenon was given in detail in [19]. Technically the effect follows from the fact that an appropriate 2-particle Poisson bracket does not vanish: { y , H2 } = 0. The two functions appearing in this bracket correspond to different subsystems. An observation that in Weinberg's nonlinear quantum mechanics such brackets may not vanish is due to Polchinski. The proof given in [48] was based on the observation that entangled solutions of 2-particle nonliner Schr¨dinger equao tions may involve states whose scalar product 1 |2 is not conserved by the dynamics. As such it did not, apparently, refer to a concrete model. It turned out, however, that although the nonconservation of scalar products is a general property of nonlinear evolutions in Hilbert spaces [49] the existence of appropriate entangled solutions is not at all general. The telegraph described by Gisin in [16,17] works in the opposite direction and its mathematical origin is different. The element which is technically responsible for the Gisin effect is the basis dependence of the Hamiltonian function (32). To see this consider two bases in the linear system: A basis |± (spin "up" or "down"), and some other basis |, , ± = U (, )|± obtained from the "up-down" one by means of an SU (2) transforma  tion U (, ) = ¯ ¯ .The 2-particle solution which -  is the singlet at t = 0, written in the basis |, , r |s , r, s = ±, is
2 1 | =  e-i(E1 +E2 -X )t 2

and, hence, depends on the choice of basis made in the linear one. As we can see we have obtained the telegraphs without any use of the projection postulate. Interpreting H1+2 as an average energy, and taking into account that its value is basis dependent, we can conclude that this kind of description cannot correspond to a closed system. It is obvious how to eliminate both phenomena. First, one has to guarantee that the Hamiltonian function is basis independent (this eliminates the Gisin effect). The other effect is eliminated if any two functions corresponding to the two subsystems commute with respect to the 2-particle Poisson bracket. To make sure that the first condition is satisfied one can require that each subsystem observable is a function of the reduced density matrix of this subsystem. This leads naturally to a density matrix formalism but can be done also for pure states by restricting all 2-particle density matrices to projectors. It is quite remarkable that the restriction of all 1-particle observables to functions of local density matrices turns out to automatically guarantee the commutability of separated observables. Denote by Tr1 and Tr2 the partial traces. Consider two functions A = A(1+2 ) = A1  Tr2 (1+2 ) = A1 (1 ), B = B(1+2 ) = B2  Tr1 (1+2 ) = B2 (2 ), and let {·, ·} be a 2-particle bracket. Polchinski and Jordan noticed that then {A, B} = 0. Introducing the Casimir invariant C2 = Tr (2 ) one can show that the Poisson bracket {·, ·} is a particular case of a Nambu-type 1 3-bracket [50,27]: {·, ·} = {·, ·, 2 C2 }. The most general version of the Polchinski-Jordan theorem was proved in [27] in the following form: Theorem: Assume A and B are observables which are functionals of reduced density matrices of two separated N - and M -particle systems. Then {A, B, · } = 0, where the bracket corresponds to the composite (N +M )particle system. This result allows for an extension of the above construction to a more general class of "Lie-Nambu" theories where instead of C2 one puts a general nonlinear function F (the commutability of observables is independent of the choice of F ). In this context we would like to add two comments. First, the formalism of Polchinski, B´na and Jordan leads o ultimately to integro-differential equations, which contradicts the belief that local physics must involve "local" equations (for a discussion see [29]). Second, there exist global phenomena which do not necessarily lead to 6

-e-i2Xt ei2Xt ¯ -ei2Xt -e-i2Xt ¯

where X = ||2 - ||2 . The reduced density matrix of the nonlinear system "2" is

faster-than-light telegraphs but have no counterpart in liner quantum mechanics (e.g. the threshold effects discussed in [51] and the "Big Brother effect" occuring for a class of Lie-Nambu equations [52].)

Fluorescence into flat and structured radiation continua: An atomic density matrix without a master equation.

Max-Planck-Institut f¨r Quantenoptik u Hans-Kopfermann-Str. 1, 85748 Garching, Germany (February 9, 2008) We investigate an atomic -system with one transition coupled to a laser field and a flat continuum of vacuum modes and the other transition coupled to field modes near the edge of a photonic band gap. The system requires simultaneous treatment of Markovian and non-Markovian dissipation processes, but the photonic band gap-continuum can not be eliminated within a density matrix treatment. Instead we propose a formalism based on Monte-Carlo wavefunctions, and we present results relevant to the experimental characterization of a structured continuum. 42.50.-p, 42.50.Lc, 42.70.Qs

With the advent of photonic band gap (PBG) materials and dispersive media, the mode structure of the electromagnetic field can be tailored in a controllable fashion providing for instance band gaps or defect modes of various forms [1,2]. The rapidly varying mode structure in the radiation reservoir invalidates the Born-Markov approximations normally employed for a simple quantum system like an atom when this is located inside a PBGmaterial with transition frequency near the edge of the gap. The reservoir degrees of freedom are thus not easily eliminated to derive a master equation for the reduced system dynamics. The main body [3­6] of theoretical works on atomic interactions within PBG materials has therefore addressed the unitary dynamics in terms of the complete atom(s)+field wavefunctions. In this paper, we address a -system with one laserdriven transition experiencing a flat vacuum without structure and the frequency of the other transition near the edge of a PBG. A unitary wavefunction dynamics is incompatible with the treatment of the atomic fluorescence on the "free"-space transition, and we must seek a way to apply the simple Markovian properties of this process in the solution of the complete problem. A formulation in terms of Monte-Carlo wavefunctions (MCWF) turns out to be particularly useful for this purpose. This method then also suggests itself as a means of solving other problems emerging in the overlapping domain of quantum optics, semiconductors and nano-structures where dissipation of Markovian and non-Markovian character may co-exist. Furthermore, our work establishes an application of the MCWF treatment which goes beyond its conventional correspondence with Born-Markov master equations; at no point does such a master equation appear in this work. The -system is interesting from an experimental point of view since atoms may be present in their ground state in the dielectric host, and the dynamics of the interaction with the field modes in the vicinity of the gap may be studied when the laser excitation on the "free"-space transition is turned on. In partial analogy with the shelving scheme technique we note that the fluorescence signal 1

on the "free"-space transition may serve as to probe details of the interaction between the atom and the field modes in the PBG material. In a PBG one finds a modified dispersion relation for the photons in the radiation reservoir. The methods presented in the following apply for any mode structure and dispersion relation, but to illustrate the method we employ the isotropic model introduced by John and Wang [7,8]. Their dispersion relation for a periodic array of dielectric scatterers of radius a and index of refaction n, reads (with a separation of b = 2an between the scatterers): k = c 4n cos(2ka(1 + n)) + (1 - n)2 arccos 4na (1 + n)2

c which leads to a gap centered at the frequency 0 = 4na . With n = 1.082 the gap width  is 0.050 and the upper band edge frequency e is given by e = 0 + 1 2 0 = 1.0250 . In the vicinity of the band edge we have (effective mass approximation)

k = e + A(k - k0 )2 ,

(1)

where A = -2ac/ sin(4nae /c) and k0 = / (2a(n + 1)). We consider a three-level atom with two lower levels |a and |c coupled by the electric dipole coupling to a common excited level |b , see fig. 1. On the |a  |b transition we apply a laser field, and the atom may decay by spontaneous emission due to the coupling to a flat radiation reservoir. The transition |b  |c is accompanied by the emission of a photon with frequency in the vicinity of the photonic band gap edge, and this atomic transition is significantly modified by the presence of the dielectric host. Neglecting the zero-point energies of the field modes, and setting the atomic energy levels to the values 0, ¯ b h and hc respectively, we write the Hamiltonian for the ¯ system (¯ = 1) h

We assume that the coupling to the flat continuum may be treated by perturbation theory in the usual way, i.e. an energy shift (Lamb shift) and a decay rate  may be attributed to the excited state |b . The Lamb shift is assumed incorporated in the atomic energy b in eq. (2), and the decay rate describes an incoherent transition mechanism by which atoms in the excited state |b decay to the ground state |a . We shall incorporate the decay mechanism by an effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian Heff . First, we identify the wavefunction evolution governed by this Hamiltonian, and next, by appealing to the Monte Carlo wavefunction formalism we shall obtain the exact evolution of the atomic system. We apply the resolvent operator defined as [9] G(z) = 1 , z - Heff

where  is an infinitesimal small positive quantity. Due to the high order of the polynomial of z in the denominator and the presence of the square root terms in (5) and (6), it is not easy to apply the residue theorem and to obtain the amplitudes in time domain analytically. Instead we compute the two inversion integrals numerically. This integration is straightforward, and the calculation yields for example the populations of the initial ground state |a and of the excited atomic state |b as 0 0 function of time, a (t) = |Uaa (t)|2 , b (t) = |Uba (t)|2 . We keep track of the norm P (t) of the wavefunction, noting that it changes only due to the imaginary part of the ex0 cited state energy, and hence P |loss = -b (t), which t in integrated form reads

where z is a complex Laplace variable and Heff is the effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian of the system given by eqs. (2) and (3), but with the sums over a operators suppressed, and the replacement b  b - i/2. With the system initially in state a, the resolvent operator equations read (z - 0)Gaa (z) = 1 + Vab Gba (z + L ) (z -  )Gc a (z) = Vc b Gba (z) i (z - b + )Gba (z) = Vba Gaa (z - L ) + 2

In fig. 2 we show an example of the relevant time depen0 0 dent quantities P (t), a (t) and b (t). From the figure, it is evident that the populations in the states |a and |b approach zero after a transient evolution. There is, however, a substantial part of the population (P ()  20%) which is not lost by fluorescence on the free-space transition. This population is transferred to the atomic state |c associated with the PBG-continuum, and at any time 0 0 0 we have c (t) = P (t) - a (t) - b (t). The spontaneous decay on the |b  |a transition was treated only as a loss mechanism for the excited state amplitude, but the atoms are incoherently fed back in the ground state |a , and from here they are re-excited by the laser. In a density matrix formulation, when tracing over the resulting different photon number states of the flat reservoir, the elimination of the PBG-modes would be exceedingly difficult, if possible at all. It has been shown that dissipative problems in quantum mechanics may be solved by stochastic wavefunction equations as an alternative to master equations [10­14]. In the "quantum jump" scheme, one propagates state vectors according to a non-hermitian Hamiltonian, and at certain instants of time, chosen according to a random process, this propagation is interrupted by quantum jump projections of the state vectors (see [15] for a recent review). In the formulations of the method so far, the continuously propagated state vector is described as 2

(4) Vbc Gc a (z)


where Vab = gL and the amplitudes Gc a (z) pertain to the PBG-continuum states |c  |1 . Using eq. (1) in the summation over continuum modes and turning the summation into an integral, we get iCGba (z) (z - b + i/2)Gba (z) = Vba Gaa (z - L ) -  , z - e where the effective dipole coupling to the mode structure  2 is given by C = d2 k0 e /(40 A) [6], with d the atomic dipole moment on the b  c transition. Solving these coupled, algebraic equations for Gaa and Gba , we find

the solution of a Schr¨dinger equation, but, the atomic o 0 populations i (t) identified after elimination of the PBG reservoir above may be applied just as well for the construction of the atomic density matrix. The function P (t) is the norm of the no-jump state vector [13] and consequently the probability that a photon has not been registered in the flat reservoir at time t. The ensemble averaged populations can be found by solution of integral equations: The population of an atomic state  i (t) is a sum of a term representing the population given that the atom has not decayed and a term representing the population given that the latest jump occured at time t ,
t 0  i (t) = i (t) + 0 0 dt  b (t )i (t - t ).

(8)

0 0 Note that i (t) = i (t)/P (t) · P (t) provides the given normalized population with the appropiate no-jump weight-factor. Eq.(8) must be solved for  b (t) first, e.g. 0 0 by a Laplace transform:  b (z) = b (z)/(1 - b (z)), and one may subsequently obtain the other populations (see also [16]). The populations can of course also be found by simulations. In a single trajectory one considers the normal0 ized populations i (t) = i (t)/P (t) (and other density matrix elements if necessary), until a jump occurs when P (t) equals a random number  chosen uniformly on the interval betwen zero and unity. The quantum jump puts the atom in the state |a , and from here the evolution starts over again. In fig. 3, we plot  a (t) and  b (t) obtained by an average of 104 stochastic wavefunctions for the same parameters as used in fig. 2.

For a -system in free space with a branching of the decay from the upper state, there will also be a finite number of fluorescence photons emitted on the laser driven transition, corresponding to P () =   /( +   ) with ,   being the decay rates of state |b to the states |a and |c respectively, and the total number of fluorescence photons on the |b  |a transition is thus independent of the parameters of the driving field. This is different in our case, as seen in fig. 4, where P () and the mean number of flourescence photons emitted on the free space transition are plotted as function of the laser detuning from the PBG edge for different choices of the laser coupling. For a rather weak laser coupling, the transition to the atomic state |c is a Raman-process which is strongly suppressed when the laser is tuned below the band gap edge since there are then no resonant PBG-modes for the Stokes photon. A stronger laser coupling leads to an Autler-Townes splitting of level |b and population is then transferred to the PBG-continuum by a higher order process, removing the step-like character of P (). The fluorescence signal may hence probe details of the PBG structure. In conclusion we have demonstrated a technique for the solution of a problem, for which a Born-Markov master equation does not exist. We have in a parallel study derived a reduced master equation for the -system applying only the Born-approximation. The numerical solution of the resulting non-Markovian master equation yields a very poor agreement with the exact results presented here thus invalidating the use of the Born-approximation. These results will be presented elsewhere. The specific form of the structured continuum is not essential for our approach, but it is important that only one photon states of the PBG-continuum appear (a possible slow decay from state |c back to |a can only be treated if we may assume that the photon in the PBG continuum escapes before the atom is reexcited to level |b ). The simulations and the analytical expression (8) are simplified by the fact that all jumps put the atom in the same state. Our formalism, however, is perfectly capable of treating more general systems with branching of the decay from state |b to multiple states |aj . This implies that the index a is replaced by the set of indices aj with the corresponding enlargement of the set of equations (4) and (8). The no-jump evolution and the associated delay function, following a jump to a given level aj , are then readily computed. The MCWF technique has been applied to nonMarkovian problems through the solution of Markovian master equations for enlarged model systems [17]. Our situation, however, is different, since without ever having a master equation we have, by recourse to conditioned wavefunction dynamics, been able to obtain the atomic density matrix. We anticipate that by combination of the ideas in ref. [17] and in this paper, a wide class of non-Markovian problems may become tractable.

Let us comment on the atomic dynamics obtained in fig. 3. After an initial transient evolution, the populations  a,b (t) approach zero in a non-exponential way. The fluorescence signal on the |b  |a transition thus vanishes as opposed to the case of a two-level atom in free space. In the simulations we note that no jump will occur if the random number  is smaller than P (). When this value is non-zero, each realization only exhibits a limited number of jumps since eventually the value chosen for  will be smaller than P (). The probability of having exactly k photon emissions (jumps) in a given simulated trajectory is (1 - P ())k P (), and the mean number of photons emitted per atom is P ()-1 -1. The amplitude Uc a (t) is the inverse Laplace transform of Gc a = Vc b Gba /(z -  ). In the long time-limit only the pole z =  contributes and thus 0 Uc a (t) = Vc b Gba ( )e-i t and since P () = c () we find P () =


|Vc b Gba ( )|2

The summation can be turned into an integral, which is calculated numerically.

We show that the influence of quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field vacuum on a two level atom can be measured and consequently compensated by balanced homodyne detection and a coherent feedback field. This compensation suppresses the decoherence associated with spontaneous emissions for a specific state of the atomic system allowing complete control of the coherent state of the system. PACS numbers: 03.65, 42.50.L

Attempts to control the states of quantum systems often provide new insights into the fundamental nature of quantum mechanics and reveal new aspects of the transition from classical to quantum mechanical behaviour. The reason for this is that the concept of quantum control requires us to examine details of the effects causing decoherence which may have been overlooked before. One typical effect causing decoherence is the interaction of excited atoms with the electromagnetic vacuum giving rise to spontaneous emission. It is especially important since coherence is often established by electromagnetic fields, requirering the quantum system to be open to a continuum of modes. The conventional way of dealing with the problem of decoherence in the presence of spontaneous emission is to distinguish no-photon intervals and photon emission events [1­3]. However, this is by no means the only way of observing the electromagnetic field propagating away from a quantum system. As pointed out by Ueda [4], a measurement of the emitted field which is sensitive to the vacuum state as well is logically reversible, as opposed to the sudden transition to the ground state connected with a photon detection event. Therefore it seems preferable to apply measurement schemes different from photon detection if quantum coherence is to be controlled. In this letter we consider the possibility of observing one quadrature component of the electromagnetic field propagating away from the atomic system by time resolved balanced homodyne detection. The field actually originating from the dipole oscillations of the atomic system on a timescale  which is much smaller than the lifetime 1/ of the excited atomic state is much smaller than the vacuum fluctuations observed on this timescale. Thus it is possible to interpret the fields measured as quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field impinging on the

system. In this sense the measurement is a measurement of the forces acting on the system and not a measurement of the system state itself. It should be possible to compensate the effect of the observed quadarature component of the electromagnetic field by a coherent field of opposite sign. However, the effect of the unobserved quadrature component must also be compensated if decoherence is to be suppressed. To find out, how this can be achieved as well, it is necessary to investigate the backaction of the homodyne detection on the atomic system. For the description of the homodyne detection process, we use a non-orthogonal measurement base, often referred to as positive value operator measure or PVOM. This type of measurement base for homodyne detection has been derived and applied in a number of publications [5­8]. Since the observed fields are small, we will only consider that part of the PVOM composed of the zero or one photon contributions. The effective non-orthogonal measurement base is given by | PVOM(n) = (2 )-1/4 exp[- | vacuum + n2 ] 4  , (1)

n | nin = 1 

where  is the field amplitude of the coherent field mode emitted by the local oscillator during the time segment  considered in the measurement and n is the measured photon number difference between the two branches of the homodyne detection setup. Note that  is related to the intensity (or photon rate) I emitted by the local oscillator by I =  / . The relation has been derived using the assumption that    1. Details of the derivation will be given elsewhere [9]. Within the zero- and onephoton subspace weak coherent fields of amplitude  are approximately given by |  | vacuum +  | nin = 1 . (2)

The measurement probability of a photon number difference n of such a coherent field can be calculated from equation (1) by p (n) = | PVOM(n) |  |2

This is a Gaussian with a variance of n2 =   and a mean value of n =   +   . If the measured value of n is identified as 2 |  | times the quadrature component of the measured light field in phase with the local oscillator, this result exactly corresponds to the quantum uncertainty of 1/4 and a shift by the component of  in phase with . This result confirms the interpretation of homodyne detection as a projective measurement of the quadrature component in phase with the local oscillator. The dynamics of the photon emission process and the interaction of a two level atom with the light field continuum can be analyzed without assuming an optical cavity or using a bath approximation by applying WignerWeisskopf theory to the complete system-field Hamiltonian [10]. In the following, however, we will assume fast time-resolved measurements performed on the field long before the emission probability from an excited state approaches unity. During the short time intervals  with   1, the one-photon component of the wavefunction corresponds to a photon in a field mode with a rectangular envelope: zero field amplitude for distances r from the atomic system with r > c and a constant probability of finding a photon at distances of 0 < r < c . Therefore, the photon possibly emitted during the time interval  is in a well defined mode. Thus it is possible to write down the wave function which evolves from the light field vacuum and an arbitrary state of the two level atom given by ~ | (0) = cE | E; vacuum + cG | G; vacuum , (4)

Since   1, the squared length of this state vector which corresponds to the probability of measureing n is approximately independent of the system state and is given by the vacuum distribution, n2 1 exp[-  ]. p(n)   2  2  (7)

The major contribution to the change of the state of the atomic system conditioned by the measurement is given  by the amplitude proportional to  . The higher order terms do have some effect on timescales of 1/, corresponding to a large number of measurement intervals  . These effects will be discussed elsewhere [9]. In the following we will concentrate on the short time fluctuations effective on a timescale of  . If the normalized system state is written as | (0) + | ( ) , such that | ( ) is the change of the system state orthogonal to | (0) , then this change is approximately given by  n 2  ~ c c | E - c | G | ( )  -  E || E G . (8)

~ where | G is the atomic ground state and | E is the excited state in the interaction picture, i.e. without the phase dynamics at the frequency 0 of the atomic transition. After the time interval  , the entangled state of the atomic system and the electromagnetic field is | ( ) = ~ cE (1 -  /2) | E; vacuum  + cG | G; vacuum + cE  | G; n0 = 1 . (5)

This is the complete quantum mechanical state as it evolves unitarily according to the Hamiltonian of WignerWeisskopf theory. The PVOM given in equation (1) may now be applied to determine the change in the state of the atomic system conditioned by a measurement of n in the homodyne detection during the time interval  . The wavefunction | ( ) of the atomic system after the measurement reads | ( ) = PVOM(n) | ( ) n2 = (2 )-1/4 exp[-  ] 4  ~ cE (1 -  /2) | E  n )|G +(cG + cE   . (6)

Since the probability distribution of measurement results n is a Gaussian, this equation describes a diffusion process. Statistically, the diffusion steps cancel on average, causing decoherence because the uncertainty of the actual path chosen by the system dynamics increases with each unknown step. In our scenario however, the length and the direction of each step has been measured by homodyne detection. We can therefore deduce the evolution of the pure state of the atomic system. In this sense the description of the quantum measurement process is a quantum trajectory description as introduced in [3,11] and applied to problems of continuous feedback scenarios in [12]. It has not been derived from a master equation of the open system, however, and the field-atom interaction is described using the Schroedingers equation of Wigner-Weisskopf theory, retaining the full atom-field entanglement up to the projective measurement. In order to visualize the diffusion step, it is useful to describe the state of the atomic system by its Bloch vector s, defined as sx = 2Re sy = 2Im ~ |E G| ~ |E G| (9a) (9b) (9c)

~ sz = | E |  |2 - | G |  |2 ,

where Re(·) and Im(·) denote the real and imaginary part, respectively. sz is the expectation value of the population inversion and sx and sy are the in-phase and the out-of-phase dipole moments of the atomic system, respectively. The change in the Bloch vector of the atomic

2

system s conditioned by a measurement of n within the time interval  is then given by     sz + 1 - s2 sx x  n  -sx sy  .  sy  =  (10) || -sx - sx sz sz A representation of this diffusion step on the Bloch sphere is shown in figure 1. The linear part of this change in the Bloch vector corresponds to a Rabi rotation around sy . It is exactly equal to the effects of a coherent field with an amplitude of n/ | 2 |. The non-linear part is shown in figure 2. For positive n, this contribution draws the Bloch vector towards the sx = +1 pole of the Bloch sphere. For negative n, the Bloch vector moves towards the sx = -1 pole. It is possible to interpret this effect of the quantum fluctuations on the atomic system as an epistemological effect of information on the in-phase dipole component sx gained in the measurement. Positive values of n make a positive dipole component sx more likely and negative values of n make a negative dipole component sx more likely. Although the information obtained in a single measurement is almost negligible, the relative suppression of the amplitude of one dipole eigenstate and the corresponding amplification of the amplitude corresponding to the other dipole eigenstate causes a change in the state of the atomic system unless the system is already in an eigenstate of the dipole component with sx = ±1. The relative smallness of the dipole field compared to the quantum fluctuations makes this measurement a weak measurement in the sense discussed by Aharonov and coworkers in [13]. Even though the non-linear dependence of the diffusion step on the previous state of the atomic system prevents a state independent compensation of quantum fluctuations, the measurement is still logically reversible in the sense of [4]. It can be compensated if the previous state of the system is known with sufficient precision. In the following, we shall focus on atomic system states with sy = 0. For such states, sy is also zero and the whole diffusion process takes place in the sx , sz plane. The diffusion steps may then be identified as rotations around the sy axis. By defining the angle  such that cos  = sz and sin  = sx , the diffusion step in the sx , sz plane may be written as  =  n (1 + cos ).  || (11)

to each measurement. The feedback field f necessary to ¯ stabilize a state of the atomic system with  =  is given by ¯ n0 , f (n0 ) = -(1 + cos ) 2|| (12)

where n0 is the measurement result associated with the quantum fluctuations which are to be compensated by the feedback term. Each time interval  is therefore associated with a diffusion step caused by the quantum fluctuations and a time delayed feedback which compensates the diffusion step. The total field interacting with the atomic system is given by a coherent state of field amplitude f (n0 ). This corresponds to vacuum-state quantum fluctuations shifted by f (n0 ). Consequently, the measurement result nnext corresponding to the time interval next during which the feedback field acts on the system will be composed of a stochastic effect of the quantum fluctuations nqf and a shift next caused by the feedback field nnext = nqf + next = nqf + 2 |  | f (n0 ). (13)

This rotation of the Bloch vector conditioned by the measurement of n is equivalent to a Rabi rotation around the sy axis proportional to the quadrature component measured in the homodyne detection. Despite the quantum mechanical dependence of this Rabi rotation on , it is possible to compensate the effects of the quantum fluctuations by simply reversing the rotations corresponding 3

Since the feedback effect itself should not be compensated, only the contribution of the quantum fluctuations nqf should be applied for the determination of the subsequent feedback field. Effectively, the atomic system now interacts with a series of light field modes initially in weak coherent states corresponding to vacuum fluctuations shifted by the feedback field. The quadrature component of the field in phase with the local oscillator is measured, revealing the amplitude of this component of the fluctuations. The feedback then correlates the average field of the next light field mode interacting with the system with the measured quadrature component of the fluctuations. In a classical system this compensation would be insufficient since the out-of-phase quadrature component of the fluctuating field is unknown. In the quantum mechanical case the information obtained is complete. Instead of causing uncontrollable changes in the system state, the effect of the quantum fluctuations corresponds to a weak measurement correlating the information gained in the field measurement with the information about the system state. This effect is therefore predictable and can be compensated. The sum of the measured fluctuations and the feedback field reveals which part of the feedback field is necessary to compensate the changes associated with the weak measurement of sx : n ¯ n . + f (n) = - cos  2|| 2|| (14)

The state dependence of the weak measurement can be illustrated in terms of the three most typical cases:

¯ Dipole eigenstate. For cos  = 0 the system is in an eigenstate of the in-phase dipole component sx . No measurements of sx , whether weak or strong, will change this. Therefore, the compensating field necessary to suppress the effects of quantum fluctuations is equal to the compensation of the classically expected Rabi rotation. Also note that a coherent field along the unknown field quadrature would not affect this state, since the Bloch vector is parallel to the axis of Rabi rotations caused by fields ±/2 out of phase with the local oscillator. ¯ Ground state. For cos  = -1 no feedback is necessary for stabilization. This means that the effects of the Rabi rotation and the weak measurement associated with a homodyne detection result n automatically compensate each other. This is a result of the fact that the ground state is polarized by the field in such a way that the dipole emissions interfere distructively with the field. At the same time, the observed field makes a dipole more likely which emits radiation interfering constructively with the fluctuations. This effect may also be understood in terms of energy conservation. The ground state atom absorbs the field by the distructive interference of dipole emission and incoming field, but at the same time it emits radiation associated with the quantum fluctuations of the dipole variables. Both effects cancel and energy conservation is preserved. ¯ Excited state. For cos  = +1, the feedback necessary to compensate the weak measurement effects is equal to the feedback necessary to compensate the Rabi rotations. The reason for this is that the excited state is polarized by the field in such a way that the dipole emissions interfere constructively with the field. At the same time, the measurement makes such a dipole more likely. Consequently the effect of the quantum fluctuations is doubled. In terms of energy conservation the excited state atom amplifies the field and emits additional radiation associated with the quantum fluctuations of the dipole. The instability of the excited state is thus related to its linear response to the light field which implies gain instead of absorption. The feedback field corrects this property by effectively reversing the sign of the susceptibility, overcompensating the loss in energy associated with the field amplification and establishing a stability equivalent to that of the ground state without feedback. In conclusion, we have shown that homodyne detection of the electromagnetic field propagating from a single two level atom with a known initial quantum state reveals the changes induced in the state of the atom by quantum fluctuations. In the sx , sz plane of the Bloch vector representation of the atomic system, randomly fluctuating forces cause rotations around the sy axis. This effect corresponds to that of a coherent driving field and can consequently be compensated by Rabi rotations of opposite sign induced by a feedback field. The decoherence caused by quantum fluctuations can be suppressed completely with a precision limited only by the time delay 4

between the emission of the field and the measurement by homodyne detection. Even though one quadarature component of the light field remains unobserved, we have demonstrated that quantum control of an arbitrary state of a two-level atomic system is possible by simply applying a coherent feedback field.

This is a Gaussian with a variance of n2 =   and a mean value of n =   +   . If the measured value of n is identified as 2 |  | times the quadrature component of the measured light field in phase with the local oscillator, this result exactly corresponds to the quantum uncertainty of 1/4 and a shift by the component of  in phase with . This result confirms the interpretation of homodyne detection as a projective measurement of the quadrature component in phase with the local oscillator. The dynamics of the photon emission process and the interaction of a two level atom with the light field continuum can be analyzed without assuming an optical cavity or using a bath approximation by applying Wigner-Weisskopf theory to the complete system-field Hamiltonian10 . In the following, however, we will assume fast time-resolved measurements performed on the field long before the emission probability from an excited state approaches unity. During the short time intervals  with   1, the one-photon component of the wavefunction corresponds to a photon in a field mode with a rectangular envelope: zero field amplitude for distances r from the atomic system with r > c and a constant probability of finding a photon at distances of 0 < r < c . Therefore, the photon possibly emitted during the time interval  is in a well defined mode.

This is the complete quantum mechanical state as it evolves unitarily according to the Hamiltonian of Wigner-Weisskopf theory.

This rotation of the Bloch vector conditioned by the measurement of n is equivalent to a Rabi rotation around the sy axis proportional to the quadrature component measured in the homodyne detection. Despite the quantum mechanical dependence of this Rabi rotation on , it is possible to compensate the effects of the quantum fluctuations by simply reversing the rotations corresponding to each measurement. The feedback field f necessary to stabilize a state of the atomic system with ¯  =  is given by ¯ f (n0 ) = -(1 + cos ) n0 , 2|| (14)

A representation of this diffusion step on the Bloch sphere is shown in Fig. 1. The linear part of this change in the Bloch vector corresponds to a Rabi rotation around sy . It is exactly equal to the effects of a coherent field with an amplitude of n/ | 2 |. The non-linear part is shown in Fig. 2. For positive n, this contribution draws the Bloch vector towards the sx = +1 pole of the Bloch sphere. For negative n, the Bloch vector moves towards the sx = -1 pole. It is possible to interpret this effect of the quantum fluctuations on the atomic system as an epistemological effect of information on the in-phase dipole component sx gained in the measurement. Positive values of n make a positive dipole component sx more likely and negative values of n make a negative dipole component sx more likely. Although the information obtained in a single measurement is almost negligible, the relative suppression of the amplitude of one dipole eigenstate and the corresponding amplification of the amplitude corresponding to the other dipole eigenstate causes a change in the state of the atomic system unless the system is already in an eigenstate of the dipole component with sx = ±1. The relative smallness of the dipole field compared to the quantum fluctuations makes this measurement a weak measurement in the sense discussed by Aharonov and coworkers in13 . Even though the non-linear dependence of the diffusion step on the previous state of the atomic system prevents a state independent compensation of quantum fluctuations, the measurement is still logically reversible in the sense of4 . It can be compensated if the previous state of the system is known with sufficient precision. In the following, we shall focus on atomic system states with sy = 0. For such states, sy is also zero and the whole diffusion process takes place in the sx , sz plane. The diffusion steps may then be identified as rotations 3

where n0 is the measurement result associated with the quantum fluctuations which are to be compensated by the feedback term. Each time interval  is therefore associated with a diffusion step caused by the quantum fluctuations and a time delayed feedback which compensates the diffusion step. The total field interacting with the atomic system is given by a coherent state of field amplitude f (n0 ). This corresponds to vacuum-state quantum fluctuations shifted by f (n0 ). Consequently, the measurement result nnext corresponding to the time interval next during which the feedback field acts on the system will be composed of a stochastic effect of the quantum fluctuations nqf and a shift next caused by the feedback field nnext = nqf + next = nqf + 2 |  | f (n0 ).

(15)

Since the feedback effect itself should not be compensated, only the contribution of the quantum fluctuations nqf should be applied for the determination of the subsequent feedback field. Effectively, the atomic system now interacts with a series of light field modes initially in weak coherent states corresponding to vacuum fluctuations shifted by the feedback field. The quadrature component of the field in phase with the local oscillator is measured, revealing the amplitude of this component of the fluctuations. The feedback then correlates the average field of the next light field mode interacting with the system with the measured quadrature component of the fluctuations. In a classical system this compensation would be insufficient since the out-of-phase quadrature component of the

fluctuating field is unknown. In the quantum mechanical case the information obtained is complete. Instead of causing uncontrollable changes in the system state, the effect of the quantum fluctuations corresponds to a weak measurement correlating the information gained in the field measurement with the information about the system state. This effect is therefore predictable and can be compensated. The sum of the measured fluctuations and the feedback field reveals which part of the feedback field is necessary to compensate the changes associated with the weak measurement of sx : n ¯ n . + f (n) = - cos  2|| 2|| (16)

The state dependence of the weak measurement can be illustrated in terms of the three most typical cases: ¯ Dipole eigenstate. For cos  = 0 the system is in an eigenstate of the in-phase dipole component sx . No measurements of sx , whether weak or strong, will change this. Therefore, the compensating field necessary to suppress the effects of quantum fluctuations is equal to the compensation of the classically expected Rabi rotation. Also note that a coherent field along the unknown field quadrature would not affect this state, since the Bloch vector is parallel to the axis of Rabi rotations caused by fields ±/2 out of phase with the local oscillator. ¯ Ground state. For cos  = -1 no feedback is necessary for stabilization. This means that the effects of the Rabi rotation and the weak measurement associated with a homodyne detection result n automatically compensate each other. This is a result of the fact that the ground state is polarized by the field in such a way that the dipole emissions interfere destructively with the field. At the same time, the observed field makes a dipole more likely which emits radiation interfering constructively with the fluctuations. This effect may also be understood in terms of energy conservation. The ground state atom absorbs the field by the destructive interference of dipole emission and incoming field, but at the same time it emits radiation associated with the quantum fluctuations of the dipole variables. Both effects cancel and energy conservation is preserved. ¯ Excited state. For cos  = +1, the feedback necessary to compensate the weak measurement effects is equal to the feedback necessary to compensate the Rabi rotations. The reason for this is that the excited state is polarized by the field in such a way that the dipole emissions interfere constructively with the field. At the same time, the measurement makes such a dipole more likely. Consequently the effect of the quantum fluctuations is doubled. In terms of energy conservation the excited state atom amplifies the field and emits additional radiation associated with the quantum fluctuations of the 4

dipole. The instability of the excited state is thus related to its linear response to the light field which implies gain instead of absorption. The feedback field corrects this property by effectively reversing the sign of the susceptibility, overcompensating the loss in energy associated with the field amplification and establishing a stability equivalent to that of the ground state without feedback. If the quantum state of the system does not correspond to the state for which the diffusion step is suppressed by the feedback, the total effect of quantum fluctuations ¯ and a feedback signal given by cos  may be expressed by a general diffusion step on the Bloch sphere. This diffusion step reads     ¯ sx - cos sz + 1 - s2 x  n  sy  =   . (17)  -sx sy || ¯ s + cos s - s s
z x x z

¯ Note that the diffusion step for any state with sz = cos  is perpendicular to the sz axis, indicating that the feedback stabilizes this value of the inversion expectation value sz regardless of the phase of the dipole oscillations relative to the local oscillator. In conclusion, we have shown that homodyne detection of the electromagnetic field propagating from a single two level atom with a known initial quantum state reveals the changes induced in the state of the atom by quantum fluctuations. In the sx , sz plane of the Bloch vector representation of the atomic system, randomly fluctuating forces cause rotations around the sy axis. This effect corresponds to that of a coherent driving field and can consequently be compensated by Rabi rotations of opposite sign induced by a feedback field. The decoherence caused by quantum fluctuations can be suppressed completely with a precision limited only by the time delay between the emission of the field and the measurement by homodyne detection. Even though one quadrature component of the light field remains unobserved, we have demonstrated that quantum control of an arbitrary state of a two-level atomic system is possible by simply applying a coherent feedback field.

Using a cavity QED setup we show how to implement a particular joint measurement on two atoms in a fault tolerant way. Based on this scheme, we illustrate how to realize quantum communication over a noisy channel when local operations are subject to errors. We also present a scheme to perform and purify a universal two­bit gate. PACS: 03.65.Bz, 42.50-P

One of the most intriguing features of quantum mechanics is the possibility of entangling physical systems, which has both practical and fundamental implications. On the one hand, Bell's theorem [1] states that quantum mechanics and any local realist theory are incompatible based on the peculiar properties of entanglement. On the other, quantum communication and computation exploit these properties to guarantee secure communication and to construct algorithms that allow fast computations [2]. In a series of remarkable experiments the first steps towards these lofty goals have been taken [3­5]. In particular, it seems that quantum communication will have several practical applications in the near future. For example, quantum cryptography has been tested experimentally over long distances using standard telecommunication fibers [6]. This, combined with recent proposals [7,8] for exchanging quantum information between atoms and photons based on cavity QED suggests that a full quantum network including local processing and transmission of quantum data is possible. Since practical uses of quantum networks require a high degree of entanglement one might think that this is not feasible due to the presence of errors and decoherence. However, the recent discovery of quantum error correction protocols and purification schemes [9­11] shows that this is not a fundamental obstacle. In a quantum network one can classify the errors in two categories: transmission errors, i.e. those occurring during transfer of quantum information between nodes and local errors, i.e. those occurring during local processing and measurements. Since transmission errors are much more likely than local errors, one usually assumes that the latter are absent. With this assumption, noisy channels have been defined and protocols have been devised to achieve ideal transmission of quantum information [12]. Most proposals allow for quite general types of noise, and require infinitely many resources to achieve this goal. In contrast, based on a specific model for quantum communication we have proposed a protocol that requires only finite resources [8] and corrects for the physically relevant errors. Therefore,

in that physical scenario the only remaining problem is local errors. Although one could in principle use standard error correction schemes to solve this problem, this would again require infinite resources. In this work we will give a physical implementation that allows to perform local operations and measurements ideally using finite resources. The scheme is based on cavity QED and therefore can be easily connected to the previous proposal for quantum communication [7,8]. We will assume that operations acting on a single atom are error free, whereas any other operation is not. This is motivated by the experimental fact that single bit operations are much simpler than multiple bit operations [5]. First we will show how to perform a particularly useful joint measurement which is fault tolerant [13] in the sense that it operates even in the presence of errors occurring during this measurement. An essential element for this measurement is the introduction of a "red light atom" R [10] which reveals the occurrence of errors. We will also show how to implement a universal two­bit operation [14] which also involves measurements that indicate whether an error took place or not. In the former case, one has to start the procedure again, whereas in the latter case, one knows one has succeeded. Our schemes can be regarded as purification protocols [11] since with certain probability they are successful, while sometimes the information is lost. We emphasize that in applications in quantum communication the loss of information is not central, whereas the knowledge that one has reliably transmitted the quantum information is indispensable. We start by discussing the physical details of our setup. We consider two atoms, 1 and 2 inside a single cavity. The internal structure of the atoms is displayed in Fig. 1; the qubit is stored in the states |0 and |1 , and there is an auxiliary state |r . The states |1 and |r are coupled by a far­off­resonance Raman transition induced by an external laser field and the cavity mode, whereas the state |0 is not coupled by either the laser or the cavity field. The Hamiltonian describing the interaction between the atoms and the cavity mode is given, in a rotating frame at the cavity mode frequency, by H= g1 |1 2

where a is the annihilation operator for the cavity mode, and g1,2 are the effective coupling constants of the Raman transition. In the following, we will consider that a laser pulse of duration t1 = /g1 is applied to atom 1 and then another laser pulse of duration t2 = /g2 is applied to atom 2 [15]. Denoting by |0 cav and |1 cav the 1

Li (tj , tj ), where i = 0, 1 and j = 1, 2. In Ref. [8], the validity of (5) has been demonstrated for the present model using the quantum trajectories approach. Here, as a simple example, we illustrate this stationarity property in the context of photon absorption: we consider a cavity mode coupled to a bath of oscillators in the vacuum state |E  |0 (i.e., at zero temperature). We assume a linear coupling Hamiltonian H = a a +
k

where we have considered only the cases in which the first atom is in |0 1 or |1 1 and the second atom is in |0 2 or |r 2 , since this will be sufficient for our purposes. Note that if the first atom is in the state |0 1 nothing will change. However, if it is in |1 1 , then it will be transferred to -i|r 1 . Then, if the second atom is in |r 2 , then it will be transferred to the state -i|1 2 , whereas if it is in |0 2 , it will not change its state and a cavity photon will remain in the cavity. In reality there will be errors. Since we are considering a far­off resonance Raman transition, the most important ones will be photon losses either at the mirrors or by leaking out of the cavity. As in our previous work [8] we will also consider systematic errors in the detuning, timing, laser pulses, phase shifts, etc. It is straightfoward to account for these errors in Eq. (2) by including the state of the environment and different operators acting on it, as well as adding new terms in the last two lines which describe the effect of photon loss (see below). On the other hand, we will also need single­ atom operations involving the three atomic levels. As mentioned in the introduction, we will concentrate here on errors occurring in processes involving two bits. In the first part of this Letter, we will be interested in the following situation: atom 2 is initially in state |0 2 , and is transferred to state |r 2 ; then the process (2) takes place, followed by two single­atom operations, namely -|r 1  |1 1 and |r 2  |0 2 in the first and second atom, respectively. Hence, ideally we have |0 1 |0

where |E denotes the initial state of the environment (including the cavity mode), and the operators L act on this state. We used that one can optically pump the state |r 1 to the state |1 1 after the whole procedure. Note that with this notation this process is formally equivalent to the photonic channel introduced in Ref. [16]. In the following we will assume the environment operators L0,1 fulfill the stationary property for two consecutive operations
(2) (1) L1 L0 |E

where c and ck are c­numbers. Note that L0,1 only depend on t but not on the initial time t. Moreover, they commute and therefore they satisfy (5). The stationary property is related to the zero temperature of the reservoir, which for optical frequencies is a good approximation even at room temperature. On the other hand, one can verify that systematic errors also fulfill (5) since the corresponding L0,1 will be c­numberas only depending on t but not on t. Our goal is to use (4) to perform ideal joint measurements and entanglement operations as are required in quantum communication via a photonic channel [8,16]. In this scheme, one has to perform a local joint measurement on two atoms to check whether they are in the state |0 |0 or not. It must be implemented such that an error occurring during this measurement will be detected by the measurement itself. To be specific, let us consider two atoms in a state | = |c |Ec + |0 1 |0 2 |Ea , where |Ec,a denote unnormalized states of the environment, and |c = |0 1 |1 2 + |1 1 |0 2 with  and  arbitrary coefficients. The goal is to make a filtering measurement of the state |0 1 |0 2 , so that with certain probability the state of the atoms is projected onto the |c which is the one we want to keep intact. In order to perform the joint measurement we need the red light atom, R, initially prepared in the state |0 R . We use (4) between atoms 1 and R, and then between atoms 2 and R [See Fig. 2(a)]. This gives the transformation |0 1 |1 2 |0 |1 1 |0 2 |0 |0 1 |0 2 |0

starting at times t1,2 , of duration t1,2 , respectively. (j) Here we have used the short hand notation Li  2

where we have left out the state of the environment. Now a single­atom measurement on atom R in the state |1 R

or |0 R reveals whether the joint state of atoms 1 and 2 was in the subspace spanned by |0 1 |1 2 and |1 1 |0 2 , or a photon loss took place, respectively. In the first case, the state after the measurement will become |  (|0 1 |1 2 L1 L0 + |1 1 |0 2 L0 L1 )|Ec , = |c L1 L0 |Ec ,

where we have used (5). We emphasize that the errors that may occur during the joint measurement either factor out (operators L1 and L0 ) or are projected out (terms containing La ). Let us now show how this measurement can be used in the implementation for quantum communication proposed in [8]. In that case one needs the same threelevel atoms, and the transmission between atom 1 in the first node (cavity) and atom 2 in the second node is performed by using an appropriate laser pulse to transfer |1 1  |r 1 , producing one cavity photon. This photon then travels to the second cavity, where it can induce the inverse transition in a second atom, |r 2  |1 2 to which the time inverse laser pulse is applied. Finally, we transfer |r 1  |1 1 in atom 1. Levels |0 1 and |0 2 are not coupled by the laser field. Using the same notation as before, this transmission can then be summarized as (4) but with local operators L replaced by the corresponding transmission operators T |0 1 |0 |1 1 |0

on atoms 2 and a, namely checking whether they are in the state |0 2 |0 a . In case they are not found in this state, a single ion measurement on atom a (in the basis |0 ±|1 ) leaves atoms 1 and 2 in a maximally entangled state. The joint measurement requires entanglement, and therefore is susceptible to errors. However, we can use instead our implementation of this joint measurement using the red light ion in cavity 2 [see Fig. 2(b)]. Repeating the transmission (10) and the subsequent measurement (7) until no photon loss was detected (the red light ion is found in the state |1 R ), yields, after having measured atom a in the basis |0 a ±|1 a , the state | 12 = |0 1 |0 2 ± |1 1 |1 2 . With this EPR state one can already distribute a random secret key using the Ekert protocol [18] for quantum cryptography [19]. For certain applications in quantum communication and quantum computing a two­bit universal gate is required, since when combined with one­bit operations this is sufficient for any unitary operation [2]. This gate cannot be implemented using Eq. (4) since there the state |1 |1 is absent as input state, whereas in the gate this state has to be present. We show now how to perform the universal gate |0 1 |0 |0 1 |1

We expect that in any realistic situation ||Ta || > ||La ||. In [8] we showed how, using this channel, one can send quantum information perfectly provided local operations and measurements are perfect. Here we will show how to accomplish the same goal using noisy local operations and the joint measurement described above. We will concentrate on producing a distant EPR pair entangling two atoms in different nodes [see Fig. 2(b)]. We consider one atom (1) in the first cavity and two atoms (2 and a) in the second cavity. Starting from state |0 1 + |1 1 [17], we use the channel (9) between atoms 1 and 2; then we interchange |0 1  |1 1 in atom 1; then we use again the channel (9) between atom 1 and atom a; finally, we reverse |0 1  |1 1 in atom 1. Using this procedure we obtain the map [8] (|0

with the present implementation in the presence of errors. The gate consists of three steps: (i) A single atom operation on atom 2 exchanges |1 2  |r 2 while leaving the state |0 2 unchanged; (ii) we perform a conditional operation using the cavity mode such that the state |1 1 |0 2  -|1 1 |0 2 by applying (2) twice; (iii) we apply the inverse of step (i). Note that, according to the evolution given by (1), if the initial state is |1 1 |0 2 the cavity photon produced the first time will be absorbed again by atom 1 the second time, yielding a minus sign, as desired. In reality there will be errors due to photon losses, phase shifts of the states involved, and imperfect state transfer. After applying the gate one obtains, including these errors, |0 |0 |1 |1

The last two terms in (10) arise from photon loss errors, and can be detected by performing a joint measurement 3

The "photon loss" errors Lr0,r1,rr can be detected by measuring if the first atom is in state |r 1 . In order to perform the gate in the presence of all these errors we apply (13) four times but changing |0  |1 first in atom 1, then in atom 2 and again in atom 1, after subsequent applications. Moreover, in the last one we change the phase of the laser field acting on atom 2 by  in the second part of step (ii) so that no extra minus sign is added to the state |1 1 |0 2 [therefore, this fourth application performs just the (noisy) identity operation in order to

symmetrize the errors]. If no error is found during the whole procedure (i.e. population in state |r 1 ) we obtain

Using the same arguments as in (5), one can check that all these operators are identical. Thus, once no error was found the gate worked perfectly. So far, we used the stationary properties (11) and (5) for transmission and local operations. It is important to realize that, even if the former one (11) does not hold, one can still establish a perfect EPR pair, since we have shown here how to purify all local operations (including the gate) needed for the procedure developed in [16]. On the other hand, if also (5) would not hold, one can establish an entangled state whose degree of entanglement is limited by the degree to which (5) is satisfied. In summary, we have shown how perform joint measurements in the presence of errors in a cavity QED implementation. The scheme works even if errors occur during the measurement itself. We have shown how to apply this proposal in quantum communication to achieve perfect transmission over a nosiy channel including local errors. Using the same implementation, we have also presented a universal two­bit gate that operates perfectly in the presence of errors.

Abstract
We present a numerical method for investigating the non-perturbative quantum mechanical interaction of light with atoms in two dimensions, without a basis expansion. This enables us to investigate intense laser-atom interactions with light of arbitrary polarization without approximation. Results are presented for the dependence of ionization and high harmonic generation on ellipticity seen in recent experiments. Strong evidence of stabilization in circular polarization is found. 32.80.Fb, 32.80.Wr, 42.50.Hz

In the last ten years the interaction of intense laser light with atoms has been of great interest because of the many novel non-perturbative phenomena that have been observed, such as Above Threshold Ionization (ATI), High Harmonic Generation (HHG) and Stabilization [1]. The strongly non-perturbative nature of all these phenomena makes theoretical analysis difficult. However, considerable success has been made in using semi-analytic approaches and numerical methods for integrating the Schr¨dinger equation. The numerical o approach has been used extensively in the past ten years due in part to the increase in available computing power, the lack of approximations (except for those inherent to the Schr¨dinger equation and the dipole approximation) and the rather limited applicability of o analytic approaches. Despite the success of the numerical methods most investigations have dealt with only linearly polarized light: the reason for this is that at least two dimensions are needed in the case of arbitrary polarization, so established one-dimensional approaches [2] are inappropriate. Also, current three-dimensional approaches [3­6] are unable to deal with the enormous basis set needed to represent adequately the evolving wave function unless a parallel supercomputer [7] is used. The approach used by many authors [3] to describe atomic dynamics in strong laser fields expands the atomic wave function into sums of products of radial wave functions (channels) and angular factors. These channels are coupled together by the very strong laser field, and for linear polarization, the channel couplings lead to tri-diagonal sparse matrices amenable to efficient numerical solution. This approach entirely fails for polarizations other than linear, as the matrix sparseness properties totally disappear [8]. Recent experiments [9,10] on the very strong dependence of high harmonic generation on polarization ellipticity demand theoretical approaches to intense field ionization going beyond the existing methods which rely on linear polarizations. In this letter, we introduce a method for integrating numerically the two dimensional Schr¨dinger equation without o using a restrictive basis expansion. This enables us to study light of arbitrary polarization and realistic frequencies, interacting with an atom. Fully quantum mechanical results for ionization and high harmonic generation are presented for circular and elliptically polarized 2

light, showing the strong ellipticity dependence seen in recent experiments [9,10]. Also, we show that in the intermediate regime between tunneling and multiphoton ionization the ionization dependence on ellipticity is opposite to that seen with purely tunneling dynamics; this may be critical for experiments towards generating attosecond pulses. As in all studies of this kind the starting point is the Schr¨dinger equation (atomic units o are used throughout): i  1 (x, y, t) = - t 2 2 2 + 2 x2 y - a2 1 + (xE sin t + yE cos t)f (t) (x, y, t), + x2 + y 2 (1) where (x, y, t) is the two dimensional wavefunction, f (t) the pulse envelope and  the ellipticity. The second term on the right hand side is the smoothed Coulomb potential [2] used to avoid numerical problems associated with the singularity at x = y = 0 (a = 0.8 so that the ground state has the same binding energy as hydrogen, i.e. -0.5 a.u.). The pulse envelope, f (t), used here is a 2-cycle linear turn-on followed by 2 cycles of constant intensity and then a 2-cycle linear turn-off, which ensures no residual drift motion in the free electron displacement. The ellipticity is defined such that  = 0 represents linear polarization along the x-axis and  = 1 circular. Equation 1 is integrated using a method analogous to that implemented by Grobe and Eberly [11] and others in their studies of one-dimensional two-electron systems in which both electrons are restricted to one dimension. In our case there is only one electron with two degrees of freedom. The core of the approach is the split step method [12] in which the time evolution operator is split into kinetic and potential operators: U(t) = exp[-iT t/2] exp[-iV t] exp[-iT t/2] + O(t3 ), (2)

where T is the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian (including the dipole interaction, in a `minimal coupling' form) and V the potential part. The action of the kinetic operator is efficiently carried out in Fourier space, while the action of the potential operator is carried out in real space. An absorber is used to remove any part of the wavepacket reaching the boundaries, 3

so that artificial reflections are avoided. It is assumed that any wave function reaching the end of the grid box represents ionization, and so the remaining norm gives the necessary information about the amount of ionization occurring. This means that any population in high lying Rydberg states may also be removed; however, this is negligible for the parameter regime of interest here, as we have verified by varying the box dimensions. In all the cases presented, the initial wave function is the ground state, found by imaginary time integration. A more detailed discussion on various computational aspects can be found in ref. [11]. In Fig. 1 we show the wavepackets generated after 3.5 cycles of evolution for the previously described pulse shape with laser light of wavelength 526 nm ( = 0.0867 a.u.), i.e., the wavelength of a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser and intensity 3.51 × 1014 W cm-2 (0.01a.u.). For the case of linear polarization it is clear that the wavepacket is concentrated about the polarization axis, but there is a non-negligible width due to transverse wavepacket spreading. Interestingly, side lobes can be seen in the wavepacket; these are formed by a combination of the slow transverse spreading, the relatively fast laser driven motion in the polarization direction and the Coulomb attraction (rescattering). The behaviour of the wavepacket created by circular polarization is very different. The packet resembles a spiral with modulations within the tail, formed as the wavepacket streams away from the atom down the potential barrier in the radial direction. As well as being interesting in their own right the wavepackets show pictorially that the recollisions necessary for efficient HHG can only occur for light with   0 [9]. The complex structure of the wave function in the linear polarization case reflects the fact that rescattering from the atomic core, according to the recollision model of HHG [13­15], produces strong time-dependent interference patterns in the vicinity of the atomic core, which are responsible for much of the structure in the spectrum of HHG [16]. Those interferences are absent in the circular polarization case, as is clear from Fig. 1(b), due to the fact that the probability of rescattering with the atomic core is negligible. We have observed a smooth transition from the recollision behaviour resulting from linear polarization to the swirling tail of the circular polarization, by integrating the wavepacket dynamics for ellipticities ranging from 0 to 1. 4

This fact can be shown explicitly by investigating the dependence of ionization and HHG spectra on ellipticity. This is shown in Fig. 2: in (a), for a fixed intensity of 0.01a.u. the normalization at the end of the pulse is plotted as a function of ellipticity, where the results have been scaled such that the normalization for the linear case ( = 0) equals unity. One has to keep in mind that since the intensity is kept constant for varying ellipticity, the amplitude of the electric field in the initial (linear) polarization direction changes. The reduced ionization in the initial direction is compensated by the possibility of electron ejection in all other directions. The result is a net increase of total ionization yield, especially for such high intensities that Over the Barrier Ionization (OBI) occurs. This effect is even greater if equal electric field amplitudes are compared rather than equal intensities. In this case the probability of ionization is obviously enhanced, as the electron can escape from the atom by tunneling through or over the barrier at any time in the direction of the instantaneous electric field. Clearly, for these parameters we find that as the ellipticity is increased the amount of ionization increases by a factor of approximately 3. Past experiments [17,18] have found that the threshold for ionization is higher for circular polarization. However, these experiments have been carried out in the tunneling regime where standard tunneling theory [19] predicts higher ionization rates for linear polarization. The results presented here are not strictly within the tunneling regime (due mainly to the relatively high frequency) and represent new behaviour. In Fig. 2 (b), we have used the same parameters as in Fig. 1 (the spectra are rescaled such that the fundamental peak is equal to one in intensity for each ellipticity), and now find that the harmonics act as seen in experiments [9,10]: as the ellipticity is increased, the harmonics become less intense until no harmonics are discernible from noise. Only the first 4 harmonics can be seen for  = 0.6, and the peaks are found to be rather broad, indicating that they are generated on a short timescale. In addition there seems to be a correlation between the ionization behaviour and the ellipticity beyond which the harmonics are destroyed: the normalization flattens out after approximately  = 0.7 which is also the ellipticity at which the harmonics disappear. 5

To highlight the very different behaviour of the ionization for various ellipticities we have calculated the normalization at the end of the pulse for linear and circular polarization as a function of intensity (Fig. 3). At low intensities we see the expected perturbative multiphoton behaviour, observed in experiment [10], that linear polarization produces a greater amount of ionization because of the transition rule restrictions on circular polarization transitions. However, as the intensity is increased to the critical intensity for over the barrier ionization (around 0.005a.u. of intensity) we observe that the behaviour changes such that circular polarization becomes more efficient in producing ionization and indeed for much of the intensity range shown it is at least an order of magnitude greater. Note that the normalization curve for linear polarization is not smooth: this was previously observed by Pindzola and D¨rr [20] and LaGattuta [21] and assigned to AC Stark shifted resonances o and threshold effects. However,we find, as in ref. [21] that for circular polarization these structures do not occur, perhaps because of the more restrictive circular dipole selection rules, at least in the perturbative regime of intensities. Finally, we observe a minimum in the normalization implying that stabilization is occurring. This is in agreement with calculations made by Pont and Gavrila [22] for circular polarization using time-independent high frequency Floquet theory. The lowest frequency which they have used is  = 0.125 a.u., while we have found stabilization, albeit not to the same degree, for a frequency 1.5 times smaller. Interestingly, for the same parameters linear polarization shows no signs of stabilization. This may be due to the atom not surviving the passage through `death valley' [23]. We are currently investigating adiabatic stabilization with much higher frequencies and intensities, the results of which will be presented elsewhere. In summary, we have investigated numerically, with two-dimensional ab initio calculations, the dependence of ionization and HHG on ellipticity. In particular, we have found that the harmonics are destroyed by elliptical light, as seen in recent experiments [9,10]. In a parameter regime where the tunneling picture is not entirely valid, circular polarization produces a greater amount of ionization than linear. We have also found evidence 6

for stabilization in circularly polarized light in qualitative agreement with previous timeindependent calculations. The method we propose opens up the possibility of studying fully quantum-mechanically wavepacket evolution in time-dependent ellipticities proposed for the generation of ultrashort pulses of harmonics [24]. As well as this exciting prospect, the unified description of the strong-field phenomena, based on the exact wavepacket dynamics presented here, will open the way to resolve problems associated with, e.g., the accuracy of the `two-step' model for harmonic generation, time-dependent laser polarization, control of harmonic generation in time, ionization with elliptical light, elliptical stabilization of wavepackets, angular distribution of photoelectrons in ATI, and many other important questions in strong-field physics that could be addressed only by approximate and speculative theoretical models in the past.

We propose a formulation of an absorbing boundary for a quantum particle. The formulation is based on a Feynmantype integral over trajectories that are confined to the non-absorbing region. Trajectories that reach the absorbing wall are discounted from the population of the surviving trajectories with a certain weighting factor. Under the assumption that absorbed trajectories do not interfere with the surviving trajectories, we obtain a time dependent absorption law. Two examples are worked out. PACS numbers: 02.50.-r, 05.40.+j, 05.60.+w. The purpose of this letter is to propose a Feynman-type integral to describe absorption of particles in a surface bounding a domain. The need for such description arises for example in scattering theory, in the description of a photographic plate, in the double slit experiment, in neutron optics, and so on. The optical model [1,2] is often used to describe absorption in quantum systems. This model is based on analogy with electro-magnetic wave theory. It is not obvious that the methods of describing absorption in Maxwell's equations carry over to quantum mechanics because the wave function of a particle does not interact with the medium the way an electromagnetic wave does. In particular, in classical quantum theory, unlike in electromagnetic theory, the wave function does not transfer energy to the medium. The main tenet of our Feynman-type integral description of absorption is that trajectories that propagate into the absorbing surface for the first time are considered to be instantaneously absorbed and are therefore terminated at that surface. The population of the surviving trajectories is therefore discounted by the probability of the absorbed trajectories at each time step. The process of discounting can be explained as follows. In general, if the trajectories are partitioned into two subsets, the part of the wave function obtained from the Feynman integral over one cannot be used to calculate the probability of this subset, due to interference between the wave functions of the two subsets. However, in the physical situation under consideration, such a calculation may be justified. Our procedure, in effect, assumes a partition of all the possible trajectories at any given time interval [t, t+ t] into two classes. One is a class of bounded trajectories that have not reached the 1 surface by time t + t and remain in the domain, and the other is a class of trajectories that hit the surface for the first time in the interval [t, t+ t]. We assume that the part of the wave function obtained from the Feynman integral over trajectories that hit the surface in this time interval no longer interferes with the part of the wave function obtained from the Feynman integral over the class of bounded trajectories in a significant way. That is, the interference is terminated at this point so that the general population of trajectories can be discounted by the probability of the terminated trajectories. This assumption makes it possible to calculate separately the probability of the absorbed trajectories in the time interval [t, t+ t]. The discounting process constitutes a coarse-graining procedure for a large quantum system, describing the absorber. The assumptions we make can be viewed as the mathematical expression of quantum irreversibility of absorption, because the absence of interference separates the two classes of trajectories for all times. Thus the trajectories that stop to interfere can be discounted from the population of trajecotires inside the domain. Our model is only one aspect of irreversible processes. Under the above assumptions the discounting procedure leads to a Feynman-Kac integral with a killing measure [6], which in turn leads to a Schr¨dinger equation o with zero boundary conditions on the absorbing surface and complex valued energy which depends on the wave function of the class of bounded trajectories at each time t. We obtain a decay law that is not an exponential rate, in general. It reduces to a rate only for a single energy level initial condition. In this case, the wave function is

a solution of the Schrdinger equation with infinite walls o at the absorbing boundaries and constant complex potential that depends on the initial energy. If, however, there are two initial energy levels, the decay law depends on both energy levels and contains an oscillatory term with beat frequency. Similar beats in the decay law occur if the initial wave function contains any number, finite or infinite, of energy levels. We consider another example, of a Gaussian packet of free particles traveling with a given mean velocity toward an absorbing wall. We find that the packet is partially reflected and partially absorbed and calculate the reflection coefficient. The reflected packet results from trajectories that never reached the wall. This behavior is mainly due to classically forbidden trajectories. In contrast to scattering, this is not the same reflection as that in a finite or infinite barrier, because reflection in a finite barrier depends on the shape of the barrier and reflection in an infinite barrier is totally elastic, whereas the reflection we obtain is discounted by a finite constant factor. Consider the class a,b of continuously differentiable functions x( ) for 0   <  such that a  x( )  b for all 0   <  and such that x(0) = xI , x(t) = x. The class a,b consists of bounded trajectories that begin at xI and end at x. We define the Feynman integral over the class a,b by K(x, t) =
a,b

The following derivation is formal, a strict derivation can be constructed along the lines of [7]. We expand the function KN -1 (xN -1 , tN -1 ) in (2) in Taylor's series about x to obtain KN (x, t) =

Obviously, eqs.(4)-(6) are identical to those of a particle bounded by infinite potential walls. The same result was obtained in [8] for the case V (x) = 0 by a different method. Our method of calculation is essential for calculating the Feynman integral with absorbing boundaries. First, we calculate the discretized Feynman integral to survive (not to be absorbed) the time interval [0, t] and to find a trajectory in time t at a point x in the interval [a, b]. According to the above assumptions, the discretized Feynman integral for trajectories initially inside the interval [a, b] that propagate to the endpoint a for the first time in the time interval [0, t] is

For a particle with a single energy level the wave function decays at an exponential rate proportional to the energy. However, if there are more than just one level, the exponent contains beats.

Next, we consider a Gaussian-like wave packet of free particles traveling toward an absorbing wall at x = 0 with positive mean velocity k0 . That is, in order to maintain the zero boundary condition on the wall the initial wave function is the difference between two antisymmetric Gaussians relative to the absorbing wall. It follows that

Now, it follows from eqs.(8) that the wave function of the surviving trajectories at time t is given by 3

(16)

Thus R = lim [1 - P (t)] > 0,
t

that is, the wave packet is only partially absorbed. This means that the "reflected" wave consists of trajectories that turned around before propagating into the absorbing wall where absorption occurs. The discount of the wave function occurs when the packet is at the wall, as can be seen from eqs. (15) and (16). Thus R plays the role of a reflection coefficient. This is neither the usual reflection coefficient for a finite potential barrier nor that for an infinite barrier. The two examples can be combined into a simple experimental setup of a cavity with absorbing walls and an absorbing detector at one end. A particle travelling along the axis of the cavity fits the first example in the the transverse direction and the second example in the direction of the cavity axis. Thus the decay law is the product of the two decay laws described above. Further examples and applicatins are discussed in [4]. Discussion Absorption in a surface is different than absorption in the bulk across the surface in that Feynman trajectories do not propagate across the surface in the former but do in the latter case. This letter is concerned with absorption in a surface. Absorption in the bulk requires a separate theory. The basic assumption in our model is that Feynman trajectories that propagate into the surface are instantaneously absorbed and the probability of the remaining trajectories is discounted by the probability of the absorbed trajectories at each time step. Thus the instantaneous discount factor is proportional to the probability density at the surface at each time step. The proportionality constant, denoted , is a characteristic length, in analogy with the scattering length, the mean free path [2], or a typical Compton wavelength. It serves as a fudge parameter in this theory and is expected to be a measurable quantity. It may depend on the energy of the particles, on the temperature of the absorbing medium, and so on. Our derivation does not start with a Hamiltonian, but rather with an action of bounded trajectories. The resulting decaying wave function corresponds to a classical quantum system with a Hamiltonian whose potential is

complex valued and time dependent. This potential depends on the initial energies of the system [12]. Thus, in our formalism, the trajectories are given an actual physical interpretation as the possible trajectories of a quantum particle. This is analogous to the trajectory approach to diffusion in probability theory [5,10,11]. Quantum mechanics without absorption is recovered from our formalism when the absorbing boundaries are moved to infinity. In higher dimensions, quantum mechanics without absorption can be recovered from our formalism by putting absorbing regions with variable density in a half space, say. As the density increases, the boundary of the half space becomes a totally absorbing wall and as the density decreases to zero, quantum mechanics is recovered. The examples demonstrate the expected phenomenon that particles that reach the absorbing boundary are partially reflected and partially absorbed. In either case the decay pattern of the wave function seems to be new. Acknowledgment: The authors thank Yakir Aharonov for useful discussions.

Abstract

It has been recently shown [M. Robnik and L. Salasnich, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen., 30, 1719 (1997)] that the WKB series for the quantization of angular momentum L converges to the exact value L2 = h2 l(l + 1), if ¯ 2 2 summed over all orders, and gives the Langer formula L = h (l + 1/2)2 at ¯ the leading order. In this work we solve the eigenvalue problem of the angular momentum operator by using the supersymmetric semiclassical quantum mechanics (SWKB), and show that it gives the correct quantization already at the leading order.

The Wentzel­Kramers­Brillouin (WKB) semiclassical method is one of the most useful techniques for solving the Schr¨dinger equation. It allows o to obtain approximate analytic expressions for the wavefunctions and energy spectra1) Usually, what is used is the torus quantization, which is just the leading order of the h-expansion of the WKB method. Higher terms can be ¯ calculated with a recursion formula in one degree systems, but are generally unknown in systems with more than one degree of freedom (see Robnik and Salasnich2) ). It has been observed since a long time that the WKB method, in its leading approximation, when applied to three­dimensional spherically symmetric problems yields wrong results, unless one replaces the correct value L2 = h2 l(l+1) with the Langer expression3) L2 = h2 (l+1/2)2 . Further, when ¯ ¯ higher order terms are included, the Langer correction needs modifications at each order of approximation. It has recently been shown by Robnik and Salasnich2) that the Langer term and its first corrections are the first terms of an infinite series. By making a guess on the higher order terms, they could sum all the series, recovering the exact quantum result. In the framework of the supersymmetric semiclassical quantization (SWKB), Comtet, Bandrauk and Campbell4) obtained at the leading order the exact quantization of the radial part of the Kepler problem by using the correct value L2 = h2 l(l +1). The aim of the present work is to complete their result. ¯ In fact, we show that also the exact quantization of the angular momentum is obtained at the first order of the SWKB expansion. The eigenvalue equation of the angular momentum operator is ^ L2 Y (, ) = 2h2 Y (, ) , ¯ with ^ ^ L2 = P2 + ^2 P  2 + cot() = -¯ 2 h 2 2   sin () Y (, ) = T ()eim , 3 - h2 ¯ 1 2 . sin2 () 2 (2) (1)

After the substitution (3)

we obtain the equation T  () + cot()T  () + 2 - m2 T () = 0 , sin2 () (4)

where m is the azimuthal quantum number. This equation is exactly solvable. Its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are well known from any text of quantum mechanics (see, e.g. Landau and Lifshitz5) ): the former are 2 = l(l + 1), l  m; the latter are the associate Legendre polynomials. Now we will briefly outline the WKB expansion of Eq. (4). First of all, it is important to notice that in (4) does not appear h, therefore an expansion ¯ in powers of this parameter is not possible. To override this difficulty a small parameter  is introduced6) : 2 T  () + 2 cot()T  () + 2 - m2 T () = 0 . sin2 () (5)

The parameter , which will be set to 1 at the end of the calculation, has formally the same role of h as ordering parameter, and is equivalent to taking ¯ 2 the limit    and/or m  . With the further substitution 1 T () = exp  Sn n  ,  n0
 (S0 )2 + 2 - n     Sk Sn-k + Sn-1 + cot()Sn-1 = 0 , k=0





(6)

we find

m2 sin2 ()

=0, n>0.

(7) (8)

The exact quantization is obtained by requiring the uniqueness of the wave function:  dS =
k=0

dSk = 2i n ,

(9)

where we have now set  = 1. This integral is a complex contour integral which encircles the two turning points on the real axis. Obviously, it is 4

derived from the requirement of the uniqueness of the complex wave function T . If one stops to the leading order dS0 = i 2 - m2 sin2 () d = 2i n + 1 2 . (10)

The integral is easily calculated and the condition  = n + m + 1 1 =l+ 2 2 (11)

is obtained. Otherwise, one may go further, compute all the terms Sn and recover the exact result 2 = l(l + 1), as done by Robnik and Salasnich6) . After these preliminaries, we enter into the main topic of this paper: we shall repeat the calculation using the supersymmetric theory (for a monography about the subject of SUSY quantum mechanics see, e.g., Junker7) ). In order to put (4) in a standard form we make the replacement T () = and obtain F  () + 2 + 1 1 1 + - m2 2 4 sin () 4 F () = 0 . (13) F () sin() , (12)

This equation has the standard form of the one­dimensional Schr¨dinger o 2 equation with h = 2M = 1. Its eigenvalues are ( + 1/4). ¯ To perform the SWKB for the Eq. (4) or (13), it is necessary to calculate the ground state wave­function T0 () = sinm () and its eigenvalue 0 = m(m + 1). Then we can define the supersymmetric (SUSY) potential () = - with F0 () = T0 () sin() . 5 (15) d ln(F0 ()) 1 cot() , =- m+ d 2 (14)

(18)

where 0 = m(m + 1) is the eigenvalue of the ground state of Eq. (4). We do not give here the proofs since they are standard results of the SUSY theory (see Ref. 7 and references therein for details). A further important remark is that  gives rise to shape­invariant partner potentials: V- and V+ depend, besides the independent variable , from the parameter m. A couple of V- , V+ , depending upon an independent variable x and a set of parameters {a0 }, are called shape­invariant if the relation holds: V- (a0 , x) = V+ (a1 , x) + R(a1 ) , (19)

with {a1 } a new set of parameters and R a function of a1 but not of x. In our case we obtain V- (m, ) = V+ (m - 1, ) - 2m , (20)

It has been shown by Dutt, Khare and Sukhatme8) , and by Barclay and Maxwell9) , that for this class of potentials: i) exact quantization rules are attained at the first order, and the results may be expressed in analytical form; ii) higher order terms are identically null. Let us apply the WKB formalism to H- of Eq. (16); the main lines of the calculation follow Eqns. (5­10), but a careful analysis (see Ref. 7, ch. 6

6) shows that the quantization conditions are to be modified: to the leading order one gets

which, with the position l = n + m, yields the result sought. Summarizing, we have demonstrated that, by using SUSY quantum mechanics, the eigenvalue problem of the angular momentum operator can be solved exactly within the semiclassical approximation and at the lowest order. Even if these results are a consequence of the theorems of SUSY theory, we think that an explicit derivation is not devoid of interest since, notwithstanding the importance of the three­dimensional spherically symmetric problems in physics, a detailed analysis of its angular part has always been lacking in literature until the work of Robnik and Salasnich6) . That work, however, suffered from the fact that its results were based upon some conjectures which, though fully reasonable, were not rigorously demonstrated. 7

Introduction

The semiclassical methods used to solve the Schr¨dinger problem are of exo treme importance to understand the global behaviour of eigenfunctions and energy spectra, since they allow to obtain analytic expressions. The leading semiclassical approximation (torus quantization) is just the first term of a certain h­expansion, which is called WKB (Maslov and Fedoriuk 1981). ¯ Recently it was observed (Prosen and Robnik 1993, Graffi, Manfredi and Salasnich 1994, Robnik and Salasnich 1997a­in the following this work will be referred to as I) that the torus quantization generally fails to predict the individual energy levels (and the eigenstates) within a vanishing fraction of the mean­energy level spacing. This conclusion is believed to be correct for general systems, including the chaotic ones. Therefore, a systematic study of the accuracy of semiclassical approximation is very important, especially in the context of quantum chaos (Casati and Chirikov 1995, Gutzwiller 1990). Since this is a difficult task, it has been attempted for simple systems, where in a few cases even exact solutions may be worked out (Dunham 1932, Bender, Olaussen and Wang 1977, Voros 1993, Robnik and Salasnich 1997a). Robnik and Salasnich (1997b) (this work will be referred to as II) dealt with the WKB expansion for the Kepler problem: it was proved that an exact result is obtained once all terms are summed. In particular, the torus quantization (the leading WKB term) of the full problem is exact, even if the individual torus quantization of the angular momentum and of the radial Kepler problem separately are not, because the quantum corrections (i.e. terms higher than the torus quantization) compensate mutually term by term. In the paper II Robnik and Salasnich had to do a conjecture about the higher terms of the WKB expansion. This conjecture is perfectly reasonable but not rigorously proved. In this work our goal is to prove that the same result of II can be reached rigorously by means of a slightly modified procedure. In the framework of the supersymmetric semiclassical quantization (SWKB), 2

Comtet, Bandrauk and Campbell (1985) obtained at the leading order the exact quantization of the radial part of the Kepler problem by using the correct value L2 = h2 l(l + 1). In the last section we complete the result ¯ of Comtet, Bandrauk and Campbell (1985). In fact, we show that also the exact quantization of the angular momentum is obtained at the first order of the SWKB expansion.

Eigenvalue problem for the angular momentum

The eigenvalue equation of the angular momentum operator (Landau and Lifshitz 1977) is ^ L2 Y (, ) = 2h2 Y (, ) , ¯ (1) with ^ ^ L2 = P2 + ^2 P  2 + cot() = -¯ 2 h 2 2   sin () Y (, ) = T ()eim , we obtain T  () + cot()T  () + 2 - m2 T () = 0 . sin2 () (4) - h2 ¯ 1 2 . sin2 () 2 (2)

After the substitution (3)

We shall consider the azimuthal quantum number m as fixed. As well known, Eq. (4) is exactly solvable. Its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are known from any text of quantum mechanics (see, e.g. Landau and Lifshitz 1977): the former are 2 = l(l + 1), l  m; the latter are the associate Legendre polynomials. The WKB expansion for Eq. (4) has been studied in II; it was shown that higher­order terms quickly increase in complexity. The method of solution 3

is to find an analytical recursive expression for all the higher­order terms, to sum the entire infinite series, and show that it is convergent to the exact result. Instead of the original function T we shall use the associated function F: F () T () = , (5) sin() from which we obtain F  () + 2 + 1 1 1 + - m2 2 4 sin () 4 F () = 0 . (6)

This equation has the standard form of the one­dimensional Schr¨dinger o 2 equation with h = 2M  1. Its eigenvalues are ( + 1/4). We make the ¯ substitution of variable: x =  + /2, and the positions U = m2 - 1/4, E = 2 + 1/4. Then Eq. (6) becomes - F  (x) + U F (x) = EF (x) . cos2 (x) (7)

This is the main result of our paper, because the problem of the WKB quantization of Eq. (7) has already been dealt with in I. As we shall show, from I one proves that: i) Eq. (7) can be solved exactly ; ii) a semiclassical expansion of (7) may be carried on to all orders (i.e. all terms may be exactly and analytically computed and summed); iii) the exact and the semiclassical eigenvalues are the same.

3

WKB series for the angular momentum

We observe that in Eq. (7) does not appear h, therefore an expansion in ¯ powers of this parameter is not possible. To override this difficulty a small parameter  is introduced: - 2 F  (x) + U F (x) = EF (x) . cos2 (x) 4 (8)

This parameter , which will be set to 1 at the end of the calculation, has formally the same role of h as ordering parameter. It has already been used ¯ in II to deal with the WKB expansion of (4). The formal WKB expansion for F reads: i  (9) n (x)n , F (x) = exp  n=0 and we obtain a recursion relation for the phases:
 (0 (x))2 = E - n    k (x)n-k (x) + n-1 (x) = 0 , k=0

U , cos2 (x) n>0.

(10) (11)

The quantization condition is obtained by requiring that the wavefunction be single valued:


d =
k=0

dk = 2n ,

(12)

where n is an integer number. All odd terms higher than the first vanish when integrated along the closed contour since they are exact differentials (Bender, Olaussen and Wang 1977) d2k+1 = 0 , k>0. (13)

It may be proved by induction (see I) that the solution of (10­11) is
  n (x) = (0 )1-3n Pn (cos(x)) sinf (n) (x) ,

(14)

with f (n) = 0 for n even, f (n) = 1 for n odd,

the terms proportional to Cn,l , l > 0 disappear after integration. The integral (12) becomes (see I for more details)

which is the expected result. Please note that the WKB series is convergent for |x| > 1, thus for m > 0. We observe that the ­expansion is equivalent to the 1/U­expansion (this is clear from the structure of Eq. 8). In the limit U   it is easy to get the WKB expansion to the first order, which gives 2 = (l + 1/2)2 , i.e. the torus quantization of the angular momentum (Langer 1937).

SWKB quantization of the angular momentum

To perform the supersymmetric semiclassical quantization (SWKB) of Eq. (4) or (6), it is necessary to know the ground state wave­function T0 () = 6

sinm () and its eigenvalue 0 = m(m + 1). Then we can define the supersymmetric (SUSY) potential () = - with F0 () = T0 () sin() . (23) From  the two SUSY partner potentials and Hamiltonians may be defined H± = - d2 + V± () , d2 (24) (25) 1 d ln(F0 ()) cot() , =- m+ d 2 (22)

V± () = 2 () ±  () .

It is possible to prove (see Junker 1996 and references therein for details) 0 that: i) the ground-state energy of H- , E- , vanishes; ii) all other eigenvalues of H- , E- , coincide with that of H+ ; iii) the spectrum of H- and that of (7) differ by a constant: E- = 2 + 1 1 - 2 + 0 4 4 , (26)

where 0 = m(m + 1) is the eigenvalue of the ground state of Eq. (4). Now we apply the SWKB formalism to H- of Eq. (24). At the leading order one gets

and, by using Eq. (26) with 0 = m(m + 1), we get 2 = (n + m)(n + m + 1) , which yields the exact quantization, after the position l = n + m. (31)

Conclusions

The three­dimensional central potentials are fundamental in physics, and also the semiclassical treatment of them has implications in many fields: factorization properties of the one­dimensional potentials (Infeld and Hull 1957), general properties of the semiclassical quantization of the systems with more than one degree of freedom, both integrable or not. Nevertheless, until the paper of Robnik and Salasnich (1997b), no detailed study had been done on half of the problem, the WKB quantization of the angular part. Our present paper completes that work because it gives a rigorous proof of the convergence of the WKB series to the exact result. Moreover, in the last section, we have demonstrated that, by using SUSY quantum mechanics, the eigenvalue problem of the angular momentum operator can be solved exactly at the lowest order within the semiclassical approximation.

Abstract
The nonnegativity of the density operator of a state is faithfully coded in its Wigner distribution, and this places constraints on the moments of the Wigner distribution. These constraints are presented in a canonically invariant form which is both concise and explicit. Since the conventional uncertainty principle is such a constraint on the first and second moments, our result constitutes a generalization of the same to all orders. Possible application in quantum state reconstruction using optical homodyne tomography is noted. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 42.50.Ar, 42.50.Wm, 42.50.Lc

The uncertainty principle exhibits a fundamental manner in which the quantum description of nature departs from the classical one. For the canonical pair of variables (^, p) the q ^ Heisenberg commutation relation [^ , p] = i¯ leads, for any state | , to the unbeatable q ^ h limitation (^) q

where q =  |^|  , ^ = q - q , and so on. Every Gaussian pure state saturates this ^ q q ^ ^ inequality. An important attribute of the uncertainty principle (1) is that it is invariant under all real linear canonical transformations, just as the canonical commutation relation is. This inequality can be generalized in a naive manner to higher orders in q , p. For any ^ ^ ^ B and state | we have the Schwartz inequality ^ pair of hermitian operators A, ^ A2 ^ B2  ^^ ^^ AB + B A 2

^ ^ It is saturated if an only if A | and B | are linearly dependent as vectors. Clearly, (1) ^ is a particular case of (2) corresponding to A = q - q , B = p - p . Clearly, the choice ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2 2 2 2 ^ ^ ^ ^ A = q - q , B = p - p will lead to a higher order uncertainty principle involving q 4 , ^ ^ ^ 4 2 2 p ; the Fock states |n , being eigenstates of q + p , will be expected to saturate this higher ^ ^ ^ order uncertainty principle. That they indeed do so can be explicitly verified. One may indeed produce any number of such naive generalized uncertainty principles by ^ ^ making various choices for A, B in (2). But every one of them will suffer from the deficiency of not being invariant under linear canonical transformations. Further, there seems to be no reasonable sense in which the set of all such generalizations based on (2) can be considered to be complete. The purpose of this Letter is to present a generalization of the uncertainty principle which largely overcomes these difficulties. This is achieved by applying to the Wigner quasiprobability [1] concepts and results from the classical problem of moments [2]. The final result is a nested sequence of constraints on the moments of the Wigner distribution. These constraints are tailored to capture the positivity of the density operator of a quantum state. Equivalently, a given real phase space distribution has to necessarily meet these constraints in order to qualify to be a bonafide Wigner distribution. It should be appreciated that the higher moments of the Wigner distribution are no more objects of purely academic interest. An enormous progress in quantum state reconstruction using optical homodyde tomography has been achieved in the last few years: the Wigner distribution of a state can now be fully mapped out [3], as has been demonstrated by several groups [4­7]. There exist rigorous and mathematically sophisticated approaches to the quantum mechanical moment problem [8]. But our considerations here are explicit and take full advantage of the canonical invariance underlying the Heisenberg commutation relation. Details of a classical probability density (x) are coded in its moments n = dxxn (x). An important result in the problem of moments is this [2]: given a sequence of numbers it qualifies to be the moment sequence of a bonafide probability distribution if and only if the symmetric matrix defined below is nonnegative: 2

This can be broken into a sequence of positivity conditions on the determinants of the submatrices of , which in turn can be viewed as a nested sequence of constraints on the moments n ; and these constraints are tailored to capture the pointwise nonnegativity of (x). Reconstruction of (x) from its moment sequence is the other part of the classical problem of moments [2]. In quantum mechanics, the state is described not by a true probability density in phase space, but by one of several possible quasiprobabilities [1]. The earliest, and probably the most prominent, quasiprobability is the one introduced by Wigner [1]. It is intimately related to the Weyl ordering rule of association between the algebra A of functions f (q, p) of the ^ ^ q ^ phase space variables and the algebra A of operator valued functions F (^, p) of the canonical ^ ^ operators. The rule is specified first through the one to one correspondence eq+ p  eq+ p for plane waves, and then extended linearly to the entire algebra using Fourier techniques. The Weyl rule could equally well be specified in the monomial basis instead of the plane ^ wave basis through the association q m pn  Tm,n for m, n = 0, 1, 2, · · · where the Weyl ^ ^ ^ ordered monomial Tm,n is the coefficient of (m!n!)-1 m  n in the Taylor expansion of eq+ p . ^ This is an isomorphism between A and A only at the level of vector spaces but not at the ^ level of algebras. In particular, the product of two Tm,n 's is not another monomial but a linear combination of monomials [9]: ^ ^ Tm,n Tm ,n =

The intimate connection between Weyl ordering and Wigner distribution is this: tr(^Tm,n ) = ^ dq dp q m pn W (q, p) . (5)

^ That is, the quantum mechanical expectation of the Weyl ordered monomial Tm,n is precisely the mn-th moment of the Wigner function. By linearity, similar relation holds for any pair ^ q ^ f (q, p), F (^, p) related by Weyl ordering. ^ The monomials Tm,n are hermitian, and transform in a simple manner under the group Sp (2, ) of real linear canonical transformations. This group can be identified with SL (2, ), the group of 2 × 2 real matrices with unit determinant. Sp (2, ) acts identically on the pairs ^ (q, p) and (^, p), and this action induces linear transformation in the algebras A and A in q ^ the natural manner. The set of homogeneous polynomials of order 2j in q and p (being linear combinations of q j-s pj+s for s = -j, -j + 1 , · · · , j ) transform linearly among themselves under this ^ ^ transformation, leading to the spin-j representation of Sp (2, ) in A. The Tm,n 's in A m n ^ decouples transform in the same manner as the q p 's in A, and thus the vector space A 3

^ ^ ^ ^ 1 into a direct sum of invariant subspaces under Sp (2, ): A = V (0)  V ( 2 )  V (1)  · · · ^ ^ (j) is of dimension 2j + 1, and is spanned by js = Tj-s,j+s with s running over ^ Clearly, V the range s = -j, -j + 1 , · · · , j. It acts as the carrier space for the spin-j representation ^ ^ of Sp (2, ) in A. Thus, every spin-j representation of Sp (2, ) occurs in A once and only once. ^ It is convenient to arrange the j,s's for fixed j into a 2j + 1 dimensional column vector (j) ^ ^  and then, for any chosen J, arrange these columns into a grand column vector J of dimension (J + 1)(2J + 1). Let the (2j + 1) × (2j + 1) matrix K (j) (S) denote the spin-j representation for S  Sp (2, ). Since the defining representation of Sp (2, ) is the spin- 1 representation, we have 2 1 K ( 2 ) (S) = S. Let KJ (S) be the block diagonal matrix of order (J + 1) × (2J + 1) with 1 ^ diagonal blocks K (0) (S) = 1, K ( 2 ) (S), · · ·, K (J) (S). Then the action of Sp (2, ) in A has the concise description ^ ^  J - KJ (S)J ,

^ Here, q m pn = Tm,n stands for the average of q m pn with the Wigner distribution as the weight as in (5). In other words, MJ is the matrix formed out of the moments of the Wigner distribution function, of order atmost 2J. We now prove the important fact that the nonnegativity of the density operator  forces ^ the hermitian matrix MJ to be a nonnegative matrix, for every J. For a given fixed value of J consider the operator
J j

j=0 s=-j

where cjs are arbitrary c-number expansion coefficients which can be arranged into a (J + 1) (2J + 1) dimensional column vector C. Now form the operator ^ ^ ^  =   =

which is hermitian nonnegative by construction. Since   0, we necessarily have tr(^ )  0, ^ ^ for every choice of the coefficients {cj,s }. But from (8), (10) we find tr(^ ) = ^
j,s j  ,s

c cj  s Mjs,j s . js

That is, tr(^ ) = C  MC for every C. This completes the proof that   0 implies MJ  0 ^ ^ for every J. A little reflection should convince the reader that this is the generalized form of the uncertainty principle we have been after, and we state it as follows: Generalized Uncertainty Principle:­ Let MJ be the hermitian c-number matrix formed out of the moments of the Wigner distribution of a state  in accordance with the prescription (8). ^ Then MJ  0 , J = 0, 1 ,1,··· 2 (11)

For a given state not all moments will exist in general. It is clear that in such a case where MJ is finite only for all J  Jmax , our generalized uncertainty principle should be modified 1 to read MJ  0, J = 0, 2 , · · ·, Jmax . While the hermiticity and unit trace properties of  are reflected in the reality and nor^ malization of the Wigner distribution, the generalized uncertainty principle presented in the concise matrix form (11) exhibits the constraints on the moments q m pn of the Wigner distribution resulting from the nonnegativity of . While the conventional uncertainty prin^ ciple is such a constraint on the first and second moments, ours is a generalization to all orders. It should be appreciated that the canonical commutation relation enters MJ in (11) through (4). The following mathematical lemma is helpful in analyzing the content of this generalized uncertainty principle: A hermitian matrix Q of the block form Q= A C C B

is positive definite if and only if A and B - C A-1 C  are positive definite. The proof simply consists in recognizing the congruence Q  Q = L Q L , L= 1 0 -C A-1 1 ,

where Q is a block diagonal matrix with diagonal blocks A and B - CA-1 C  . The usual uncertainty principle (1) is contained in (11) as a particular case: it is equivalent to the condition detMJ= 1  0. Next consider the case J = 1. Use of the lemma with
2

 C  = (M 0, 2 M 0,1 ) renders MJ  MJ , where

 Now MJ  0 implies MJ  0 which in turn implies that its diagonal block M 2 , 2 - 1 1 M 2 ,0 M 0, 2  0. Written in terms of the moments, the last condition reads

which is precisely the usual uncertainty principle (1).  One more application of the lemma on the nontrivial part of MJ further strengthens the 1,1 1,0 0,1 positivity requirement on the other diagonal block M - M M to M 1,1 - M 1,0 M 0,1  C M 2 , 2 - M 2 ,0 M 0, 2 C = M 1, 2 - M 1,0 M 0, 2 .

This 3 × 3 matrix condition, together with the 2 × 2 matrix condition (12), constitutes a complete statement of the generalised uncertainty principle involving moments of all order upto and including the fourth. It is clear that yet another application of the lemma, starting with MJ= 3 , will lead to a 2 positivity statement on a 4 × 4 matrix which, together with (12) and (13), will constitute a complete statement of our uncertainty principle on moments of all orders upto and including the sixth. Evidently, this reduction algorithm based on the above lemma can be continued to any desired value of J, and hence upto any desired (even) order of the moments,eventually rendering MJ block diagonal. We see from (6), (8) that MJ transforms in the following manner under S  Sp (2, ): S: MJ - KJ (S) MJ KJ (S)T . (14)

The nonnegativity of MJ is manifestly preserved under this transformation. Thus, our generalized uncertainty principle is invariant under linear canonical transformations. Further, the reduction algorithm suggested by the lemma is invariant under linear canonical transfor   mations, for it follows from (6) and (14) that M j,j transforms to K j (S)M j,j K j (S)T under S  Sp (2, ). ^ An evidently useful way of reading (14) is that the components of MJ , just as the Tm,n 's, transform as tensors under Sp (2, ). And the fact that our generalized uncertainty principle is invariant under Sp (2, ) means that it is implicitly stated in terms of the invariants of these tensors. These invariants, in the classical case, have been studied in great detail by Dragt and coworkers [10]. While the nonnegativity of  implies the nonnegativity of MJ for all J, it is of interest ^ to know if nonnegativity of MJ for all J implies nonnegativity of . Phrasing it somewhat ^ differently, we may ask: Given a real normalized phase space distribution whose moments satisfy the condition MJ  0, for all J, does it follow that the phase space distribution is a bonafide Wigner distribution? ^ ^ From the very construction of MJ , it is clear that tr(^O)  0 when O is of the form  ^ ^ is a (convex) linear combination of operators in (10). By linearity, this is true also when O of this type(with nonnegative coefficients). Thus, (11) will be sufficient to characterise the Wigner distribution if the set of all such convex combinations is dense in the space of 7

nonnegative operators. Intuitively, this may appear to be the case. However, the monomials ^ Tm,n are generically noncompact, and hence a careful analysis of the issue of convergence should be made before one can make any claim in this direction. We have already referred to the intensity with which current experimental research dealing with measurement of the Wigner distribution is being pursued [4­7]. Since measurements are always accompanied by errors of various origins, it will be of interest to see to what extent the Wigner distribution reconstructed in a real experiment respects the generalised uncertainty principle. Further, it may be of interest to examine the possibility of incorporating these fundamental inequalities in the algorithm for tomographically reconstructing the Wigner distribution from measured data, in such a way as to improve the reconstruction itself. Finally, our analysis applies equally well to any other quasiprobability, provided we choose suitably ordered momomials and modify the product formula (4) accordingly.

We exploit results from the classical Stieltjes moment problem to bring out the totality of all the information regarding phase insensitive nonclassicality of a state as captured by the photon number distribution pn . Central to our approach is the realization that n! pn constitutes the sequence of moments of a (quasi) probability distribution, notwithstanding the fact that pn can by itself be regarded as a probability distribution. This leads to classicality restrictions on pn that are local in n involving pn 's for only a small number of consecutive n's, enabling a critical examination of the conjecture that oscillation in pn is a signature of nonclassicality.

Nonclassical states of the radiation field continue to receive much attention. These are states for which the P -distribution (z) is not a true probability. Prominent among the quantitative characteristics of nonclassicality are squeezing and sub-Poissonian statistics. While these involve the lower order moments of (z), there have also emerged criteria involving the higher order moments. Among these we may note the higher order squeezing criteria of Hong and Mandel [3], the related amplitude squared squeezing introduced by Hillery [4], and the generalization of the Mandel Q-parameter achieved by Agarwal and Tara [5]. There has also emerged a qualitatively different kind of criterion for nonclassicality. While pn = n|^|n , which  represents the probability of there being n photons in the state specified by the density operator , is a smooth ^ function of n for classical states like the coherent states and the thermal states, it is an oscillating function of n for nonclassical states like the squeezed states, as was exposed in the seminal work of Schleich and Wheeler [6] on interference in phase space. Oscillation in pn has since then been taken as a signature of nonclassicality [7,8]. Indeed, these oscillations have come to be known as nonclassical oscillations [9]. It should, however, be noted that this oscillation criterion for nonclassicality, though 1

insightful, has not been derived from basic principles and hence enjoys only the status of a conjecture. Its principal virtue lies in the fact that it is local in n, in contradistinction to the criteria involving the Mandel Q-parameter or its generalizations; the latter are expressed in terms of the moments of pn , and hence are global in n. For a radiation mode described by annihilation and creation operators a, a measurements of operators which ^ ^ are functions of a a (the so called phase insensitive opera^ ^ tors) do not depend on all the details of (z), but are fully determined by the angle averaged radial "marginal" distribution P(I), derived from (z) by writing z = I 1/2 ei and averaging over : P(I) = 1 2

where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . The above relation is invertible. That is, the sequence {pn } represents P(I) faithfully. For a given state, it may happen that (z) is not a true probability, but the phase averaged P(I) is a bonafide probability distribution. Such states (the Yurke-Stoler state [10] is an example) are said to exhibit phase sensitive nonclassicality. On the other hand the nonclassicality of the state may be such that it survives the process of phase averaging involved in (1), thereby rendering P(I) itself a quasiprobability rather than a true probability. Then we talk of (the stronger) phase insensitive nonclassicality. Clearly, any state with sub-Poissonian statistics is nonclassical of the phase insensitive type. The purpose of this Letter is to exhibit the totality of all the information regarding nonclassicality of a state as captured by the photon number distribution sequence

{pn } or, equivalently, by P(I). Since we work at the level of {pn }, and not (z), only states with phase insensitive nonclassicality will be said to be "nonclassical". All other states will be termed as "classical", for brevity. The key to our approach is an appreciation of the fact that {pn } is essentially the moment sequence of a (quasi) probability distribution, notwithstanding the fact that pn  0 and pn = 1, and hence {pn } can legitimately be viewed as a probability distribution over the discrete variable n. This departure from tradition leads us to derive constraints on pn which are local in n involving pn 's for only a small number of consecutive n's, and enables us to critically examine the oscillation criterion in a direct manner. Necessary and sufficient conditions for absence of (phase insensitive) nonclassicality in a state are presented, not only in terms of the sequence {pn } but also in the (dual) traditional approach involving the factorial moments of {pn }. Local constraints on classical {pn }.-- It turns out to be convenient to define a sequence {qn } in the place of {pn } through qn = n!pn , for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . It follows from (2) that {qn } is simply the moment sequence of the distribu~ tion P(I) = P(I)e-I :


classical state other than the vacuum state, cannot be orthogonal to any Fock state. To appreciate the significance of this conclusion, consider the state  = N am 0 am , ^ ^ ^^ (7)

Since pn =< n|^|n >= 0 for n < m, we con clude that  is nonclassical for every m > 0. Thus, we ^ have established the following result: all photon added states, pure or mixed, are nonclassical. There has been remarkable progress recently in quantum state reconstruction using techniques of optical homodyne tomography [13]. Thus, it is now possible to `map out' the Wigner distribution of a state using the inverse Radon transform, or reconstruct the density matrix in the Fock basis using a set of pattern functions. Schiller et al [14] report such a reconstructed  upto ^ n = 6, with qn = 0.44, 0.07, 0.26, 0.30, 1.44, 3.60, 28.80. The local conditions (5) are violated (for instance, 0.07 × 0.30  (0.26)2 ). Thus, the squeezed vacuum of Schiller et al turns out to be a nonclassical state of the phase insensitive type. That is, the nonclassicality of their state survives phase averaging, notwithstanding the fact that consideration of the Mandel Q-parameter will do no more than to simply indicate that this state is "strongly super-Poisonian" as noted by the authors. We now turn to the oscillation criterion for nonclassicality. There exist classical states for which the photon distribution {pn } is an oscillatory function of n. We may call these classical oscillations. Figure 1 shows such classical oscillations for an incoherent mixture of suitably chosen coherent states: = ^ j |j j | , j = 1 . (8)

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(5)

Written in terms of {pn }, the above condition reads pn pn+2  ( n+1 2 )p . n + 2 n+1 (6)

These are our local conditions to be necessarily satisfied by the photon distribution {pn } of any classical state. Several interesting conclusions can be drawn from these conditions which are local in n, and are saturated for every value of n by any Poissonian distribution. Suppose that we are given a state for which pn0 = 0 (and hence qn0 = 0) for some integer n0  0, and assume that the state is classical. The choice n = n0 in the local condition (5) implies that qn0 +1 = 0. Similarly the choice n + 2 = n0 implies qn0 -1 = 0. Continuing this process we find that for a classical state either pn is nonzero for every values of n, or pn = 0 for all n > 0. In other words, a

FIG. 1. Showing classical oscillations in the photon distribution for an incoherent mixture of five coherent states with j = 0.25, 0.25, 0.2, 0.18, 0.12 and corresponding |j |2 = 10, 30, 60, 90, 130. Here p(n) and q(n) stand, respectively, for pn and qn of the text. Note that qn exhibits no oscillation for this classical state

. On the other hand the photon added thermal (or coherent) state has a {pn } with no oscillation; we have nevertheless seen that it is a nonclassical state. This, however, should not tempt one to simply dismiss the oscillation criterion as being neither sufficient nor necessary for nonclassicality; for, as already noted, the virtue of this criterion does not reside in its exactitude, but rather in its distinction of being local in n. Thus, it is highly desirable to amend it suitably but without sacrificing its local character. This is easily achieved through our local conditions. To see this, note that (5) implies that {qn } for a classical state cannot have a local maximum (if it had, the inequality will be violated by allowing n + 1 to correspond to the local maximum), and hence cannot exhibit any oscillation. Thus we arrive at the desired modification: oscillation in {qn } is a sufficient condition for nonclassicality. It is {qn }, and not {pn }, that is the key to the correct oscillation criterion. Indeed, {pn } can oscillate for a classical state with amplitude limited by the extent permitted by the (n + 1)/(n + 2) factor in (6). Even period-two classical oscillations are allowed, as can demonstrated using classical states of the type (8). Finally, we apply our local conditions to a class of states obtained as superposition of two coherent states: | >= N [|z0 > +ei | - z0 >], (9)

results from the classical problem of moments to exhibit the necessary and sufficient conditions on {qn } in order that the associated state  is classical. ^ The classical moment problem, on which there exists an enormous amount of literature [17], consists of two parts: (i) to test if a given sequence of numbers qualifies to be the sequence of moments of some bonafide probability distribution, and (ii) to reconstruct a probability distribution from its moment sequence. If the probability distribution is over the semi-infinite real line [0, ), one calls it the Stieltjes moment problem. The Hamburger moment problem corresponds to the case where the probability distribution is over the entire real line (-, ). Since, I = |z|2  0, our problem of deriving the necessary and sufficient condition on the moment sequence ~ {qn } in order that P(I) is a true probability distribution is indeed a Stieltjes moment problem. Solution of this classical problem is well known [17]. To exhibit this solution, construct from the moment sequence {qn } two (N + 1)-dimensional symmetric square ~ matrices L(N ) and L(N ) as follows:   q0 q1 q2 · · · qN  q1 q2 q3 · · · qN +1    L(N ) =  . . , . . mn .  . .  . . . . . qN qN +1 qN +2 · · · q2N q1 q2 . . . q2 q3 . . . q3 q4 . . .   ~ L(N ) =  mn   · · · qN +1 · · · qN +2 . . .    .  (11)

qN +1 qN +2 qN +3 · · · q2N +1

where  is the relative phase (in the Pancharatnam [15] sense) between the two components of the superposition, and N is the normalization constant. We have qn qn+2 (1 + (-1)n cos )2 = . 2 qn+1 (1 + (-1)n+1 cos )2 (10) It is clear that our local conditions (5) are violated by | for all values of  = ±/2; by odd values of n for -/2 <  < /2, and by even values of n for the range -3/2 <  < -/2. It is well known [16] that coherent states are the only pure states for which the P-distribution (z) is a true probability. Further, the Yurke-Stoler [10] states, which correspond to  = ±/2, have Poissonian {pn } and hence possess only phase sensitive nonclassicality. Thus, what is striking about the above analysis is the inference that for all values of  = ±/2 the superposition state has phase insensitive nonclassicality, and that it is exposed by our lowest order local conditions! Necessary and sufficient condition for nonclassicality.-- ~ We showed that positivity of P(I) implies the local conditions (5) on its moment sequence {qn }. We now exploit 3

Theorem 1: The necessary and sufficient condition on the photon number distribution sequence {qn = n!pn } of a state , in order that the associated quasiprobability ^ ~ distribution P(I) is a true probability, is that the matri~ ces L(N ) , L(N ) be nonnegative: L(N )  0 , ~ L(N )  0 , N = 0, 1, 2, . . . (12)

It may be noted in passing that for the Hamburger moment problem on the entire real line (-, ), the condition L(N )  0 is both necessary and sufficient. It is immediate to relate our local condition to the ~ above theorem. Nonnegativity of L(N ) , L(N ) demands, as a necessary condition, nonnegativity of the diagonal ~ 2 × 2 blocks of L(N ) , L(N ) . This is precisely what our local conditions (5) are! It is also clear why our local conditions (5) are not sufficient: positivity of the diagonal ~ 2 × 2 blocks of L(N ) , L(N ) does not capture in its entirety (N ) ~ the positivity of L and L(N ) required in (12). We can derive the next higher level of local conditions for classicality using our necessary and sufficient conditions (12). Given the sequence {qn }, we define
2 xn = qn qn+2 /qn+1 ,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(13)

Then our first order local conditions (5) involving qn for three successive values of n simply reads xn  1, n, for any classical state. The second order local condition to be presented involves qn for five successive values of n or, equivalently, xn for three successive values of n. A necessary condition for the nonnegativity of L(N ) , ~ (N ) is that their diagonal 3 × 3 blocks (such a block L involves qn for five successive values of n) be nonnegative. After some algebra this condition can be written in terms of the xn 's as xn+1 - 1 2 ) , (14) (xn - 1)(xn+2 - 1)  ( xn+1 for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . These are our second order local conditions on {qn } or, equivalently, on {pn }. They involve three successive x s and hence five successive p s. Just n n like the first order conditions, these too are only necessary conditions for classicality, and we can similarly derive successive higher levels of local conditions. To see an interesting implication of (14), recall that a Poissonian distribution {pn }, i.e. a geometric sequence {qn }, saturates the first order local conditions and renders xn = 1 identically. We now ask whether it is possible 2 to have a classical state for which qn qn+2 = qn+1 for some 2 values of n, whereas qn qn+2 > qn+1 for other values of n. Such classical states, if they exist, can be said to be locally Poissonian at these former values of n. Suppose a classical state is locally Poissonian at some n = n0 . That is, xn0 = 1. Then two applications of (14), once with n0 = n and then with n0 = n + 2, shows that the state will cease to be classical unless xn0 +1 = 1 and xn0 -1 = 1. Continuing this process we find that xn = 1 for all n. Thus, there exists no non-Poissonian classical state which is locally Poissonian: A classical state is either everywhere locally Poissonian (xn = 1 for all n) or is everywhere locally super-Poissonian (xn > 1 for all n). In the light of this result we can now strengthen and refine our first order condition (5) by adding that for a classical state these inequalities are either saturated for all n, or they are strict inequalities for all n. Factorial moments.-- We now present a dual approach to nonclassicality based on the traditional normal ordered moments n = tr an an  . This approach will be seen to ^ ^ ^ be along the lines of Agarwal and Tara [5]. However, the conditions for nonclassicality that we present are both necessary and sufficient. Suppose we have a state  whose normal ordered mo^ -1 ments n (i.e. factorial moments k (k!) (n + k)!pn+k of pn ) are known. Our problem is to find necessary and sufficient conditions on the sequence {n } in order that the state  is classical. Transcribing n to the represen^ tation in terms of the P-distribution (z), and writing z = I 1/2 ei , we have


That is {n } is the moment sequence of P(I), in exactly the same manner in which the sequence {qn } was ~ related to P(I). And the state  being classical is equiva^ lent to P(I) being a true probability distribution. Thus, we have a Stieltjes moment problem once again, with solution parallel to the earlier one. Using the moment sequence {n }, form (N + 1)-dimensional symmetric ma~ trices M (N ) , M (N ) defined by Mjk = j+k ,
(N )

~ (N ) Mjk = j+k+1 .

(16)

where j, k = 0, 1, . . . , N and N = 0, 1, 2, . . . Theorem 2: The necessary and sufficient condition that the state  with normal ordered (i.e. factorial) moment ^ sequence {n } be classical is that M (N )  0 , ~ M (N )  0 , N = 0, 1, 2, . . . (17)

It should be appreciated that theorem 2 completes the work initiated by Agarwal and Tara [5] by improving their necessary condition for classicality (they had only the condition M (N )  0) into the necessary and sufficient condition (17). Thus, the constraints on the factorial moments {n } arising from the requirement M (N )  0 are the same as in their work. However the additional constraints on these moments arising from the positiv~ ity requirement on M (N ) are new: with N = 0 we have 2 1  0, with N = 1 we have 1 3  2 , and so on. It should be appreciated that these conditions cannot indeed be deduced from M (N )  0. ~ Considering diagonal 2 × 2 blocks of M (N ) , M (N ) we 2 obtain the classicality conditions k k+2  k+1 , for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . Clearly, these are dual to our first order local conditions (5). We may also derive conditions analogous to our second order local conditions (14), and so on. To conclude, either of the two approaches based re^ spectively on the moments of P(I) and P(I) leads to complete solution of the problem of (phase insensitive) nonclassicality as coded in the photon number distribution {pn }. It should however be appreciated that qn 's are well defined for every state whereas the factorial moments n may not be finite, for pn may not decay fast enough as a function of n. For the states for which n exists for all n, the two approaches are equivalent. Even then, it is unlikely that the connection between nonclassicality and oscillation in pn could have been so easily settled in terms of n . Finally, the first approach in terms of local conditions of pn has a distinct advantage at least in situations where, for some reason, pn is known not for all values of n. The density matrix from Ref. [14] which we analysed is such an example. The point is, even with knowledge of pn only for a finite set of values of n one can now look for signatures of nonclassicality.

Abstract It is shown that the exponential moments of the canonical phase can be directly sampled from the data recorded in balanced homodyne detection. Analytical expressions for the sampling functions are derived, which are valid for arbitrary states and bridge the gap between quantum and classical phase. The reconstruction of the canonical phase distribution from the experimentally determined exponential moments is discussed.

Introduction

Since Dirac's attempt in 1927 to introduce amplitude and phase operators in quantum mechanics [1] a number of concepts have been developed with the aim to overcome the problems resulting from the non-existence of a Hermitian phase operator (for a review, see [2]). Recently an attempt has been made to bridge the gap between two concepts which are based on essentially different approaches to the phase problem and widely used in quantum optics [3]. In the first, the phase of a radiation-field mode is defined from the requirement that phase and photon number should be complementary quantities. This first-principle definition leads to the canonical phase (also called London phase), the associated phase states being the right-hand eigenstates of a one-sided unitary exponential phase operator [4]. In the second, phase quantities are defined from the output observed in phase-sensitive measurements, such as eight-port homodyne detection. It is well known that in such a scheme the Q function [or, in the case of non-perfect detection, a smoothed Q function, i.e., an s-parametrized phase-space function with s < -1] is measured [5, 6]. The measured phase distribution can then be obtained from radially integrating the (smoothed) Q function. Whereas in the classical limit the measured phase coincides with the canonical phase, in the quantum regime the two phases significantly differ from each other in general, because of the additional noise unavoidably connected with the Q function. So, from a study of the asymptotic behaviour of the measured and canonical phase distributions in the semiclassical domain it can be anticipated that the measured distribution is at least broader than the canonical one [3]. In the quantum regime it is principally not possible to obtain the canonical phase distribution from the radially integrated Q function, but it must be related to the complete quantum state, i.e., the complete Q function as a representation of the state in the phase space. The best and perhaps ultimate method for measuring the quantum state of a traveling optical field has been four-port homodyne detection in which the quantum state is measured in terms of the quadrature-component distribution [7]. Since the quadrature-component distribution contains all knowable information on the quantum state, the various quantum-statistical properties of the system can be obtained from it. Moreover, the quadrature-component distribution is less noisy than the Q function and therefore it is more suitable for determining the quantum statistics than the Q function. The method also called optical homodyne tomography (OHT) was first used for reconstructing the Wigner function of a single-mode optical field applying inverse Radon transform [8], which requires a three-fold integration of the measured data. In the numerical calculation the standard filtered back projection algorithm is usually used, so that the reconstruction of the Wigner function is biased by data filtering. This problem does not appear and the effort is drastically reduced if the quantities that one is interested in can be directly sampled from the homodyne 2

data. In particular, the determination of the quantities and the error estimation are very fast and can be performed in real time. Systematic errors can easily be reduced to any desired degree of accuracy and the remaining statistical errors only reflect the finite number of measurement events. It has been shown that both the density matrix in the photon-number basis [9] and the moments and correlations of the photon creation and destruction operators [10] can be obtained in this way, which has offered novel possibilities of the experimental determination of the photon-number statistics of light. In contrast to the photon-number statistics, the determination of the canonical phase statistics has been an open problem. The phase statistics can of course be tried to be determined indirectly by calculating it approximately from the Wigner function, using in the reconstruction of the Wigner function the standard filtered back projection algorithm of inverse Radon transformation [11]. Another indirect method, which avoids the rather lengthy detour via the Wigner function, is the calculation of the phase statistics from the sampled density matrix in the photon-number basis [12]. However, since canonical phase and photon number are complementary quantities, there is no a priori upper bound for the density-matrix elements that can contribute to the phase statistics. Hence, large numbers of density-matrix elements must be sampled, the statistical errors of which then give rise to an error accumulation in the phase statistics such that the inaccuracies eventually dominate the result (note that the statistical error of the off-diagonal density-matrix elements increases with the distance from the diagonal). To limit the effect of inaccuracies, one must necessarily restrict the method to states of low photon numbers and appropriately truncate them. A way that remains to overcome the problem is to directly sample the phase statistics from the homodyne data. Unfortunately the canonical phase distribution cannot be related to the quadrature-component distribution in the sense of a sampling formula because the corresponding integral kernel does not exist. It has been therefore suggested to introduce the exact phase distribution as the limit of a convergent sequence of appropriately parametrized (smeared) distributions each of which can directly be sampled from the homodyne data [13]. The exact phase distribution can then be obtained asymptotically to any degree of accuracy, if the sequence parameter is chosen such that smearing is suitably weak. In practice it is therefore required that the sampling procedure is performed simultaneously for various values of the sequence parameter, each value giving rise to its own sampling function. The disadvantage of the method is rather technical, since the numerical effort drastically increases with the number of photons contained in a state. This fact makes the method effectively applies only to states with low photon numbers. Finally, it has been suggested to measure the canonical phase distribution asymptotically by replacing the local-oscillator in the homodyne detection scheme with a reference mode prepared in so-called reciprocal binomial states ­ a method that is also state dependent and hardly realizable at present [14]. 3

In this paper we show that the problem of direct determination of the canonical phase statistics from the homodyne data can be solved when it is based on the exponential phase moments (i.e., the Fourier components of the phase distribution) and not on the phase distribution itself. We show that the exponential phase moments can be directly sampled from the quadrature-component distribution, without making a detour via other quantities and without any assumptions and approximations with regard to the state. In particular, we derive analytical expression for the sampling functions and give a very simple procedure for the numerical calculation. Since the method is independent of the state, it applies to both quantum and classical fields and all fields in between in a unified way and bridges, through the universally valid sampling functions, the gap between quantum and classical phase. Needless to say that for obtaining the full information on the phase statistics, all (non-vanishing) exponential phase moments must be determined. It is worth noting that already sampling of a few low-order moments provide us with interesting information [15]. The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 the problem of direct sampling of the exponential phase moments of a classical oscillator from the quadraturecomponent distribution is studied. In Sec. 3 the theory is extended to the canonical phase of a quantum oscillator. Measurement errors are studied in Sec. 4, and in Sec. 5 numerical results of computer simulations of measurements for determining the canonical phase statistics are presented. Lengthy mathematical derivations are given in appendices.

Sampling of exponential phase moments ­ classical case

In order to gain insight into the problem of phase measurement by means of balanced homodyne detection, let us first consider the situation in classical optics. Here we can assume a proper phase-space probability W (q, p) dqdp, which can be rewritten as, on introducing polar coordinates q = r cos  and p = r sin , W (q, p) dqdp = P (r, ) drd, where P (r, ) = r W (r cos , r sin ). The phase probability distribution P () is then defined by

P () =

and the exponential phase moments k , which are given by the Fourier components of the phase probability distribution, k =

can be written as


k =

dr eik P (r, ).

(5)

In balanced homodyne detection the probability distributions p(x, ) for the field quadratures x() = q cos  + p sin  are measured. [Note that when the harmonic oscillator represents a moving particle in a harmonic potential, then  = t is valid and x(t) is the time-dependent position of the particle.] The quadraturecomponent probability distribution p(x, ) can be obtained from the phase-space probability distribution P (r, ) as, on recalling that x() = r cos(-),


p(x, ) =

2

d

0

dr P (r, ) [x-r cos(-)],

(6)

which is nothing but the well-known Radon transform, whose inversion yields the phase-space probability distribution in terms of the quadrature-component distribution. Let us now turn to the problem of direct sampling of the exponential phase moments. A quantity A can be determined from the homodyne data by means of the sampling method, if it can be related to p(x, ) as


A=

d

-

dx KA (x, ) p(x, )

(7)

with a well-behaved integral kernel KA (x, ) as sampling function. Note that p(x,  + ) = p(-x, ), so that the  integration in Eq. (8) can be restricted to a  interval. For the sake of convenience, here and in the following we prefer a 2 interval. In contrast to the full phase-space probability distribution P (r, ), which cannot be obtained from p(x, ) by a simple inversion of Eq. (6) in the form of Eq. (7), the sampling method applies to the Fourier components of the radially integrated phase-space probability distribution, i.e., the exponential phase moments k can be given by


k =

2

d

-

dx Kk (x, ) p(x, ).

Substituting in Eq. (8) for p(x, ) the expression (6), we arrive at

In order to determine the integral kernel Kk (x, ), it is convenient to introduce the Fourier decomposition


Kk (x, ) =

eil Kk,l (x).

(10)

When the phase argument  in P (r, ) is shifted towards  + 0 , i.e., P (r, )  P (r,  + 0 ), then it follows from Eq. (5) that k changes as k  e-ik0 k . Comparing this requirement with Eqs. (9) and (10), we find that Kk,l (x) must be of the form Kk,l (x) = k,l Kk (x), and hence Kk (x, ) = eik Kk (x). (11)

We now insert this expression into Eq. (9), compare the result with Eq. (5) and find that Kk (x) must satisfy the integral equation
2

d eik Kk (r cos ) = 1

(12)

for all r > 0. From Eq. (12) we can see that Kk (x) is not uniquely defined. First, any function of parity (-1)k+1 can be added to Kk (x) without changing the integral. Second, any polynomial of a degree less than k can also be added to Kk (x). As can be verified by direct substitution, a solution of Eq. (12) for odd and even k, respectively, is given by
1 K2m+1 (x) = 4 (-1)m (2m + 1) sign (x)

(13)

and K2m (x) =  -1 (-1)m+1 m ln |x| + C (14)

[m = 0, 1, 2, . . .,where C is an (irrelevant) constant.] Note that this solution ensures that the integral (8) exists for any quadrature-component distribution p(x, ) which with increasing |x| decreases at least as |x|-(1+) ,  being a (arbitrarily small) positive constant, i.e., for any physical state. Clearly, this would be not the case if, within the ambiguity mentioned, polynomials were added to the functions (13) and (14). Another reason for choosing the functions (13) and (14) is the reduction of the statistical error in a real experiment. Since this error is related to the variance of the kernel (Sec. 4.3), it is advantageous to choose kernels which are varying as slowly as possible.

Sampling of exponential phase moments ­ quantum case

It is worth noting that the results derived in Sec. 2 also remain valid for a quantized radiation-field mode, provided that W (q, p) [or in polar coordinates, P (r, )] is identified with the quantum-mechanical Wigner function. Hence, using in Eqs. (9) and (11) the functions (13) and (14) enables one to determine exponential phase moments defined by the Fourier components of the radially integrated 6

Wigner function from the homodyne data by means of the sampling method. Since the Wigner function of a quantum oscillator can attain negative values, it cannot be regarded, in general, as a proper phase-space probability distribution, and hence the radially integrated Wigner function does not represent, in general, a proper phase distribution function. As already mentioned, for a quantized radiation-field mode photon number and canonical phase are complementary variables, and in place of Eq. (3) we have P () = (2)-1 |^| ,  (15)

where  and | , respectively, are the density operator of the state and the (un^ normalizable) phase states [16]

n=0

ein |n ,

(16)

which are right-hand eigenstates of the only one-sided unitary operator ^ E = (^ + 1)1/2 a, n ^ ^ E| = ei | . (17) (18)

In Eq. (17), n = a a is the photon-number operator, a and a being the photon ^ ^^ ^ ^ creation and annihilation operators, respectively. From Eqs. (15) and (18) together with the fact that the phase states resolve the unity it is easily seen that the exponential phase moments k defined in Eq. (4) can be written as ^ k = E k (19)

for k = 1, 2, . . ., and k =  for k = -1, -2, . . .. We now combine Eqs. (17) and -k (19) and obtain [in place of Eq. (5)]

(k = 1, 2, . . .). Next, we express the quadrature-component distribution p(x, ) = x, |^|x,   (21)

in terms of the density-matrix elements in the photon-number basis. For this purpose we expand in Eq. (21) the eigenstates |x,  of the quadrature-component operator x() = 2-1/2 (e-i a + ei a ) in the photon-number basis [17], ^ ^ ^

where the functions n (x) are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic-oscillator Hamil tonian, n (x) = (2n n! )-1/2 exp(-x2 /2)Hn (x), Hn (x) being the Hermite polynomial. From Eqs. (21) and (22) we then obtain [in place of Eq. (6)]
 

p(x, ) =

n (x)m (x)m,n ei(n-m) .

(23)

Let us again assume that k can be obtained from p(x, ) according to Eq. (8). Substituting in Eq. (8) for p(x, ) the quantum-mechanical expression (23) and comparing the result with Eq. (20), we see that the kernel Kk (x, ) must be of the form (11), but now Kk (x) must satisfy the integral equation

(n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Equation (24) plays the same role for a quantum oscillator as Eq. (12) for a classical oscillator does. From Eq. (24) and the properties of the Hermite polynomials the same ambiguity in the determination of Kk (x) as in the classical case (Sec. 2) is found. Provided that a Kk (x) exists, any function of parity (-1)k+1 and/or any polynomial of a degree less than k can be added to Kk (x) in order to again obtain a solution of Eq. (24). We now turn to the problem of construction of an integral kernel that satisfies ^ Eq. (24). For this purpose we return to Eq. (19) and bring the operator E k into the normally ordered form, ^ Ek = =

~ From Eqs. (29) ­ (31) [together with Eq. (A 18)] it is seen that Kk (x) exists, ~ and it can be proved by direct substitution that Kk (x) satisfies Eq. (24). Hence we have found a solution of Eq. (24) even when the assumption made for constructing it fails (i.e., when the moments and correlations (26) do not exist for all m and ~ n, see the derivation in Appendix A). It is worth noting that both Kk (x) and Kk (x) are solutions of Eq. (24), because the polynomial Fk (x) in Eq. (28) reflects the above mentioned ambiguity in the solution of Eq. (24) and can therefore be omitted. Further, it can be shown (Appendix C) that with increasing |x| the solution Kk (x) approaches the classical one, i.e., the asymptotic behavior for large |x| of Eqs. (29) and (30), respectively, is exactly given by Eq. (13) and 9

Eq. (14). We see that Kk (x) can be used for determining exponential phase moments from the homodyne data for all states whose quadrature-component distributions p(x, ) asymptotically decrease at least as |x|-(1+) ,  > 0, i.e., for any physical state. Since Kk (x) applies to both quantum and classical systems in a unified way, the sampling method bridges the gap between quantum and classical phase. Examples of Kk (x) for various k are shown in Fig. 1. It is seen that they are well-behaved functions, which rapidly approach the classical limit and differ from it only in the small region of vacuum fluctuations. Let us comment on the numerical calculation of Kk (x) which can be performed in a straightforward manner. In particular, from Eqs.

In order to calculate Kk (x) for ~ arbitrary k it may be convenient to start from Kk (x) as given in Eq.

(36)

and use the classical limit, Eqs. (13) and (14), elsewhere. For example, for the calculation of the kernels plotted in Fig. 1 it is sufficient to chose the parameters l0 = 40 and x0 = 4, and to truncate the infinite sum in Eq. (31) for Fk (x) at l = 103 .

Nonperfect detection and measurement errors

In practice there is always a number of experimental inaccuracies that limit the precision with which the exponential phase moments can be determined. In this section we restrict attention to three kinds of inaccuracies: data smearing, discretization of the phase parameter , and finite number of measurement events (i.e., discretization of x).

10

4.1

Data smearing

Since in a realistic experiment the quadrature components cannot be measured with infinite precision, we may assume that instead of p(x, ) a smeared distribution


p(x, ; ) =

-

dy f (x - y; ) p(y, )

(37)

is obtained. In Eq. (37), f (x; ) is some positive single-peaked function and  is a parameter quantifying the smearing effect. A typical example of f (x; ) is a Gaussian, such as f (x; ) =  x2 1 exp - 2 , 2 2 2 2 = 1- , 2 (38)

which corresponds to the use of nonperfect photodetectors whose efficiency  is less than unity. Substituting in Eq. (8) for the exact distribution p(x, ) the smeared distribution p(x, ; ) yields exponential phase moments k () that differ from k in a systematic error (bias) (s) k as follows:


k () = with

dx gk (x; ) p(x, ),

(40)



gk (x; ) =

-

dy Kk (y) [f (y-x; ) - (y-x)] .

(41)

Examples of the kernel gk (x; ) for the determination of the systematic error (s) k are plotted in Fig. 2 [with f (x; ) according to Eq. (38)]. From a comparison of gk (x; ) with Kk (x) (see Figs. 1 and 2) it is expected that the absolute values of k () are smaller than those of k in general. The systematic error is state-dependent as it can be seen from Eq. (40). To give an impression of its magnitude, let us restrict attention to the classical limit and consider a state whose phase-space probability distribution is radially sharply localized at r = r0 such that r0  . In this case it can be shown that, on assuming Gaussian smearing and using the results in Sec. 2, k ()  exp - k2 2 k , 2 2r0 (42)

which reveals that the exponential phase moments can be determined from the smeared data quite reliably as long as k  r0 /. 11

It is worth noting that under certain circumstances it is possible to compensate for the systematic error during the sampling process, introducing an appropriately modified kernel Kk (x; ). Let us again assume Gaussian smearing, which is typically observed in nonperfect detection, and apply Eq. (37) together with Eq. (38). In this case we may replace Eq. (26) with [18] a a ^ ^

and follow the lines given in Sec. 3 and Appendix A. It is easily seen that in ~ Eq. (27) p(x, ) and Kk (x), respectively, must be replaced with p(x, ; ) and ~ k (x; ), provided that Kk (x; ) exists. The kernel Kk (x; ) obviously compen~ ~ K sates for the losses associated with nonperfect detection and can be obtained (k) (k) (k) from Eq. (A 2) in Appendix A, if Cl is replaced with Cl () =  -(l+k/2) Cl . In ~ close analogy to Eq. (28) we then find that the modified kernel Kk (x; ) can be rewritten as where for even and odd k, respectively,  k/2 Kk (x; ) is given by Eqs. (A 16) and (A 15), if in the integrals zk is replaced with zk () = zk /. Finally, Eqs. (29) and (30), respectively, are replaced with K2m+1 (x; ) = (-1)m

~ Needless to say that the polynomial can again be omitted since both Kk (x; ) and Kk (x; ) are solutions of the problem and in practical measurements Kk (x; ) ~ is more suited for error reduction than Kk (x; ). The numerical calculation of Kk (x; ) can be performed in a way as outlined in Sec. 3 for Kk (x). Examples of Kk (x; ) for various values of k and  are shown in Fig. 3. It should be pointed out that the sum rules (A 13) and (A 14) used in the derivation only apply when |zk ()| < 1. Hence we observe that the condition  > 1/2 must be fulfilled in order to compensate for Gaussian data smearing, which is analogous to the density matrix reconstruction in the Fock basis [9]. It is worth noting that the condition  > 1/2 corresponds to the requirement that the width of the Gaussian (38) is smaller than the vacuum noise. From Fig. 3 we see that with increasing |x| the kernel Kk (x; ) for odd k rapidly approaches the classical limit (13) for perfect detection, whereas for even k it approaches the classical limit (14) up to an irrelevant -dependent constant. The results reveal that in classical optics it is impossible to compensate for the losses in nonperfect detection, because of the vanishing vacuum noise of a classical oscillator. As expected, substantial differences between Kk (x; ) and Kk (x) are observed in the region around x=0, and they increase with decreasing  (Fig. 3). The [compared with Kk (x)] stronger variation of Kk (x; ) implies that the use of Kk (x; ) for sampling of the exponential phase moments from the smeared quadraturecomponent distribution gives rise to a larger statistical error than the use of Kk (x) (for the statistical error, see Sec. 4.3). This is obviously the price paid for suppression of the systematic error. Based on the precision of the data available, the experimenter should therefore decide whether to use Kk (x; ) (which increases the statistical error) or Kk (x) (which decreases the statistical error but introduces a bias).

4.2

Phase discretization

In practice, p(x, ) can only be measured at N discrete phases l . When they are equidistantly distributed over a 2 interval, i.e., l = (2/N)l, where l = 0, 1, . . . N -1, then application of Eq. (8) yields the experimentally determined exponential phase moments 2 N -1 ikl k (N) = e N l=0

is used and it is assumed, for notational convenience, that N > k. Note that from physical arguments it is also reasonable to assume that the number of phases is larger than the index of the measured moment (otherwise the systematic error could dominate the result). From Eq. (52) we see that the error is influenced by all off-diagonal densitymatrix elements of the type of n+k±sN,n . The effect, which is also called "aliasing", has also been found in the reconstruction of the density matrix in the Fock basis from the data measured in balanced [19] and unbalanced [20] homodyning. For highly excited states (i.e., n,m 0 if n, m<n0 , with n0  1) the relevant Q(k) ^ m,n can be approximately calculated, using in Eq. (53) the classical kernel given in Eqs. (13) and (14): Qn+k+sN,n  (-1)N s/2

for even N. We see that the error of the measured exponential phase moment is expressed in terms of higher-order moments, and it decreases with increasing N. Note that the difference between the errors in Eqs. (55) and (56) reflects the fact that with regard to a  interval, the number of different phases is twice as large for odd N as for even N, which of course substantially reduces the systematic error in the first case. 14

4.3

Statistical error

When in an experiment n(l ) measurements are performed for each phase l , the exponential phase moments can be estimated as, on applying Eq. (8),
(est) k (N)

2 N -1 ikl 1 n(l ) Kk [xr (l )], e = N l=0 n(l ) r=1

(57)

where xr (l ) is the result of the rth individual measurement at the phase l . (est) Taking the average of all estimates k (N),
(est) k (N)

2 N -1 ikl 1 n(l ) e = Kk [xr (l )], N l=0 n(l ) r=1

Kk (xr (l )) =

(60)

The variances of the real and imaginary parts of k (N) can be obtained in a similar way. Taking into account that the individual measurements are independent of each other, we derive Var Re[k and Var Im[k where {Kk [xr (l )]}2 =

.

(63)

Equations (61) ­ (63) enable us to estimate the statistical error of the measured moments, substituting in Eqs. (61) and (62) for {Kk [xr (l )]}2 the corresponding estimates. From Eqs. (61) ­ (63) it is seen that the statistical error depends on the shape of the function Kk (x). In order to reduce the statistical error, the ambiguity in the determination of Kk (x) can be advantageously used to choose it such that it varies as slowly as possible. This is one of the reasons 15

for omitting the polynomial in Eq. (28). Moreover, the statistical error can be reduced when the number of events, n(l ), is appropriately varied with the phase l . From Eqs. (61) and (62) it is suggested to increase n(l ) for such phases for which {Kk [xr (l )]}2 , Eq. (63), becomes relatively large. This is typically the case when p(x, ) is essentially nonzero in an x interval around x = 0, in which Kk (x) strongly varies with x. Note that this result is in qualitative agreement with that of the maximum-likelihood method for estimating phase shifts [21].

5.1

Computer simulations of measurements
Exponential phase moments

To illustrate the method, we have performed computer simulations of measurements of the quadrature component distribution p(x, ), assuming the signal ^ field to be prepared in various states, such as a squeezed vacuum |0 s = S()|0 = 1 ^ exp{- 2 [(^ )2 -  a2 ]}|0 and a displaced Fock state |, n = D()|n =exp(^ - a ^ a   a)|n . We have restricted attention to perfect detection and assumed that the ^ measurements are performed at N =120 (equidistant) phases l within a 2 interval and n(l ) = 104 events are recorded at each phase. Examples of the sampled exponential phase moments k are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for a squeezed vacuum and a displaced Fock state, respectively. The error bars indicate the standard deviations obtained according to Eqs. (61) and (62). Compared to the statistical error, the systematic error due to phase discretization is (for the chosen number N of phases l ) negligible small. From Figs. 4 and 5 we see that [for the chosen numbers n(l ) of events] the exponential phase moments are obtained with sufficiently good accuracy, provided that k is small enough. We further see that the accuracy decreases with increasing k. (Note that for the chosen state parameters the imaginary parts must vanish for all k.) Clearly, the accuracy can be improved if the number of measurements is increased.

5.2

Phase distribution

The possibility of direct sampling of exponential phase moments k offers novel possibilities of experimental verification of fundamental number­phase uncertainty relations, as has been shown recently [15]. It is worth noting that the measurements can be performed with high precision since only low-order moments play a role. Here we address the problem of the determination of the whole phase distribution P (). Since the exponential phase moments are nothing but the Fourier components of the phase distribution [Eq. (5)], the sampled moments can be used to

16

reconstruct the phase distribution according to 1 P () = 2


e-ik k .
k=-

(64)

Moreover, since any physical quantum state can be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy by truncating it at some photon number nmax if nmax is suitably large, from Eq. (20) it follows that (for chosen accuracy) the number of moments k that effectively contribute to P () in Eq. (64) is finite, i.e., |k| = 1, 2, . . . , K, with K = nmax . Hence, P () can be obtained truncating the sum in Eq.(64) at (est) |k| = K and substituting for the k the measured moments k . The phase distributions that are reconstructed from the measured moments given in Figs. 4 and 5 for a squeezed vacuum and a displaced Fock state, respectively, are plotted (est) in Fig. 6, on assuming that nmax =20. The statistical error of k gives of course rise to an error of P (). Since the error in P () can be obtained easily from the law of error propagation [22] in a standard way, we renounce the calculation here. Finally, it should be pointed out that there are other methods, such as leastsquares inversion [23, 22] and maximum-entropy inversion [24], which can be used for reconstructing the phase distribution from the measured (i.e., inaccurate) exponential phase moments ­ methods that have been successfully applied in various fields of physics. Let us briefly comment on the application of the method of least-squares inversion. For this purpose we return to Eq. (5) and ask for P () that best fits the experimental data at M chosen phases m (m = 0, 1, . . . , M -1, with M  2K). An answer can be given applying the method of least-squares inversion [23, 22] to the set of 2K linear equations for M unknown P (m ) (m = 2m/M), Re k = Im k = 2 M -1 cos(km ) P (m), M m=0 2 M -1 sin(km ) P (m ) M m=0 (65) (66)

with |k|  K. From comparison with the exact phase distribution it can be seen (Fig. 6) that outside the regions in which the phase distribution is essentially nonzero artificial oscillations and even negative values of the reconstructed distribution may be found, because of the statistical error of the measured moments (cf. Figs. 4 and 5). The problem can be partially overcome introducing regularization techniques in the solution of Eqs. (65) and (66) (for details, see [23]), as it can be seen from Fig. 6. The figure also reveals that the artifacts are suppressed at the expense of a smearing of the overall distribution.

Summary and conclusions

We have presented a method for direct sampling of the exponential moments of the canonical phase of a single-mode radiation field from the data recorded in balanced homodyning. The sampling method enables us to determine the moments in real time, together with the statistical error. It is worth noting that the method renders it possible to closely relate the basic-theoretical concept of canonical phase to the experiment. The sampling functions relating the quadrature-component distribution to the exponential phase moments are well behaved. With increasing quadrature-component they rapidly approach their classical counterparts given either by step functions (for odd moments) or logarithmic functions (for even moments). In this way the concept provides us with a unified approach to the experimental determination of the canonical phase in both quantum and classical optics. In our approach to the construction of the kernel functions needed for direct sampling the exponential phase moments we have extended the proposal made in [18]. Hence the here used subtraction of the polynomial arbitrariness from the sampling functions can be considered as a significant improvement. In fact the omittion of the ambiguity from the kernels provided us with functions that can be universally used for any physical state and that are much more insensitive to errors. This point should be also considered if a similar approach to the derivation of the kernel corresponding to any other generic field operator is adopted. In order to study the accuracy of the method, we have discussed the influence of various experimental inaccuracies on the measured exponential phase moments. In particular, the finite number of local-oscillator phases results in an aliasing effect, whereas smearing of the quadrature-component causes a bias toward smaller absolute values of the moments. When the data smearing results from imperfect detection with efficiency larger 50% , then modified sampling functions can be introduced for compensating the losses. To illustrate the applicability of the method, we have performed computer simulations of measurements for two quantum states and and presented the measured exponential phase moments including the statistical error. Finally, we have used the moments for a reconstruction of the whole phase distribution. The re18

sults obtained are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.

Asymptotics of Kk (x)

In order to find the asymptotic behaviour of Kk (x) for large x, we change the variables in the integrals in Eqs. (29) and (30) according to tanh(r 2 /2) =  and obtain K2m+1 (x) = x and K2m (x) = where D

(C 4)

Let us first draw attention to K2m+1 (x) in Eq. (C 1). For  > 0 the function D (2m+1) () is finite, and from the asymptotic behaviour of (k) (r 2 ) for large r it follows that D (2m+1) (1) = 0. From the asymptotic behaviour of the confluent hypergeometric function, (a, c, -t)  (c) 1 , (c-a) ta 22 t  , (C 5)

it follows that (m + 2, 3 , - x2 )  0 if |x|   except for  = 0. Hence, for 2 |x|  1 we can approximate the integral in Eq. (C 1), replacing D (2m+1) () with its expansion for   1. Taking into account that ln 1+ 1- = 2 1 + O( 2 ) (C 6)

and recalling the expansion of (k) (z), Eqs. (32) and (33), we find that 
(k)

1+ ln 1-

2 k/2 = 1 - (k+1) + O( 2 ) . (k/2)

(C 7)

Thus, for   1 the function D (2m+1) (), Eq. (C 3), can be given by D (2m+1) () = (-1)m (m+1)! -1/2 1 + O( 2 ) ,  (m + 1/2)   1, (C 8)

so that Eq. (C 1) for x  1 can be written as, on changing the variables as  1/2 x = t, K2m+1 (x) = 2(-1)m (m+1)! x 3 dt 1 + O t4 /x4 (m+2, 2 , -t2 ) (m + 1/2) 0 2(-1)m (m+1)! (1) = I (0) - I (1) (x) + O(x-4 ) I (2) (0) - I (2) (x) (m + 1/2)

 0 3 dt (m + 2, 2 , -t2 ) =

(2m + 1) [(2m + 1)/2] 8(m + 1)!

(C 12)

and it can be shown that I (2) (0)=0. Further, from Eq. (C 5) it follows that I (1) (x) = O(x-2m+1 ) and I (2) (x) = O(x-2m+1 ). For x < 0 (|x|  1) the calculations are quite analogous, so that
1 K2m+1 (x) = 4 (-1)m (2m + 1) sign (x) [1 + O(x-2m-3 )] , |x|  1.

(C 13)

To find the asymptotic behaviour of K2m (x), we subdivide the interval of integration in Eq. (C 2) as K2m (x) = I(0, M/x2 ) + I(M/x2 , 0) + I(0 , 1), 23 (C 14)

where I(a, b) =

(C 15)

and 0  1 and M  1 such that M/x2 < 0 . This reflects the qualitatively different behaviour of the integrand in these intervals. In the integrals I(0, M/x2 ) and I(M/x2 , 0 ) the variable  is small, so that D (2m) () can be expanded as, on using Eqs. (C 6) and (C 7), D (2m) () = (2)-1 (-1)m m  -1 1 + O( 2 ) ,   1. (C 16)

We also expand (1 +)-m-1 and can rewrite I(0, M/x2 ) as (after changing the variables) I(0, M/x2 ) = C1 (M) + O M/x2 , where C1 (M) = (2)-1 (-1)m m

Substituting in Eq. (C 14) for I(0, M/x2 ), I(M/x2 , 0 ) and I(0 , 1) the expressions derived above, it can be shown that the logarithmic divergences of C4 (0 ) and C5 (0 ) cancel for 0  0 and those of C3 (M) and C1 (M) cancel for M  , and hence K2m (x) =  -1 (-1)m+1 m ln |x| + O M/x2

Note that for 0  0 and M   the constant C(0 , M) becomes independent on 0 and M [for a determination of this irrelevant constant the value of the integral (C 24) must be known].

Abstract A non-linear quantum state transformation is presented. The transformation, which operates on pairs of spin-1/2, can be used to distinguish optimally between two non-orthogonal states. Similar transformations applied locally on each component of an entangled pair of spin-1/2 can be used to transform a mixed nonlocal state into a quasi-pure maximally entangled singlet state. In both cases the transformation makes use of the basic building block of the quantum computer, namely the quantum-XOR gate.

Introduction
11 12 21 22 (11 )2 (12 )2 (21 )2 (22 )2

Consider the following transformation of a spin-1/2 density matrix: in = - out = (1)

The question is if this transformation corresponds to a physically feasible quantum state transformation. At first one may be tempted to say:"of course not! This transformation is nonlinear and does not preserve the trace". But it turns out that this transformation is indeed possible to realize in the lab, it is only a question of technological difficulties and therefore of time. This transformation, which involves the fundamental building component of a quantum computer, can be used to differentiate optimally between non-orthogonal spin-1/2 states. A similar transformation applied to entangled pairs of spin-1/2 can be used to transform a mixed nonlocal state into a quasi-pure maximally entangled singlet state. Before constructing such a state transformer (using unitary and other well accepted transformations), it should be stressed that the output out depends only on in , not on any decomposition of in into pure states. Therefore, this kind of non-linear transformation does not lead to the 1

'arbitrary fast signalling' problem [1, 2]. That the trace is not preserved does not give rise to any problems either, since it merely reflects that some spins are lost during the transformation. If desirable, one could simply renormalize out . In the next section it is shown how the transformation eq. (1) comes about. In Sec. 3, it will be shown how the non-linear transformation can be used to distinguish between two non-orthogonal states, provided two copies of the state are available. In Sec. 4 the Loss Induced Generalized (LIGe) quantum measurement is presented [6]. It is a special construction of Positive Operator Value Measure (POVM), and it is shown how this specific measurement can be applied in two different ways, when two copies of the state are provided. It turns out that the 3 different ways to distinguish between two non-orthogonal states which will be described here all leads to the same probability of successfully determining the input state. In Sec. 5 it is proven that the probability of successfully determining the state is indeed also the optimal solution to the state identification problem. A generalized non-linear transformation, operating on entangled pairs of spin-1/2, can be used to transform a mixed nonlocal state into a quasipure maximally entangled singlet state. This will be described in Sec. 6.

2

How it works

To realize the transformation, one needs at least two identical independent copies of the same state in , and it will be assumed that this is possible. The first step consists of considering the spins pairwise, in - in  in (2)

This is quite easy to do, since nothing needs to be done physically. It is however this crucial step which makes the final transformation nonlinear. The second step consists of a 'controlled not gate' interaction between each spin in a pair. This is physically the hard part of the whole transformation. A controlled not gate (or quantum-XOR) flips the second spin (target spin) if and only if the first (source spin) is 'spin-up'. It is a unitary transformation, UXOR , acting on pairs of spin-1/2: | | | | ++ +- -+ -- UXOR = - - - - | | | | +- ++ -+ --

(3)

or when written in matrix notation: x 0 0 1 1 2 (4)

0 1 is the first Pauli matrix and 1 is the 2 × 2 identity 1 1 0 matrix. Note that the XOR, is the basic building block for a quantum processor [3]. The third step is again easy: measure the spin component of the second particle along the z-direction and keep the pair only if the result is 'down'. Hence there is a probability of failure. Altogether (see Fig.1) this procedure transforms the state of the out source spin from in source  source , whereas the target spin is always in left in the spin-down state target  out = | - - | = P- . The whole target transformation can be written as where x = 1 1  P- UXOR in  in UXOR 1  P- = out  P- 1

Where out is the density matrix in eq. (1), where each matrix element has been squared by itself. Other similar transformations can be build by using other components, which means substituting the control-not gate with other unitary interactions, see Fig. 2.

3 Using the transformation for state identification
The non-linear transformation which has just been described can be used to transform non-orthogonal states into orthogonal states, provided two copies of the state are available. By nature, non-orthogonal quantum states can not be distinguished with certainty, and even if this transformation can turn non-orthogonal states into orthogonal states, this does not in any way conflict with quantum mechanics, since there is a certain probability that the transformation fails. A density matrix describing a spin-1/2 system can be represented on the Poincare sphere in terms of a polarization vector P = (x, y, z) (also known as Bloch vector) and the Pauli-matrices  = (x , y , z ) in the following way: 1 1  = (1 + P · ) 2 (6)

For two spin-1/2 states to be orthogonal their corresponding polarization vectors must point in opposite directions on the sphere, in other words two states | a and | b are orthogonal if their polarization vectors satisfy Pa = -Pb . in in Consider the two pure spin-1/2 states | 1 and | 2 with the polar-

3

in in ization vectors P1 and P2 expressed in the usual spherical coordinates

xin = sin i cos i i in yi = sin i sin i in zi = cos i

(7)

where i = 1, 2. When transforming these two states, which means taking two copies of the same state, performing the control-not gate interaction between them and the filtering measurement, the new state have the following polarization vectors Piout :1
1 xout = 2 sin2 i cos 2i i out yi = 1 sin2 i sin 2i 2 out zi = cos i

(8)

out out For the corresponding spin states | 1 and | 2 to be orthogonal the requirement is that their corresponding polarization vectors must out out be opposite, i.e. P1 = -P2 . This can be fulfilled by imposing the following relations between the angles;

cos 1 = - cos 2 = 2 = 1 +  cos 21 = - cos 22 and

sin 21 = - sin 22

  1 = 2 - 

  1 = 2 -

 2

in in Imposing these constrains imply that the initial states | 1 and | 2 had the following density matrices,

1 2 1 in = 2 2 in = 1

1 + cos sine-i sinei 1 - cos

in = | 1 in = | 2

in 1 | in 2 |

(9)

1 - cos i sine-i -i sinei 1 + cos

out out Whereas the transformed states | 1 and | 2 have as density matrices the input matrices with each matrix element squared by itself, as seen in eq. (1). The two initial states are not orthogonal, i.e. in in = 0 which means 1 2 that they can not be distinguished with certainty. The overlap between in in 2 the states, which can be obtained from in in in = | 1 | 2 | in , is 1 2 1 1 found to be

sin in in | 1 | 2 | =  2

(10)

1

Notice that the outgoing polarization vectors Piout are not normalized

The two outgoing states are orthogonal, i.e. out out = 0. This means 1 2 that they can now be identified with certainty by performing a standard out von Neumann measurement. If the state | 1 is obtained the initial

4

in out states was | 1 . Similarilly, if the state | 2 is found the initial in state was | 2 . In other words the transformation makes it possible to distinguish with certainty between states which were originally not distinguishable. However, the transformation is not always successful. There is, in fact, only a certain probability that it will succeed, which is given by the trace of the out , where i is either 1 or 2. It is important i to realize that when the transformation is successful, the initial state is completely identified. Whereas if the transformation fails, no knowledge about the initial state can be obtained. The total probability of successfully identifying the state is

PrT (success) =

1 Tr(out ) + Tr out 1 2 2
2

=1-

sin2  2

(11)

in in Notice that this is equal to 1 - | 1 | 2 | .

4 Another way to identify non-orthogonal states
There are other ways of distinguishing between two non-orthogonal states without making any errors. A well-known way is to use Positive Operator Value Measure (POVM), which are generalized quantum measurements. The Loss Induced Generalized (LIGe) quantum measurement is a special POVM [4, 5], which has even been performed experimentally [6]. In the case of LIGe the idea is that the two non-orthogonal spin-1/2 lie in a plane spanned by two orthogonal states | 1 and | 2 , i.e.   in | 1 = cos | 1 + sin | 2 2 2   in | 2 = cos | 1 - sin | 2 2 2 (12)

in in with the overlap | 1 | 2 | = cos. The procedure is to add one dimension | 0 orthogonal to | 1 and | 2 , and then perform a rotation around | u  | 1 - | 2 , with an angle cos  = tan  . After the 2 rotation the two states can be written as    out | 1 = 2 sin | 1 + cos | 0 (13) 2    out | 2 = 2 sin | 2 + cos | 0 2

Since the three states | 0 , | 1 and | 2 are orthogonal they can be separated deterministically with a standard measurement. in If the initial state was | 1 the result of a measurement will either be | 1 with the probability 2sin2  or | 0 with probability cos . Where 2 in as if the initial state was | 2 the result of a measurement will either be | 2 with the probability 2sin2  or | 0 with probability cos . 2 5

Therefore when the state obtained is either | 1 or | 2 , we can in in conclude that the initial state was | 1 and | 2 respectively. Whereas if the obtained state is | 0 the initial state could have been either of the two and in order not to introduce any errors these results are discarded. in in The probability of identifying the state is 1 - | 1 | 2 | In order to compare the results obtained using the LIGe with the results obtained when using the nonlinear transformation, one has to think about how the LIGe can be used when two copies of the initial state are available. It turns out that there are two possibilities: (1) perform two independent LIGe measurements, one on each copy of the state or in in (2) perform one single measurement on the product state | i  | i . In the first case the probability of successfully identifying the state is the probability of success in the first measurement plus the probability of failure in the first times success in the second, i.e. Pr2×LIGe (success) = Pr(success) + Pr(f ailure) × Pr(success) T
in in = 1 - | 1 | 2 | 2

(14)

In the second case there one single LIGe measurement is performed on in in the product state | i | i , the probability of successfully identifying the state is
in in Pr1×LIGe (success) = 1 - | 1 | 2 | T 2

(15)

in in since the overlap between the two product states | 1  | 1 and in in in in 2 | 2  | 2 is equal to | 1 | 2 | . Notice that the three methods for state identification which have been presented so far, all have the the same probability of success. In the next section it is proven that this is indeed also the optimal solution.

5 The optimal solution to the state identification problem
In general when one wishes to distinguish deterministically between two non-orthogonal states and no errors are accepted, one is forced to introduce inconclusive answers. This means that there are three possible outin in comes, namely; the state was | 1 , the state was | 2 or "don't know". A "don't know" means that that state was not successfully identified and the result is discarded in order not to introduce any errors. This kind of measurement is realized by what is called a Positive-Operator Value Measure (POVM) [7]. The optimal POVM which answers these question is constructed in in in in 1-| 1 1 | the following way; the two projection operators P¬| 1 = 1 in in in in 1 2 | projects onto states orthogonal to | 1 and P¬| 2 = 1 - | 2 6

in | 2 , respectively. The three positive-operators which are needed (one of each possible answer) are formed using these two projection operators, in in A| 1 = x 1 - | 2 1 in 2 |

in in in 1 1 | A| 2 = x 1 - | 1 in in A? = 1 - A| 1 - A| 2 1

(16)

where the coefficient x now is to be optimized. The first two operators have the same coefficient because the initial states are equi-probable. The requirement is now that the probability of an inconclusive answer should be as low as possible, and that all three operators must be positive. These requirements leads to the following value, x= 1 in in 1 + | 1 | 2 | (17)

in in and gives probability | 1 | 2 | of obtaining an inconclusive answer. Hence the probability of successfully determining the state is in in Pr(success) = 1 - | 1 | 2 |

(18)

Suppose now that two copies of the initial state is available, then the probability of successfully determining the state is
in in Pr(success) = 1 - | 1 | 2 | 2

(19)

in in since the two copies can be thought of as the state | 1  | 1 or the in in in in 2 state | 2  | 2 , and these two state have overlap | 1 | 2 | . This shows that the methods for state identification which have been presented in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4 are indeed optimal.

Purification of mixed states of spin-1/2

It is straightforward to generalize the nonlinear transformations described in Sec. 2, to apply them to mixed states of entangled pairs of spin-1/2. The transformations can then be used to construct a purification scheme. As previously, the idea is to have two physical systems in the same state in , where in now represents an entangled pair of spin-1/2, i.e. it is a 4 × 4 density matrix. For concreteness it is assumed that within each pair, one spin is carried by a particle flying towards the left, while the other one is carried by a particle flying towards the right. The generalization consists in performing independently similar operations as in (5) to the two spins on the left hand side (known as Alice) and to the two on the right hand side (known as Bob). The operation is nearly identical to the XOR defined in (4), with a sign change on Bob's side: UA = -iy 0 0 1 1 UB = 7 iy 0 0 1 1 (20)

The filtering is done, as in the single spin case, by selecting the spin "down" state of each of the spins in the target pair. This leads to the following transformation: 1 (1  P- )A (1  P- )B UA UB in  in U U (1  P- )B (1  P- )A 1 1 B A 1 = out  P--

(21)

and gives rise to the following outgoing density matrix shared between Alice and Bob
     



in

-



out

=

This transformation preserves the the singlet state  - . After the transformation Alice and Bob both perform a bilateral (i.e. on both sides) /2 rotation around the x-axis of their remaining spin. This rotation interchanges the  + and the + Bell states without affecting the other two Bell states. What they have hereby obtained is a quantum state purification scheme which purifies towards the singlet state,  - . A purification scheme works in the following way: suppose the initial state in had fidelity F in =  - |in |  - (23)

(11 )2 -(12 )2 (13 )2 -(14 )2  -(21 )2 (22 )2 -(23 )2 (24 )2   (31 )2 -(32 )2 (33 )2 -(34 )2   -(41 )2 (42 )2 -(43 )2 (44 )2


(22)

with respect to the singlet state. Taking two copies of in , performing out the transformation and afterwards the rotation, the fidelity Frot of the out new state out is bigger than F in , i.e. Frot > F in . When the fidelity rot is equal to 1 it means that the state is a pure state and therefore not entangled with the environment (or an eavesdropper) [8, 9]. Repeating the above operations, including the bilateral rotation, on 1 a state with fidelity F in > 2 selects a subensamble with larger fidelity F out > F in . For example, suppose the initial state state had fidelity F in = 0.51, after 10 iterations the fidelity is F (10) = 0.809 and after 15 iterations the fidelity is F (15) = 0.99997. It should be mentioned that, depending on the input fidelity, F in , the fidelity after the purification, F out , may actually decrease for the first few iterations, but it will increase afterwards. In order to have a higher efficiency (keep more pairs), Alice and Bob can also keep the source pair when the outcome of their measurement on the target pair gave them ++, in other words Alice and Bob can keep their source pair if they both find - or they both find + when measuring their target pair. This purification scheme is, up to a phase, identical to the one developed by Deutsch et al. [9]. The only difference being that in their 8

scheme the preserved state is the + state, whereas here the preserved state is the singlet state.

Concluding remarks

It has been shown that a non-linear quantum state transformation which operates on pairs of spin-1/2, can be used to distinguish deterministically between two non-orthogonal states, provided two copies of the initial states are available. The transformation, which involves only a unitary operation (here the quantum XOR was used) and a filtering process (a measurement), can actually transform non-orthogonal states into orthogonal states. These states can now be separated deterministically with a standard von Neuman measurement. This transformation does not conflict with the basic laws for quantum mechanics, which tells us that non-orthogonal states can not be distinguished with certainty, since it only has a certain probability of success, which then becomes the probability of successfully determining the state. The result obtained when applying the non-linear transformation to the state identification problem was compared with a specific POVM measurement known as the LIGe (Loss Induced Generalized) quantum measurement. When two copies of the initial state are provided the LIGe can be applied in two different ways: either two independent LIGe measurements (one on each copy) or a single measurement on the product state of the two copies. Both procedures lead to the same probability for successfully determining the initial state. The same probability was obtained when using the non-linear transformation. This is in fact the optimal solution to the state identification problem, when inconclusive results -- but no errors -- are accepted. Finally it was shown how similar transformations applied locally on each component of an entangled pair of spin-1/2 can be used to transform a mixed nonlocal state into a quasi-pure maximally entangled singlet state. It should be mentioned that it is not only possible to square each component of the density matrix as was seen in eq. (1), but it can be raised to any power n + 1. This is done by taking n + 1 copies of in , where n of the copies act as target spins. A generalized XOR is then applied, which flips the target spins if and only if the source spin is spinup. This is followed by a projection onto the spin-down of all the target spins. This operation results in a density matrix out of the source spin where each component has been raised to the power n + 1. It is also possible to extent the 'squaring' of the components of the density matrix to higher dimensions. Suppose the initial pure state has dimension n, i.e. |  = (1 , ..., n ). Making the tensor product of two identical states gives the new state, |   |  = (11 , 12 , ..., nn ) with 9

the elements 11 = (1 )2 , 12 = 1 2 , ..., nn = (n )2 . In order to select the squared elements, i.e. ii = (i )2 the product state is rotated so that 11 - 1n , 22 - 2n , ... , nn - nn . These are the elements of interest. The other elements can be rotated in an arbitrary way, as long as they are not transformed into jn for all j. A projection onto the spin-n component of the target state leaves the target spin in the spin-n state, where as the source spin is left in the state where each component has been squared by itself.

Abstract
We have constructed the coherent state of U(N, 1) , which is an extension of the Barut-Girardello (BG) coherent state of SU(1, 1), in our previous paper. However there is a restriction that the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator is natural number. In this paper we construct the coherent state in the analytic representation to overcome this restriction. Next we show that the measure of the BG coherent state is not the symplectic induced measure.

Introduction

Coherent state of the harmonic oscillator is defined as the eigenstate of the annihilation operator and has been utilized for revealation of many physical properties. Concurrently its definition has been extended [1]. As a straightforward extension of the definition, there exists the Barut-Girardello (BG) coherent state [2], which is defined as the eigenstate of the lowering operator in SU(1, 1). The remarkable property is that the range of the eigenvalue of the Casimir operator is K > 0, in spite of the representation of SU(1, 1) being defined for K  1/2. (From this fact, the BG coherent state may be the coherent state of some covering group of SU(1, 1).) According to some groups there are further extensions of the BG coherent state [3, 4, 5]. In our previous work [4], we have constructed the extended BG coherent state based on some representation of U(N, 1) and its measure. However its eigenvalue of the Casimir, K, is restricted to natural number because the Schwinger boson method [6] is used in the construction. Thus in this paper we construct the coherent state in the analytic representation to overcome this restriction. Although the BG coherent state is a straghtforward extension of that of the harmonic oscillator, the measure is given by the integral formula [7]. While, ordinary measures such as the harmonic oscillator or the Perelomov coherent state [8] are ones induced from the canonical symplectic 2-form on the infinite dimensional complex projective space (hereafter abbreviated as the symplectic induced measure). Thus we investigate whether the measure of the BG coherent state (hereafter abbreviated as the BG measure) is the symplectic induced measure or not. The contents of this paper are as follows. In Sec II we construct the extended BG coherent state in the analytic representation. In Sec III we show that the BG measure is not the symplectic induced measure. The last section is devoted to the discussion.

where 1K is the identity operator in the representation space. It is remarkable that (2.7) holds for K > 0. So far we have expressed the BG coherent state by means of the Dirac notation. Alternatively it is possible to express in the analytic representation. We adopt the bases as un  where (a)n  a · (a + 1) · · · (a + n - 1) , and the operators as K+ = z , K- = z d d d2 + 2K , K3 = z + K . 2 dz dz dz (2.10) (2.9) 1 z n (= |K, n ) , n!(2K)n (2.8)

The Measure of the BG Coherent State

In this section, first we show the form of the symplectic induced measure and then we compare it with the BG measure. We define the infinite dimensional complex projective space: CP (H)  H - {0}/C , (C  C - {0}) , H  l2 (C) . 6 (3.1)

CP (H) is an infinite dimensional symplectic manifold and its element is written as P (X)  X X  X
-1

X =

XX  , (X  H - {0}) . X X

(3.2)

Then the canonical symplectic 2-form on CP (H) is given by  (X)  Tr(P (X)dP (X)  dP (X)) . Next we define a map f : M  CP (H) (M = D(1, 1) or C) such that f (z) = |z z| ; X = |z . z|z (3.4) (3.3)

By means of the map, we pullback the symplectic 2-form on CP (H) to M: M (z) = Tr(f (z)df (z)  df(z)) , (3.5)

where d is the exterior derivative on M. Putting (3.4) into (3.5), we obtain the explicit form: M (z) = dz  dz 1 2 log z|z , z|z z  z (3.6)

and this is the symplectic induced measure in 2 dimension. Usually path integral measures are given by the symplectic induced measure. As an example, we consider the Perelomov coherent state in SU(1, 1):


|  eK+ |K, 0 = where

where the measure is dµ(,  ) = 2K - 1 d  d .  (1 - ||2)-2K+2

(3.11)

The symplectic induced measure by (3.7) is given by 1 2   d d log | , |    d  d = 2K . (1 - ||2)-2K+2


| = 1 - ||2

, (3.12)

This is quite the same with (3.11) if (3.12) is normalized. Now, turning to the the BG coherent state, the measure: dµ(z, z  )  2K2K-1 (2|z|) 2K-1  |z| dz dz , (2K) (3.13)

is obtained by the integral formula [7]:
 0

dx2x+ K2(-) 2x1/2 xs-1 = (2 + s)(2 + s) .

(3.14)

We investigate whether it is the symplectic induced measure or not. Let us calculate   dz  dz 1 2 log z|z , z|z z  z z|z = 0 F1 2K; |z|2 . (3.15)

Utilizing the polar coordinate z = rei , we write (3.15) as  = dz  dz By noting d 1 0 F1 (; t) = 0 F1 ( + 1; t) , dt  eq (3.17) becomes  = dz  dz + 1 1 2K {0 F1 (2K; r 2)}3

Eq (3.19) looks different from the BG measure. Now we compare the behavior of (3.19) with that of the BG measure near the origin. From the definition of the hypergeometric function (2.12), the behavior near the origin in O(z) is

(3.20)

Thus the behavior of  in O(r 2 ) is   dz  dz 2K + 3 1 1- r2 2K 2K(2K + 1) . (3.21)

On the other hand, from the definition of modified Bessel functions: K (z) =  I- (z) - I (z) , 2 sin  (z/2)2n z   I (z) = , 2 n=0 n!( + n + 1)

(3.22)

the behavior of the BG measure is 2K2K-1 (2|z|) 2K-1 1 1 r2 |z|  + +··· (2K) (2K) sin (2K - 1) (-2K + 2) (-2K + 3) r2 1 + +··· -r K-1/2 (2K) (2K + 1) 1 sin (2K - 1) sin (2K - 1) = - r2 + · · · sin (2K - 1) (2K - 1) (2K - 1)(2K - 2) 1 1 -r K-1/2 + r2 + · · · , (3.23) (2K)(2K) (2K)(2K + 1) where we have used the formula (z)(1 - z) =  , sin z (3.24)

in the second equality. For K > 1/2, (3.23) becomes (3.23) = 1 1 1- r2 + · · · . (2K - 1) 2K - 2 (3.25)

If  is assumed to be another measure of the BG coherent state, then the resolution of unity with the measure must hold. On the other hand, dµ is the measure of the BG coherent state and satisfies the resolution of unity (2.7). Then by the Lebesgue's theorem, 9

 must coincide with dµ. However, comparing (3.21) with (3.25) apart from the total normalization, the behaviors of them are different. Thus we conclude that  is not a measure of the BG coherent state, or in other words, that the measure of the BG coherent state dµ is not the symplectic induced measure.

IV

Discussion

We have constructed an extended BG coherent state for a representation of U(N, 1) by means of the analytic representation to overcome the restriction of K. We have shown that the BG measure is not the symplectic induced measure. This is conclusively different from the Perelomov coherent state, and may be the reason why calculation of the path integral becomes difficult in contrast with that of the Perelomov coherent state [9, 10, 11]. There are attempts to explain the meaning of the measure of the coherent state [12]. However all examples in it are the symplectic induced measures. The BG measure is the first example which is not the symplectic induced measure. In spite of our effort, however, the essential meaning of the BG measure is not still clear. It is very important to reveal it.

Appendix A Comparison the BG Coherent State to the Symplectic Measure in K = 1/4 and K = 3/4
In Sec III, we have shown that the BG measure is not the symplectic induced measure by comparing them near the origin. In this appendix, we compare them in the explicit form for K = 1/4 and K = 3/4 to convince that they are really different measures.

We put the explicit form of the modified Bessel function: K-1/2 (z) = into the BG measure (3.13) to obtain dµK=1/4 (z, z  ) = dz  dz 1 -2r e , r (A.2)  -z e , 2z (A.1)

where we have used the polar coordinate (z = rei ) except for dz  dz. On the other hand, the symplectic induced measure (3.19) for K = 1/4 is K=1/4 = dz  dz -2r 2 2

The register consists of N qubits (i.e. spin 1 degrees of freedom), the bath is described by Nb bosonic 2 modes. The register-bath coupling is chosen in such a way that the total number of excitations is conserved. The Hilbert space splits allowing the study of the dynamics separately in each sector. Assuming that the coupling with the bath is the same for all qubits, the excitation sectors have a further decomposition according the irreducible representations of the su(2) spin algebra. The stability against environment-generated noise of the information encoded in a quantum state of the register depends on its su(2) symmetry content. At zero temperature we find that states belonging to the vacuum symmetry sector have for long time vanishing fidelity, whereas each lowest spin vector is decoupled from the bath and therefore is decoherence free. Numerical results are shown in the one-excitation space in the case qubit-dependent bath-system coupling. 71.10.Ad , 05.30.Fk

I. INTRODUCTION

The unavoidable interaction that each real-world system has with its environment is one of the major limitations to pratical realization of a quantum computer [1]. Indeed the outstanding potential capabilities of such a device rely heavily on the possibility of maintaining the quantum coherence in the system, and one of the typical effects of the coupling with the environment is to destroy phase relations between quantum states appearing in a linear superposition. This latter phenomenon is referred to as decoherence [2]: it can take place also when there is no system-environment energy exchange at all. To overcome this difficulty, in the last few years there has been a growing interest in the so-called error correction schemes [3], in which, by means of suitable encondings and measurement protocols, one is able to disentangle the system from the environment in order to recover uncorrupted information. Another possible approach, pointed out in [4], is to make use of symmetry to protect the information stored in a quantum state against environment-induced noise. In this case one, rather than to design states that can be easily corrected, looks for states that cannot easily be disturbed. The simplest system for which dynamical symmetry provides us these "safe" states is a collection of N qubits coupled all in the same way with the environment. Such a system can be thought of as quantum register S, analogous to those characteristic of classical computation. In this paper we study a model Hamiltonian describing the exchange of elementary quanta between the register and the environment, modelled by a bosonic bath B. The coupling with the bath is realized in term of the off-diagonal generators of a su(2) dynamical algebra [5]. The marginal dynamics of S is dissipative (i.e. the register energy is not conserved). The global Hilbert space decomposes in (dynamically) invariant sec1

tors, characterized by their su(2) symmetry content as well as their number of excitations, as it will be specified later. It should be emphasized that the focus of this paper is on the role played by dynamical-algebraic structures in providing collective states of the register intrinsecally stable against environment-induced decoherence. The adopted physical model is, in a sense, generic and it is not aimed to describe a specific physical implementation of a Quantum Computer (as done instead, for example in [6]) but a broad class of open quantum systems that could eventually turn out to be relevant for quantum data processing applications. In sect. II, after recalling the fundamentals of open quantum systems, the model is introduced and its general feature briefly discussed. In sect. III the associated Hilbert space structure is analyzed. In sect. IV the oneexcitation subspace is studied, analytical as well as numerical results are presented for the fidelity and entropy. Sect. V contains some preliminary numerical results in the case of a qubit depending coupling with the bath. Section VI contains a number of conclusive remarks and perspectives

II. THE MODEL

Before introducing our model we begin by briefly recalling a few basic facts about open quantum systems. Let Hs , Hb denote respectively the system and the environment Hilbert spaces. We assume Hb to be much larger than Hs . The total Hilbert space is given by the tensor product H = Hs  Hb . A state over H ( = s, b) is a hermitean non negative operator  of End(H ) with tr ( ) = 1. The manifold of the state over H will be denoted by S . The elements of S that are also projecP tors (2 = ) provide the pure states. The set S of

pure states generates S as its convex hull, furthermore it is in a one-to-one correspondence with H . According to quantum mechanics, time evolution of the overall (closed) system is unitary, therefore if the initial state has the separable form (0) = s  b , (  S ) then for any t  0, the marginal (Liouvillian) evolution on Ss (open) is given by
 Et b : Ss  Ss : s  trb (Ut (0) Ut ),

where gki (t)  gki exp[i (k - i ) t]. By a formal integration of the field equation and the substitution of the result into the spin equations one obtains i i
+ i = + (t) - 2 i i t z i = -z (t) - i t t j 0 t j 0 + z d Kij (t,  )j ( ) i (t),

+ - d Kij (t,  )j ( )i (t) - h.c.

where trb denotes the partial trace over Hb . The superop erators {Et b }t0 are trace-preserving completely positive maps [7], that are the most general description of the evoP lution of an open quantum system. S is not invariant  under the action of {Et b }t0 , typically an initial pure state of the subsystem becomes mixed in a very short time scale depending on the strength of the interaction. This state can either eventually get pure again or not, but in any case an irreversible loss of the information stored in the initial preparation has occurred. It is important to notice that this mechanism is active even when there is no energy-exchange between the subsystems (i.e. the subystem Hamiltonians are constants of motion) at finite as well as at zero temperature. When an energy-exchange occurs we call the resulting dynamics dissipative. We introduce now the model. The Hamiltonian is given by H = Hs + Hb + HI where

This coupled system of non-linear integro-differential equations describes the dynamics of the spin subsystem in closed form. By means of the intermediation of the bath bosons each spin gets interacting with all the others it via a sort of time-retarded Heisenberg coupling. The information about the bath (dynamics as well as preparation) is contained in the kernels Kij , and in the operators { }. If j = , (j = 1, . . . , N ) and the bathi spin coupling is the same for all the spins, one has Kij (t, t ) =

 here the i 's are the spin 1/2 Pauli operators (i is the qubit index), and the bk 's bosonic operators. Hs (Hb ) is the Hamiltonian of the register (bath), HI the registerbath interaction. This model is closely related to the one known in the literature as the Dicke maser model [8]. The latter, for generic N, Nb , is not solvable and has a non-trivial ground-state phase diagram. In order to shed some light on the physics of this system we write down the equation of the motion for the Heisenberg operators O(t)  U (t) O U (t). To simplify the expressions, it turns useful to perform the (unitary) transformation ± ± j  j exp(± ii t), bk  bk exp(-i k t), whereby the Heisenberg equations then read

Under rather general assumptions this kernel is strongly peaked at t = t , If one has Kij (t, t )  (t - t ) then (6) become a system of coupled non-linear differential equations. Despite this strong simplification, also in this case the solution, due to non-linearity, remains difficult and one has to resort to numerical techniques. An alternative approach based on symmetry considerations, will be introduced in the next section.

The Hilbert space is given by the tensor product H =   Hs N  Hb Nb , being Hs (Hb ) the two (infinite) dimensional single spin (boson) space. The coupling of the spin system with the bosonic bath is described by the hamiltonian HI is such that the raising (lowering) of one spin state is associated to the destruction (creation) of one boson. From this follows that the system admits the constant of motion

The latter is a lowest weight vector for the spin as well as for the boson algebra: -  |0 = bk |0 = 0, , k. Its energy is set equal to zero. The Hilbert space splits into invariant eigenspaces of I, H = I HI ; an elementary combinatorial argument shows that the dimension of the I-excitations space HI , (I  N) is given by

If N = Nb = 1, one has d0 = 1, dI = 2, (I  1), the model reduces to the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings model of quantum optics [9]. It is worth noticing that the general spin-boson model considered in the literature on quantum dissipation, [usually addressed in the framework of the Feynmann-Vernon influence functional (see [10] for a review)], due to the presence of terms - + bk i , b i , (neglected here in view of the rotating wave k approximation) does not conserve I, spoiling the associated dynamical decomposition of the Hilbert space, on which our subsequent numerical analysis relies. Nevertheless, since in this papers we are interested only in the role played by collective effects in stabilizing a quantum state, this restrictions does not result in any severe loss of generality. (n) A basis for HI is given by |,k = |  |k , where
n I-n + j |0 s ,

 being S  = j=1 Sj , ( = z, ±) global spin operators, spanning a Lie Algebra su(2), and B = k gk bk . The fact that in (10) the spins appear only trough the S  's means the all the qubits are treated symmetrically: the dynamics allows only for coherent excitations of the computational (spin) degrees of freedom. This is, from the algebraic point of view, a very strong constraint: the dynamics gets invariant under the action of the symmetryc group SN of the qubit index permutations. This provides us one more constant of motion. Indeed from (10) immediately follows that the total spin S 2 is conserved and HI splits according the su(2)-irrep. The multiplicity of each irrep associated with the total spin quantum number S is given by

Following the general scheme of [4] we specialize hereafter the model assuming the parameters {i }, {gki }, (i = 1, . . . , N ), independent of the qubit replica index i. The first assumptions follows simply from the fact that qubits are replicas of the same system. The independence of the coupling constants on the qubit index is analogous to the so-called Dicke limit of quantum optics [8]; it holds - for example - when the typical bath wave-lengths coupled with the register are much greater than the distances between the qubits. In this latter case the environment is no able to probe the internal structure of the register: as long as the dynamics is concerned it has an effective point-like topology. The common value  of the qubit "magnetic" fields {i } will be chosen as the unit of the energy scale; analogously the "sound velocity" of the boson will be set equal to one, so that their dispersion relation reads k = k, (k = 2  n/Nb , n = 1, . . . , Nb ). The Hamiltonian can then be written as H =  S z + B S + + S - B  + Hb , (10) 3

sym The orthogonal complement of HI will be denoted A by HI . It is the direct sum of all the sectors with non-maximal S 2 -eigenvalue. Before ending this section we notice that an additional term of the form H  = S z k wk (bk + b ), would destroy the u(1) symmetry k generated by I, but not the su(2) structure. Such a term, considered in [4], does not correspond to an energyexchange but is a source of pure decoherence. Since our analysis relies on the invariant decomposition H = I HI this term has been omitted here.

sym On the other hand the spectrum in H1 is given by the Nb + 1 zeros of the expression [11] Nb

Due to the field-theoretic nature of our model, the dimensionality formula (8) clearly shows that for increasing excitation number I the problem of diagonalizing H becomes rapidly intractable. In particular, a finitetemperature analysis (arbitrary number of excitations) is very difficult. Nevertheless one of the interesting features of quantum noise is to be active also a T = 0, thanks to vacuum fluctuations. This latter issue can be addressed by exact numerical means, without an artificious truncation of the bosonic space, by noticing that the one-excitation space H(1) , has dimension d1 = N + Nb , that is only a linear function of the total number of de(1) grees of freedom. The basis {|,k } is given by |

Now we observe that the vectors {|k }, are annihilated by S - , as they have minimal S z -projection, but also by the {bk }, as they have empty boson sector. From this follows A that HI |k = 0, (k) therefore H1 is decoupled from the bath; it is an energy eigenspace with eigenvalue E = .

The states over H1 are unaffected by the decoherence induced by coupling with the bath vacuum and can therefore to encode inA formation in a safe way. The space H1 is noiseless only at zero temperature; for finite temperature the |k 's get mixed with all the vectors belonging to the same su(2)irrep, making the induced dynamics non unitary. It is important to notice that, for N = 2, this states are not the noiseless ones introduced in [4], as the latter are associated with spin singlets (i.e. are annihilated by S - and S + ) and are decoherence-free at any temperature, whereas the |k 's belong to N - 1-dimensional su(2) multiplets. The spectrum in the symmetric subspace can be obtained by resorting to exact numerical diagonalization of H, that provides the eigenvectors and eigenvalues {|i , Ei }d1 . i=1

The first (last) N (Nb ) terms describe a sector with a reversed (excited) spin (boson). The marginal density matrix can be readily diagonalized, simply by observing that it can be written in the form s (t) = P1 (t) |s (t) s (t)|+ P0 (t)|0 s 0|s , where |s (t) = 1

A completely symmetric expression (  k, P1  P0 ) is obtained for the bath marginal density matrix b = trs (), from which follows that Sb = Ss , furthermore we have S(S|B) = S(B|S) = -Ss for the conditional entropies, and S(B : S) = -2 Ss for the mutual entropy; this is a consequence of the purity of the overall system-bath state. In order to study the corruption of the information stored in a pure quantum state it appears useful to study the following quantity, called (input-output) fidelity [12]

In analogy with the latter, for long time scale, t > tC , it exhibits a complex pattern of collapses and revivals [13]. Furhermore since in each excitation space we have only a finite number of degrees of freeedom the phenomenon of the Poincar´ recurrences is also present for t > tR . e In the following we will show results for t  tC , tR , in other terms we assume that, thanks to the great number of bosonic modes and the weak coupling, the physically relevant time-scales are much smaller than the ones at which this more complex behaviour appear. The energy exchange of the register with the bath can then be considered irreversible.

The "decoherence" function D(t) is related to the decay of the off-diagonal elements of s (t); indeed if, at t = 0, we prepare the system in the state 2-1/2 (|0 s + s s s |0 )  |0 b , where S z |0 = (1 - N/2) |0 , it is immes -1 diate to check that 0 |s (t)|0 s = 2 D(t). The mechanism responsible for the energy exchange induces also a dephasing between the zero and one excited spin states: dissipation is associated with decoherence. In figure (1) is shown the behaviour of F (t), for different values of the coupling with the bath, with initial data s |0 = | sym . In this figure and in the subsequent ones -1  is chosen as the time unit. These results are obtained by exact diagonalization of H in H1 , that provides the dynamical functions {C (t)}. For strong bath-system couplings F (t) develops oscillatory structures, due to the back and forth exchange of energy between the system and the bath. We report the simulations for weak couplings, since it is the case physically relevant. Furthermore, since we are essentialy interested in the role played in the large times dynamics, by the symmetry structure of the initial state, and not in a detailed description of the bath-system coupling, we have choosen gk = g0 , (k). From the point of view of the energy-information loss the latter choice is the worst case in that each qubit is coupled equally well with all the bath modes, which should not, of course, be the case in real systems. The fidelity in this range of coupling parameters and for intermediate times, vanishes in exponential way F (t)  exp(-t/ ). The relaxation time , which turns out to be inversely proportional to N k |gk |2 , is the time scale over which the dissipative process takes place. The real and immaginary parts of D(t) have an exponential damping modulated by oscillations over a time scale -1 . For very small times a naive perturbation up to the second order in HI shows that indeed F (t)  1-t2 /2 N , where  = k |gk |2 .

In other terms: the final state depends on the initial preparation symmetry content; a complete corruption of the initial information is obtained only if the initial state belongs to the vacuum S 2 -sector H1 (N/2), so that the smaller is the projection over it, the closer to one is the fidelity. s A The extreme case is |0  H1 , F (t) = 1, t in which there is no relaxation at all. In the intermediate situations the spin system remains partially entangled with the environment and its state never gets pure. This situation is illustrated in figures (2), and (3) where fidelity and entropy are shown as functions of time in the case of s |0 = M -1/2 M | , for M = 1, 2, 3. In this case it =1 is trivial to check, by using equations (26), and (27), that F  (1 - M/N )2 , and Ss  (M/N - 1) log2 (1 - M/N ) - M/N log2 (M/N ).

The system undergoes energy as well as information loss. On the other hand if |ca |2 = 1, the final, and initial, state |a is maximally entangled: energy and information are conserved.

In the temporal range in which the decay of fidelity is exponential, the following relation between relaxation times holds:  (cs ) |cs |2 =  (1). 6

In this section we present some numerical results in the case in which the system-bath coupling depends on the qubit replica. If the coupling functions {gk (i)} and/or the qubit energies {i } depend on the qubit replica, the total spin operator S 2 is no longer a constant of the motion. This situation is expected to be more realistic than the one previously assumed in that the latter amounts to have a bath with an infinite (i.e. very large) coherence length. In this case the decomposition (13) is not invariant: the dynamics results in a non-trivial mixing of the su(2)-irreducible sectors HI (S, r). In particular one has A S - H1 = 0, therefore the vectors | a can decay. In other words the loss of the symmetry constraint allows the dissipation-decoherence induced by the bath to invade the whole Hilbert space. We choose gk (i) = g0 cos(k i/), where  is a parameter related to the bath coherence length (so that for  =  we recover the results of the previous sections). In figure (4) are reported the plots of A F (t) with initial condition in H1 for different 's.

replicas of a two-level system (i.e. a N -qubits register). The register environment is described by a bosonic bath consisting of Nb modes, with Nb  N. Its coupling with the register is realized by the exchange of elementary quanta of energy. The resulting dynamics of the register is dissipative; in the weak coupling regime, energy and information are irreversibly lost into the bath. Even though the model is non-trivial, exact analytical as well as numerical results can be obtained thanks to the existence of a constant of the motion (excitation number) that leads to a decomposition of the total Hilbert space in dynamically independent sectors. Assuming that the environment couples in the same way with all the register qubits one has a further splitting of the sectors according to the irreducible representations of the spin su(2) algebra. Each su(2) lowest vector is decoupled from the bath vacuum fluctuations and therefore, at zero temperature, is decoherence free. The smallest subspace in which one can have non-trivial physics is the one-excitation sector H1 . The dimension of H1 scales linearly in the total number of degrees of freedom, therefore a thorough analysis of the dynamics in H1 , can be performed by means of exact numerical diagonalization of the model Hamiltonian. The temporal dependence of quantity of interest, such as fidelity and entropy have been studied. The asymptotic behaviour depends on the symmetry content of the initial state. Smaller is the projection of the initial state over the vacuum su(2)-sector Hsym , greater is the fidelity. In particular a complete energy-information loss occurs only when the state belongs to Hsym . Some numerical results for bath-system coupling dependent on the qubit are also presented. In this more realistic situation the su(2)-structure is unstable: dissipation and decoherence affects the whole Hilbert space and then safe encondings no longer exists. Nevertheless our results shows that, on long time scales, the average fidelity of the previously noiseless states is still greater of the one of the other states. This suggest that the symmetry-based protection of quantum state suggested in [4] can be valuable in the general case. This last issue, along with the necessary finite temperature generalizations, worth further investigations.

Abstract
It is shown that a topological vector-potential (Berry phase) is induced by the act of measuring angular momentum in a direction defined by a reference particle. This vector potential appears as a consequence of the back-reaction due to the quantum measurement.

Observables in an isolated system need to commute with any conserved quantity of the system. They need therefore to be defined, in classical mechanics as well as in quantum mechanics, as relative observables [1, 2]. Consider for example a measurement of the angular momentum, LA , of particle A. Since LA generally does not commute with the conserved total angular momentum, LT otal = LA + LB + · · ·, it can not be observed. In practice however, we always specify an axis nB , where B refers to another element of the ^ system, with respect to which nB · LA is measured. The relative angular momentum, ^ nB · LA , indeed commutes with LT otal . We notice that a measurement of nB · LA , obviously ^ ^ requires interacting with both the system and the reference system and thus affects both. It is here that the quantum mechanical case differs considerably from the classical case. The uncertainty principle implies that unlike classical mechanics, the quantum mechanical backreaction must always be sufficiently large. In the example eluded above, the measurement rotates the angular momentum components, which do not commute with nB · LA , by an ^ uncertain large angle. In this letter we show that, the "strong" nature of the quantum mechanical backreaction on the reference system, can in particular cases give rise to an effective topological vector-potential. This induced topological effect can be interpreted as a Berry phase, thus leading to a fundamental relation between quantum measurements and the Berry effect. To begin with, let us consider a measurement of a half-integer spin s. The role of the reference system is to provide us with a direction n = r/|r|, with respect to which that ^ observable sn = n · s is measured. Choosing the reference system to be described by a free ^ ^ particle, the measurement of sn can be described by the von-Neumann-like interaction, and ^ the total Hamiltonian is: H= P + Hs + g(t)q^ · s. n 2M (1)

Here Hs stands for the Hamiltonian of the spin system. The measurement is described 1

by the last term: q is the conjugate to the "output register", Pq , and g(t) is a time dependent coupling constant, which we shall take to satisfy g(t)dt = g0 . In the impulsive

limit, g(t)  g0 (t - t0 ), the above interaction corresponds to the ordinary von-Neumann measurement. Notice that in the limit of a continuous measurement, for which g(t) = constant in a finite time interval, the von-Neumann interaction term in Eq. (1), has the same form as the well known monopole-like example of a Berry phase [3]. Thus a Berry phase is expected upon rotation of the reference system. But while in Berry's case the interaction is put in "by hand" just to study its consequences, in our case the interaction naturally arises whenever the spin is measured. As we shall see, the appearance of the Berry phase and the associated vector potential, can be easily obtained by transforming to a quantum reference-frame. There the spin observable becomes directly measurable and the back-reaction felt by the reference particle is precisely given by the requisite Berry vector potential. Let us consider first the 2-dimensional case. The reference axis is given in terms of the unit vector n = x cos  + y sin , and n · s = sx cos  + sy sin . The last term in ^ ^ ^ ^ the Hamiltonian (1) above, can be simplified by transforming to a new set of canonical coordinates. The the unitary transformation: U(2d) = e-i(sz - 2 ) . yields the relations: p = U  p U = p - (sz - 1/2) ; pr = pr ; r  = r, sx = sx cos  + sy sin  ; sy = sy cos  - sx sin  ; sz = sz . (3) (4)
1

(2)

The extra 1/2 factor in (2) is required in order to preserve the single valueness of the wave function, of the combined spin and reference particle system, with respect to the angular 2

coordinate . (For an integer spin we drop the 1/2). Expressing the Hamiltonian in terms of the new coordinates we obtain: H= s - 1/2 ^ 1 p+ z  2M r
2  + Hs + g(t)qsx .

(5)

In the rotated coordinate system, the measuring device interacts directly with sx . Conservation of the total angular momentum, p - 1/2, is guaranteed since [sx , p ] = 0. We notice however that in the new coordinate system the reference particle sees the effective vector potential A(2d) = sz - 1/2 ^ . r (6)

The latter describes the back-reaction on the reference frame, which here takes the form of a fictitious magnetic fluxon at the origin r = 0, with a magnetic flux  = sz - 1/2 in the z -direction. In the absence of the measurement, (g(t) = 0), the sz component ^ of the spin is a constant of motion. Thus, the 2s + 1 components of the wave function in the sz representation evolve independently. The vector potential corresponding to the ^ sz = ms component is A(2d) = (ms - 1/2)/r, i.e. it corresponds to an integer number of quantized fluxons. Since for all the components the vector potential is equivalent to a pure gauge transformation, and causes no observable effect on the reference particle. On the other hand, during the measurement, the interaction with the measuring device causes a rotation of sz . In particular, consider the limit of large g0 and M. In this case we can regard the rapid motion of the spin as following adiabatically the slow motion of the reference particle. The effective vector potential seen by the reference system can therefore be obtained by taking the expectation value of A(2d) with respect to the spin wave function: A(2d) = 1/2 ^ sz - 1/2 ^   . r r (7)

This corresponds to a semi-quantized fluxon at the origin r = 0, pointing to the z direction. ^ The total phase accumulated in a cyclic motion of the reference particle around the semi3

fluxon yields the topological (path independent) phase: n = where n is the winding number. In the more general case, of a free reference particle in 3-dimensions, the appropriate
 transformation which maps: sx = U(3d) sx U(3d) = n · s is ^

A(2d )dl = n,

(8)

U(3d) = e-i(-/2)sy e-i(sz -1/2) , where  and  are spherical angles. [4] The corresponding 3-dimensional vector-potential is in this case A(3d)x = -sy A(3d)y cos  cos  + sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 r cos  sin  - sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 = -sy r sin  A(3d)z = sy . r sin  , r sin  cos  , r sin 

(9)

(10) (11) (12)

For the case of an integer spin or angular momentum the 1/2 above is omitted. It can be verified that A(3d) corresponds to a pure gauge non-Abelian vector potential. The field strength vanishes locally, Fµ = µ A - Aµ -[Aµ , A ] = 0. Thus the force on the reference particle vanishes. Furthermore since the loop integral, A(3d ) · dr, gives rise to a trivial flux 2n, the manifold is simply connected. (This can be seen by noticing that the magnetic field,  × A(3d) , due to the terms proportional to sy vanishes. The other terms correspond to a fluxon pointing in the z -direction with total flux  = sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 which is ^ quantized for spin components along the direction /2 - .) Thus, as in the 2-d case, in absence of coupling with the measuring device, A(3d) is a pure gauge vector potential. In the adiabatic limit discussed above, during the measurement we have sz  sy  0. The effective vector potential seen by the reference particle A(3d) = sx cos  - 1/2 4 ^  , r sin  (13)

is identical to the (asymptotical, r  ) non-Abelian 't Hooft - Polyakov monopole [5] in the unitary gauge. The effective magnetic field,  × A(3d) : B = sx r r3 (14)

corresponds to that of a magnetic monopole at the origin, r = 0, with a magnetic charge m = sx . The topological vector potential obtained above, clearly have an observable manifestation. Upon rotation of the reference particle around the z axis, the particle accumulates ^ an Aharonov-Bohm phase: n = A(3d) · dr = -n(1 - cos ), (15)

which equals half of the solid angle subtended by the path. The latter can be observable by means of a standard interference experiment. We thus conclude that during a continuous measurement the back-reaction on the reference particle takes the form of a topological vector potential, of a semi-fluxon in 2-dimensions and that of a monopole in 3-dimensions. Our discussion above can also be restated in terms of Berry phases. Viewing the reference particle as a slowly changing environment, and the spin system as a fast system which is driven by a time dependent `environment', we can use the Born-Oppenheimer procedure to solve for the spin's eigenstates. Let us assume for simplicity that g0 is sufficiently large so Hs can be neglected, and that g(t) is roughly constant. Considering for simplicity the 2-dimensional case, the appropriate eigenstate equation therefore reads gq^ () · s|() = E|() , n (16)

where  is here viewed as the external parameter. For simplicity let us consider the case of s = 1/2. We obtain: 1 |± () =  e-i/2 | z ± e+i/2 | z 2 5  |q . (17)

The eigenfunctions |± are double-valued in the angle . Thus a cyclic motion in space, which changes  by 2, induces a sign change. The latter is due to the `spinorial nature' of fermionic particles, which as is well known, flips sign under a 2 rotation [6]. To obtain the appropriate Berry phase we need to construct single valued solutions of Eq. (17): |() = e-i(sz +1/2) | x = e-i | z ± | z It then follows that the Berry phase [3]: Berry = i ()|  |() d = n , r (19)  |q . (18)

is identical to the phase, (8), which is induced by the effective semi-fluxon. Similarly, the Berry phase in the 3-dimensional case corresponds to half of the solid angle subtended by the path of the reference particle. In conclusion, we have shown that the quantum mechanical back-reaction during a measurement induces in certain cases a topological vector potential. The Berry phase can be viewed in this framework, as a necessary consequence of the "strong" nature of the quantum back-reaction.

Abstract
It is shown that a topological vector-potential (Berry phase) is induced by the act of measuring angular momentum in a direction defined by a reference particle. This vector potential appears as a consequence of the back-reaction due to the quantum measurement.

As is well-known, many of the most common observables (position, velocity, angular momentum, etc..), both in classical mechanics as well as in quantum mechanics, are relative observables ­ they always are defined relative to a system of reference [1, 2]. Indeed, we never measure the absolute position of a particle, but the distance in between the particle and some other object; similarly, we never measure the angular momentum of a particle along an absolute axis, but along a direction defined by some other physical objects. Anything can constitute a "reference system", from macroscopic bodies to microscopic particles, but they are always there, even if, for simplicity, we don't always refer to them explicitly. Obviously, measuring a system relative to a frame of reference implies an interaction in between the system and the reference system (via the measuring apparatus), and thus affects both. It is here that the quantum mechanical case differs considerably from the classical case. The uncertainty principle implies that unlike classical mechanics, the quantum mechanical back-reaction can never be negligible. In this letter we show that, the "strong" nature of the quantum mechanical backreaction on the reference system, can in particular cases give rise to an effective topological vector-potential. This induced topological effect can be interpreted as a Berry phase, thus leading to a fundamental relation between quantum measurements and the Berry effect. To begin with, let us consider a measurement of a half-integer spin s in the direction defined by a quantum particle of mass M. In other words, we consider the measurement of the observable sn = n · s where s is the spin and n = r/|r| is the direction of the reference ^ ^ ^ particle as seen in the laboratory frame of reference. Choosing the reference particle to be free (except for the coupling with the spin during the measurement), and the measuring interaction to be von-Neumann-like, the total Hamiltonian is: H= P2 + Hs + g(t)q^ · s. n 2M (1)

Here Hs stands for the Hamiltonian of the spin system. The measurement is described by 1

the last term: q is a canonical variable of the measuring device and its conjugate, Pq , plays the role of the "pointer"; g(t) is a time dependent coupling constant, which we shall take to satisfy g(t)dt = 1. For the special case of a constant coupling, g(t) = 1/T for 0 < t < T

and zero otherwise, the shift of the position of the pointer yields the average relative spin: Pq (T ) - Pq (0) =
1 T T 0

n · sdt. In the limiting case of T  0, we obtain g(t)  (t), which ^

corresponds to the ordinary von-Neumann measurement. Notice that in the limit of a continuous measurement, for which g(t) = constant in a finite time interval, the von-Neumann interaction term in Eq. (1), has the same form as the well known monopole-like example of a Berry phase [3]. Thus a Berry phase is expected upon rotation of the reference system. But while in Berry's case the interaction is put in "by hand" just to study its consequences, in our case the interaction naturally arises whenever the spin is measured. As we shall see, the appearance of the Berry phase and the associated vector potential, can be easily obtained by transforming to a quantum reference-frame. There the spin observable becomes directly measurable and the back-reaction felt by the reference particle is precisely given by the requisite Berry vector potential. Let us consider first the 2-dimensional case. The reference axis is given in terms of the unit vector n = x cos  + y sin , and n · s = sx cos  + sy sin . (Here x and y and  denote ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the standard coordinate unit vectors and respectively the polar angle in the laboratory frame of reference.) The last term in the Hamiltonian (1) above, can be simplified by transforming to a new set of variables. The unitary transformation: U(2d) = e-i(sz - 2 ) yields the relations: p = U  p U = p - (sz - 1/2) ; pr = pr ; r  = r, 2 (3)
1

(2)

sx = sx cos  + sy sin  ; sy = sy cos  - sx sin  ; sz = sz .

(4)

The effect of this unitary transformation is to define new spin variables and a new canonical momentum for the reference particle, while the coordinates of the reference particle (defined with respect to the laboratory) remain unchanged. The extra 1/2 factor in (2) is required in order to preserve the single valueness of the wave function, of the combined spin and reference particle system, with respect to the angular coordinate . (For an integer spin we drop the 1/2). Expressing the Hamiltonian in terms of the new variables we obtain: H= 1 s - 1/2 ^ p+ z  2M r
2  + Hs + g(t)qsx .

(5)

In these variables, the measuring device interacts directly with sx . The relative spin sx is a measurable observable, which commutes with the total angular momentum, p - 1/2, since [sx , p ] = 0. We notice however that in the new variables the reference particle sees the effective vector potential A(2d) = sz - 1/2 ^ . r (6)

The latter describes the back-reaction on the reference frame, which here takes the form of a fictitious magnetic fluxon at the origin r = 0, with a magnetic flux  = sz - 1/2 in the z -direction. In the absence of the measurement, (g(t) = 0), the sz component of the ^ spin is a constant of motion. Thus, the 2s + 1 components of the wave function in the sz representation evolve independently. The vector potential corresponding to the sz = ms ^ component is A(2d) = (ms - 1/2)/r, i.e. it corresponds to an integer number of quantized fluxons. Since for all the components the vector potential is equivalent to a pure gauge transformation, it causes no observable effect on the reference particle. On the other hand, during the measurement, the interaction with the measuring device causes a rotation of sz , which in turn leads to observable effects. The rotation of sz and the exact character of 3

the associated effects depends on the relative strength of the different terms in (5). In the present work we are interested in the limit of "ideal", (i.e. very accurate) measurements. In this limit the interaction hamiltonian dominates all other terms. Indeed, in order for the measurement to be accurate, the initial position of the pointer, Pq (0) must be precisely known, i.e. Pq (0)  0. In turn, this implies that the uncertainty in q is very big, q  1/Pq (0)  , that is, the typical values of q in the interaction hamiltonian are infinite. As a consequence, in this limiting case the spin components sy and sz , which are orthogonal to n, rotate with infinite frequency, and can be averaged to zero. (In the ^ original variables (1) the spin is a "fast" degree of freedom which follows adiabatically the slow motion of the reference particle.) More exactly, the typical frequency of rotation of the spin components sy and sz , associated with the interaction hamiltonian is s  g/Pq = 1/(T Pq ). This is to be
 compared with the frequency associated with HS , the "free" hamiltonian of the spin, and

with the frequency associated to the kinetic term. The later one is the more important as it scales at least as 1/T ; indeed, to see the Berry phase one needs to perform an interference experiment with the reference particle during the time of the measurement, i.e. the duration of the interference experiment Texp  T . When the ratio of the angular frequencies is s /r  Texp /(T Pq ) >> 1 (which is always reached when the precision of the measurement is increased while keeping all other parameters constant) we are in the adiabatic regime. In the adiabatic regime corresponding to an ideal measurement the effective vector potential seen by the reference system can therefore be obtained by taking the expectation value of A(2d) with respect to the spin wave function: A(2d) = sz - 1/2 ^ 1/2 ^   . r r (7)

This corresponds to a semi-quantized fluxon at the origin r = 0, pointing to the z direction. ^ 4

The total phase accumulated in a cyclic motion of the reference particle around the semifluxon yields the topological (path independent) phase: n = where n is the winding number. Note that in the above case the exact values of g and Pq are essentially irrelevant all that is needed is for them to be such that the adiabatic regime holds. On the other hand, outside the adiabatic regime, the interaction term does not completely dominate the other terms, the exact values of g and Pq become essential, and the consequences of the measurement are much more complicated; this case is outside of our present interest. Consider now the case, of a free reference particle in 3-dimensions, the appropriate
 transformation which maps: sx = U(3d) sx U(3d) = n · s is ^

A(2d )dl = n,

(8)

U(3d) = e-i(-/2)sy e-i(sz -1/2) , where  and  are spherical angles. [4] The corresponding 3-dimensional vector-potential is in this case A(3d)x = -sy A(3d)y = -sy sin  cos  cos  + sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 , r r sin  cos  cos  sin  - sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 , r r sin  sin  A(3d)z = sy . r

(9)

(10) (11) (12)

For the case of an integer spin or angular momentum the 1/2 above is omitted. It can be verified that A(3d) corresponds to a pure gauge non-Abelian vector potential. The field strength vanishes locally, Fµ = µ A - Aµ -[Aµ , A ] = 0. Thus the force on the reference particle vanishes. Furthermore since the loop integral, A(3d ) · dr, gives rise to a trivial flux 2n, the manifold is simply connected. (This can be seen by noticing that the magnetic 5

field,  × A(3d) , due to the terms proportional to sy vanishes. The other terms correspond to a fluxon pointing in the z -direction with total flux  = sz sin  + sx cos  - 1/2 which is ^ quantized for spin components along the direction /2 - .) Thus, as in the 2-d case, in absence of coupling with the measuring device, A(3d) is a pure gauge vector potential. In the adiabatic limit discussed above, during the measurement we have sz  sy  0. The effective vector potential seen by the reference particle A(3d) = sx cos  - 1/2 ^  , r sin  (13)

is identical to the (asymptotical, r  ) non-Abelian 't Hooft - Polyakov monopole [5] in the unitary gauge. The effective magnetic field,  × A(3d) : B = sx r r3 (14)

corresponds to that of a magnetic monopole at the origin, r = 0, with a magnetic charge m = sx . The topological vector potential obtained above, clearly have an observable manifestation. Upon rotation of the reference particle around the z axis, the particle accumulates ^ an Aharonov-Bohm phase: n = A(3d) · dr = -n(1 - cos ), (15)

which equals half of the solid angle subtended by the path. The latter can be observable by means of a standard interference experiment. We thus conclude that during a continuous measurement the back-reaction on the reference particle takes the form of a topological vector potential, of a semi-fluxon in 2-dimensions and that of a monopole in 3-dimensions. Our discussion above can also be restated in terms of Berry phases. Viewing the reference particle as a slowly changing environment, and the spin system as a fast system which is driven by a time dependent `environment', we can use the Born-Oppenheimer procedure 6

to solve for the spin's eigenstates. Let us assume for simplicity that g0 is sufficiently large so Hs can be neglected, and that g(t) is roughly constant. Considering for simplicity the 2-dimensional case, the appropriate eigenstate equation therefore reads gq^ () · s|() = E|() , n (16)

where  is here viewed as the external parameter. For simplicity let us consider the case of s = 1/2. We obtain: 1 |± () =  e-i/2 | z ± e+i/2 | z 2  |q . (17)

The eigenfunctions |± are double-valued in the angle . Thus a cyclic motion in space, which changes  by 2, induces a sign change. The latter is due to the `spinorial nature' of fermionic particles, which as is well known, flips sign under a 2 rotation [6]. To obtain the appropriate Berry phase we need to construct single valued solutions of Eq. (17): |() = e-i(sz +1/2) | x = e-i | z ± | z It then follows that the Berry phase [3]: Berry = i ()|  |() d = n , r (19)  |q . (18)

is identical to the phase, (8), which is induced by the effective semi-fluxon. Similarly, the Berry phase in the 3-dimensional case corresponds to half of the solid angle subtended by the path of the reference particle. In conclusion, we have shown that the quantum mechanical back-reaction during a measurement induces in certain cases a topological vector potential. The Berry phase can be viewed in this framework, as a necessary consequence of the "strong" nature of the quantum back-reaction.

Explanation of the violation of Bell's inequality by maintaining Einstein separability

A new theory is proposed that offers a consistent conceptual basis for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The violation of Bell's inequality is explained by maintaining realism, inductive inference and Einstein separability.

03.65.Bz

Despite the successes of quantum mechanics its basic concepts, especially the measurement and the collapse of the wave function [1] has remained unclear and controversial up to these days. From the theoretical point of view, the most serious problem is probably the violation of Bell's inequality [2], as it is believed to be the proof that Einstein separability is violated in Nature. Einstein separability is an obvious physical requirement stating that separated systems (i.e., which are prevented from any interaction with each other) cannot influence each other. As a brief reminder, let us think of two spin-half particles in an entangled state, which is due to some previous interaction between them. Suppose that the particles are already separated so much that they can no longer interact with each other. Imagine that we perform spin measurements in different directions on each of the two separated particles. It is natural to assume that any correlation between the results of the measurements performed on the different particles can come only from the previous interaction which created the entangled state. One may also assume that there are some stable properties attached to each system, so that these properties 'store' the correlation after the systems have become separated. Using these assumptions one may derive that the correlations cannot be arbitrary but must satisfy a certain inequality. This is Bell's inequality. The correlations may be calculated quantum mechanically, and the quantum prediction does not always satisfy Bell's inequality. Correlations are measurable quantities, and experiments [3] have proved the correctness of the quantum prediction and thus the violation of Bell's inequality. Most people seem to believe that the above result implies that separated systems can influence each other. This belief is based on the careful analysis of the above sketched derivation of Bell's inequality. It turns out that this derivation is completely independent of quantum mechanics, and it is based on a few very fundamental assumptions [4]: realism, inductive inference and Einstein separability. Realism and inductive inference are so important in physics that we certainly do not want to give 1

up them. The usual conclusion is that Einstein separability is violated. Nevertheless, we maintain that such a conclusion is physically unacceptable. The principle of Einstein separability has served us well in every branch of physics, even in quantum physics, including the most sophisticated quantum field theories. The only way out can be if there is some further, independent and hidden assumption, which seems to us obvious, but which is not valid in quantum mechanics. In the present letter it will be shown that it is indeed the case. One may reinterpret the meaning and the interrelations of the quantum states such a manner that the violation of Bell's inequality gains a natural explanation without giving up realism, inductive inference or Einstein separability. The hidden, not allowed assumption mentioned above is connected to the fact that in the new theory it may happen that different states, although individually exist, cannot be compared. In case of the violation of Bell's inequality it turns out that the states of the measuring devices and those which 'store' the correlations are not comparable as any attempt for a comparison changes the correlations themselves. Therefore, the usual picture about stable properties which 'store' the correlations and are comparable in principle at any time with anything does not apply, although the correlations may be attributed exclusively to the 'common past' (previous interaction) of the particles. To begin with, let us consider a simple example, ^ namely, an idealized measurement of an Sz spin component of some spin- 1 particle. Be the particle P initially 2 in the state | > +| >, where ||2 + ||2 = 1 and ^ the states | > and | > are the eigenstates of Sz corh ¯ h ¯ responding to the eigenvalues 2 and - 2 , respectively. The dynamics of the measurement is given by the relations | > |m0 >  | > |m > and | > |m0 >  | > |m >, where |m0 >, |m > and |m > stand for states of the measuring device M . The linearity of the Schr¨dinger equation implies that the measurement o process can be written as (| > +| >)|m0 >  | >= | > |m > +| > |m >

Let us consider now the state of the measuring device M after the measurement. As the combined system P + M is in an entangled state, the measuring device has no own wave function and may be described by the reduced density matrix [5]

M = T rP (| >< |) ^ = |m > || < m | + |m > || < m | ,
2 2

(2)

where T rP stands for the trace operation in the Hilbert space of the particle P . Nevertheless, if we look at the ¯ ¯ measuring device, we certainly see that either h or - h 2 2 spin component has been measured, that correspond to the states |m > and |m >, respectively. These are obviously not the same as the state (2). Why do we get different states? According to orthodox quantum mechanics, one may argue as follows. The reduced density matrix M has been calculated from the state | > (cf. ^ Eq.(1)) of the whole system P + M . A state is a result of a measurement (the preparation), so we may describe M by M if we have gained our information about M from a ^ measurement done on P + M . On the other hand, looking at the measuring device directly is equivalent with a measurement done directly on M . In this case M is described by either |m > or |m >. We may conclude that performing measurements on different systems (each containing the system we want to decribe) gives rise to different descriptions (in terms of different states). Let us call the system which has been measured (it is P + M in the first case and M in the second case) the quantum reference system. Using this terminology, we may tell that we make a measurement on the quantum reference system R, thus we prepare its state |R > and using this information we calculate the state S (R) = T rR\S |R >< R | of ^ a subsystem S. We shall call S (R) the state of S with ^ respect to R. Obviously R (R) = |R >< R |, thus ^ |R > may be identified with the state of the system R with respect to itself. For brevity we shall call this the internal state of R. Let us emphasize that up to now, despite of the new terminology, there is nothing new in the discussion. We have merely considered some rather elementary consequences of basic quantum mechanics. Let us return now to the question why the state of the system S (i.e., S (R)) depends on the choice of the quan^ tum reference system R. In the spirit of the Copenhagen interpretation one would answer that in quantum mechanics measurements unavoidably disturb the systems, therefore, if we perform measurements on different surroundings R, this disturbance is different, and this is reflected in the R-dependence of S (R). Nevertheless, this ^ argument is not compelling. At this decisive point we leave the traditional framework of quantum mechanics and assume that the states of the systems have already existed before the measurements, and that there may exist measurements which do not change these states. Then the R-dependence of S (R) becomes an inherent property ^ of quantum mechanics. The meaning of the quantum reference systems is now analogous to the classical coordinate systems. Choosing a classical coordinate system means that we imagine what we would experience if we were there. Similarly, 2

choosing a quantum reference system R means that we imagine what we would experience if we did a measurement on R that does not disturbe R (R) = |R >< R |. ^ In order to see that such a measurement exists, consider ^ an operator A (which acts on the Hilbert space of R) ^ whose eigenstates include |R >. The measurement of A will not disturbe |R >. Let us emphasize that the possibility of nondisturbing measurements is an expression of realism: the state R (R) exists independently whether ^ we measure it or not. As the dependence of S (R) on R is a fundamental ^ property now, one has to specify the relation of the different states in terms of suitable postulates: Postulate A.If the reference system R = I is an isolated one 1 then the state S (I) commutes with the inter^ nal state S (S). ^ This means that the internal state of S coincides with one of the eigenstates of S (I). Therefore, we shall call ^ the eigenstates of S (I) the possible internal states of S ^ provided that the reference system I is an isolated one. Postulate B.The result of a measurement is contained unambigously in the internal state of the measuring device. Postulate C. If there are n (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) disjointed physical systems, denoted by S1 , S2 , ...Sn , all contained in the isolated reference system I and having the possible internal states |S1 ,j > , ..., |Sn ,j >, respectively, then the joint probability that |Si ,ji > coincides with the internal state of Si (i = 1, ..n) is given by P (S1 , j1 , ..., Sn , jn ) ^   = T rS1 +...+Sn [^S1 ,j1 ...^Sn ,jn S1 +...+Sn (I)],

(3)

where Si ,ji = |Si ,ji >< Si ,ji |. ^ Furthermore, the time dependent Schr¨dinger equao tion remains valid for closed systems. Note that in the present theory there is no collapse or reduction of the wave function, and every conclusion should be drawn by using the above rules. Let us consider now a two-particle system P1 + P2 consisting of the separated spin-half particles P1 and P2 . The initial internal state of the two-particle system be cj |P1 ,j > |P2 ,j >

where c1 = a, c2 = -b (certainly |a|2 + |b|2 = 1), |P1 ,1 >= |1, >, |P1 ,2 >= |1, >, |P2 ,1 >= |2, >,

An isolated system is such a system that has not been interacting with the outside world. A closed system is such a system that is not interacting with any other system at the given instant of time (but might have interacted in the past).

|P2 ,2 >= |2, >. When the two-particle system is in the state (4), there are strong correlations between the states P1 (P1 ) ^ ^ = |P1 >< P1 | and P2 (P2 ) = |P2 >< P2 |. Provided that the system P1 +P2 is initially isolated, applying Postulate C we obtain that the probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,j > and |P2 >= |P2 ,k > is P (P1 , j, P2 , k) = |cj |2 j,k . Let us consider now a typical experimental situation, when measurements on both particles are performed. Before the measurements the internal state of the isolated system P1 + M1 + P2 + M2 (P1 , P2 standing for the particles and M1 , M2 for the measuring devices, respectively) is given by while it is

(P1 , j)|P1 ,l > |2 . This may be interpreted in conventional terms: |cl |2 is the probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,l >, and | < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l > |2 is the conditional probability that one gets the j-th result if |P1 >= |P1 ,l >. Thus we see that the initial internal state of P1 determines the outcome of the first measurement in the usual probabilistic sense. But doesn't it mean that the internal states of P1 and P2 play the role of local hidden variables? No, because hidden variables are thought to be comparable with the results of the measurements so that their joint probability may be defined, while in our theory there is no way to define the joint probability P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)), i.e., the probability that initially |P1 >= |P1 ,l1 > and |P2 >= |P2 ,l2 > (2) (1) and finally |M1 >= |mj > and |M2 >= |mk >. Intuitively we would write P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) = |cl1 |2 l1 ,l2 | < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l1 > |2 ×| < (P2 , k)|P2 ,l2 > | , as |cl1 |2 l1 ,l2 is the joint probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,l > and |P2 >= |P2 ,l >, and | < (Pi , j)|Pi ,li > |2 is the conditional probability that one gets the j-th result in the i-th measurement if initially |Pi >= |Pi ,li > (i = 1, 2). Certainly the existence of such a joint probability would immediately imply the validity of Bell's inequality, thus it is absolutely important to understand why this probability does not exist. Let us mention, first of all, that using Postulate C for n = 2, we may calculate the correlation between the measurements, i.e., the joint probability that |M1 >= (2) (1) |mj > and |M2 >= |mk >. We obtain P (M1 , j, M2 , k)

with a time t later, i.e. during and after the measure^ ments. Here Ut (Pi + Mi ) (i = 1, 2) stands for the unitary time evolution operator of the closed system Pi + Mi . Eq.(5) implies (according to Postulate A) that the internal states of the closed systems P1 + M1 and P2 + M2 evolve unitarily and do not influence each other. This time evolution can be given explicitly through the relations |(Pi , j) > |m0 >  |(Pi , j) > |mj >

where i, j = 1, 2 and |(Pi , j) > is the j-th eigenstate of the spin measured on the i-th particle along an axis z (i) which closes an angle i with the original z direction. The time evolution of the internal state of the closed sys(i) tems Pi + Mi is given explicitly by |Pi > |m0 >  (i) >. As we see, j < (Pi , j)|Pi > |(Pi , j) > |mj the i-th measurement process is completely determined by the initial internal state of the particle Pi . Therefore, any correlation between the measurements may only stem from the initial correlation of the internal states of the particles. The calculation of the state M1 (M1 ) (which corre^ sponds to the measured value, cf. Postulate B) needs the state of the whole isolated system P1 + P2 + M1 + M2 . Using Eq.(6) the final state (5) may be written as (1) > l cl < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l >< (P2 , k)|P2 ,l >) |mj j,k ( |mk > |(P1 , j) > |(P2 , k) >. Direct calculation shows that M1 (P1 + P2 + M1 + M2 ) = ^ (1) (1) 2 2 |mj >< mj |. Note j l |cl | | < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l > | that it is independent of the second measurement. Ac(1) cording to Postulate A |M1 > is one of the |mj >-s. The probability to observe the j-th result (up or down 2 spin in a chosen direction) is P (M1 , j) = l |cl | | < 3

This is the usual quantum mechanical expression which violates Bell's inequality and whose correctness is experimentally proven. Thus our theory gives the correct expression for the correlation. Nevertheless, if the joint probability (7) exists, it leads to P (M1 , j, M2 , k) =

|cl |2 | < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l > |2 | < (P2 , k)|P2 ,l > |2 (9)

which satisfies Bell's inequality and contradicts Eq.(8). Let us demonstrate that no such contradiction appears. Evidently, the joint probability P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) can be physically meaningful only if one can compare the initial internal states of P1 and P2 with the final internal states of M1 and M2 by suitable nondisturbing measurements. If we try to compare the initial internal states of

P1 and of P2 with the final internal states of M1 and M2 , the first difficulty appears because we want to compare states given at different times. Nevertheless, as the initial internal state of Pi is uniquely related to the final internal state of the system Pi + Mi , the joint probability P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) (if exists) coincides with P (P1 + M1 , l1 , P2 + M2 , l2 , M1 , j, M2 , k), where all the occuring states are given after the measurements. As the systems P1 + M1 , P2 + M2 , M1 , M2 are not disjointed, our Postulates do not provide us with an expression for the joint probability we are seeking for. If we check |M1 > and |M2 > by suitable nondisturbing measurements, we destroy |P1 +M1 > and |P2 +M2 >, inhibiting any comparison. On the other hand, if we check first |P1 +M1 > and |P2 +M2 >, then P (M1 , j, M2 , k) changes. In fact, after suitable measurements performed on Pi + Mi (which do not change the internal states of ~ Pi + Mi ) by further measuring devices Mi we get for the internal state of the whole system

Do we get then a contradiction with Eq.(8)? No, because applying Postulate C directly for n = 2, we get in this case Eq.(9) instead of Eq.(8). Thus we see that the extra measurements have changed the correlations and our theory gives account of this effect consistently. Summing up, we have seen that the initial internal state of P1 (P2 ) determines the first (second) measurement process, therefore, these states 'carry' the initial correlations and 'transfer' them to the measuring devices. As the measurement processes do not influence each other, the observed correlations may stem only from the 'common past' of the particles. On the other hand, any attempt to compare the initial internal states of P1 and P2 with the results of both measurements changes the correlations, thus a joint probability for the simultaneous existence of these states cannot be defined. This means that the reason for the violation of Bell's inequality is that the usual derivations always assume that the states (or 'stable properties') which carry the initial correlations can be freely compared with the results of the measurements. This comparability is usually thought to be a consequence of realism. According to the present theory, the above assumption goes beyond the requirements of realism and proves to be wrong, because each of the states |P1 +M1 >, |P2 +M2 >, |M1 > and |M2 > 4

Abstract A new theory is proposed offering a consistent conceptual basis for nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox is solved and the violation of Bell's inequality is explained by maintaining realism, inductive inference and Einstein separability.

Introduction

Quantum theory is obviously the greatest achievement in theoretical physics of the 20th century. It has been successfully applied to the description of electrons in atoms, molecules and solids, of nuclei, radiation, elementary particles - an enormous number of different phenomena. Nevertheless, it is astonishing that during all these successes the basic concepts, especially the measurement and the collapse of the wave function [1] (when we confine our considerations to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics only) has remained unclear and controversial, essentially no progress has been achieved for almost 70 years, only the confusion has increased. This unprecedental situation has lead to an irrational 'folklore' in the physics community: most physicists settle for themselves the deep and tantalizing fundamental problems 1

of quantum mechanics by telling that all this is philosophy (and this is not meant to be a compliment), and for all practical purposes standard quantum mechanics is completely satisfactory. Indeed, the last statement is true as long as one compares experimental cross-sections, transition probabilities or spectral wave numbers with the theoretical predictions. Somehow this part of the theory is not sensitive to the logical consistency of the basic concepts.1 Nevertheless, the fundamental problems of quantum mechanics cannot be considered as mere philosophical questions, as two famous results, the EPR paradox[2] and the violation of Bell's inequality[3] clearly demonstrate. Both of these seem to imply that quantum mechanics violates Einstein separability2 , an obvious physical requirement which follows from the principle of locality and means that separated systems (i.e., which are prevented from any interaction with each other) cannot influence each other. When a physical theory violates a well established, basic physical principle, that is certainly not a philosophical problem. In order to look at the problem more closely let us briefly recall the essence of the two results mentioned above. The EPR paradox draws the fact to our attention that if we are given two separated systems in an entangled state (which is the result of a previous interaction), and we perform a measurement on one of the systems, then, according to the usual rules of quantum mechanics, the state of the other, undisturbed system will depend on what a quantity has been measured. This dependence is so strong, that one may end up with such states for the undisturbed system (in case of different measurements), that are eigenstates of noncommuting operators. The violation of Bell's inequality is perhaps even more powerful as it is experimentally proven[5]. Bell's inequality refers to a situation when measurements are performed on each of the separated systems mentioned above. One assumes that any correlation between the results of the measurements performed on the different systems can come only from the previous interaction which created the entangled state. Therefore, one supposes that there are some stable properties attached to each system, so that these properties
Note that this is certainly not the case in quantum cosmology. One important physical motivation for studying the fundamental questions of quantum mechanics is the hope that the correct answer will help establishing the quantum theory of gravitation. 2 At least if one assumes that quantum mechanics is a complete theory (in case of the EPR paradox) and if one maintains realism and inductive inference[4] (in case of the violation of Bell's inequality).

'store' the correlation after the systems have become separated, and they determine (at least in a probabilistic sense) the outcome of the corresponding measurements. With these assumptions one finds that the correlations cannot be arbitrary but must satisfy a certain inequality. This is Bell's inequality. The correlations may be calculated quantum mechanically, and the quantum prediction does not always satisfy Bell's inequality. Correlations are measurable quantities, and experiments have proved the correctness of the quantum prediction and thus the violation of Bell's inequality. What does it mean? Most people seem to believe that the above results indeed imply that separated systems can influence each other. Nevertheless, we maintain that such a conclusion is physically unacceptable. The principle of locality (or Einstein separability) has served us well in every branch of physics, even in quantum physics, including the most sophisticated quantum field theories. It is rather hard to believe that it would fail only in case of measurements. After all, a measurement is just an interaction between two physical systems, one of them being a macroscopic measuring device which consists of atoms whose structure and interactions are rather well understood in terms of quantum mechanics. There is no room for a mysterious nonlocal influence. In case of the EPR paradox it is obvious that if one wants to maintain Einstein separability, he must change the interpretation and must replace the collapse of the wave function with something else. The experimentally observed violation of Bell's inequality is more puzzling. The derivation of Bell's inequality is completely independent of quantum mechanics, it is based on a few very fundamental assumptions[4]: realism, inductive inference and Einstein separability. Realism and inductive inference are not less important in physics than Einstein separability, so we do not want to give up them, either. The only way out can be if there is some further, independent and hidden assumption, which seems to us obvious, but which is not valid in quantum mechanics. In the present letter it will be shown that it is indeed the case. One may reinterpret the meaning and the interrelations of the quantum states such a manner that the EPR paradox and the violation of Bell's inequality gain a natural explanation without giving up realism, inductive inference or Einstein separability. The hidden, not allowed assumption mentioned above is connected to the fact that in the new theory the simultaneous existence of the different states is usually restricted in a particular way, namely, although 3

each state exists separately, they cannot be compared without essentially disturbing the system. In case of the violation of Bell's inequality it turns out that the states of the measuring devices and those which 'store' the correlations are not comparable (as any attempt for a comparison changes the correlations), so the usual picture about stable properties which are comparable at any time with anything and 'store' the correlations does not apply, although the correlations may be attributed exclusively to the 'common past' (previous interaction) of the particles. As we shall see, the theory proposed here involves a rather fundamental change of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. Measurements will not be the primary concepts any longer, there will be no collapse of the wave function, and quantum states exhibit a new kind of dependence on quantum reference systems, a new concept to be explained below. On the other hand, the quantum mechanics of closed systems does not change, especially, Schr¨dinger's equation remains to be valid, and thus all the usual o measurable consequences are unchanged. The only advantage of the present theory is that it respects the principle of locality and offers a consistent and physically acceptable basis for quantum mechanics.

The basic new concept: quantum reference systems

^ Let us consider a simple example, namely, an idealized measurement of an Sz 1 spin component of a spin- 2 particle. Be the particle P initially in the state | > +| > , (1) where ||2 + ||2 = 1 and the states | > and | > are the eigenstates h h ^ of Sz corresponding to the eigenvalues ¯ and - ¯ , respectively. The other 2 2 quantum numbers and variables have been suppressed. The dynamics of the measurement is given by the relations | > |m0 >  | > |m > and | > |m0 >  | > |m >, where |m0 > stands for the state of the measuring device M (e.g. a Stern-Gerlach apparatus) before the measurement (no spot on the photographic plate), while |m > (|m >) is the state of the measuring device after the measurement that corresponds to the measured spin h h value ¯ (- ¯ ). The shorthand notation  stands for the unitary time evolu2 2 tion during the measurement, which is assumed to fulfill the time dependent 4

Schr¨dinger equation corresponding to the total Hamiltonian of the combined o P + M system. As the initial state of the particle is given by Eq.(1), the linearity of the Schr¨dinger equation implies that the measurement process o can be written as (| > +| >)|m0 >  | >= | > |m > +| > |m > . (2)

Let us consider now the state of the measuring device M after the measurement. As the combined system P +M is in an entangled state, the measuring device has no own wave function and may be described by the reduced density matrix[6] M = T rP (| >< |) = |m > ||2 < m | + |m > ||2 < m | , ^ (3)

where T rP stands for the trace operation in the Hilbert space of the particle P . Nevertheless, if we look at the measuring device, we certainly see that h h either ¯ or - ¯ spin component has been measured, that correspond to the 2 2 states |m > and |m >, respectively. These are obviously not the same as the state (3). Indeed, |m > and |m > are pure states while M is a mixture ^ of them. Why do we get different states? According to orthodox quantum mechanics, one may argue as follows. The reduced density matrix M has ^ been calculated from the state | > (cf. Eq.(2)) of the whole system P + M. A state is a result of a measurement (the preparation), so we may describe M by M if we have gained our information about M from a measurement ^ done on P + M. On the other hand, looking at the measuring device directly is equivalent with a measurement done directly on M. In this case M is described by either |m > or |m >. We may conclude that performing measurements on different systems (each containing the system we want to decribe) gives rise to different descriptions (in terms of different states). Let us call the system which has been measured (it is P + M in the first case and M in the second case) the quantum reference system. Using this terminology, we may tell that we make a measurement on the quantum reference system R, thus we prepare its state |R > and using this information we calculate the state S (R) = T rR\S |R >< R | of a subsystem S. We shall call S (R) ^ ^ the state of S with respect to R. Obviously R (R) = |R >< R |, thus ^ |R > may be identified with the state of the system R with respect to itself. Let us emphasize that up to now, despite of the new terminology, there is nothing new in the discussion. We have merely considered some rather elementary consequences of basic quantum mechanics. 5

Let us return now to the question why the state of the system S (i.e., S (R)) depends on the choice of the quantum reference system R. In the ^ spirit of the Copenhagen interpretation one would answer that in quantum mechanics measurements unavoidably disturb the systems, therefore, if we perform measurements on different surroundings R, this disturbance is different, and this is reflected in the R-dependence of S (R). Nevertheless, this ^ argument is not compelling. We may also assume that the states of the systems have already existed before the measurements, and that there may exist measurements which do not change these states. Then the R-dependence of S (R) becomes an inherent property of quantum mechanics. Let us leave ^ at this decisive point the traditional framework of quantum mechanics and follow the new line just sketched. The meaning of the quantum reference systems is now analogous to the classical coordinate systems. Choosing a classical coordinate system means that we imagine what we would experience if we were there. Similarly, choosing a quantum reference system R means that we imagine what we would experience if we did a measurement on R that does not disturbe R (R) = |R >< R |. In order to see that such a measurement exists, ^ ^ consider an operator A (which acts on the Hilbert space of R) whose eigen^ states include |R >. The measurement of A will not disturbe |R >. Let us emphasize that the possibility of nondisturbing measurements is an expression of realism: the state R (R) exists independently whether we measure it ^ or not. As the dependence of S (R) on R is a fundamental property now, one has ^ to specify the relation of the different states in terms of suitable postulates. Below we list these postulates.

3

Rules of the new framework

Postulate 1. The system S to be described is a subsystem of the reference system R. Postulate 2. The state S (R) is a positive definite, Hermitian operator ^ with unit trace, acting on the Hilbert space of S. Definition 1. S (S) is called the internal state of S. ^ Postulate 3. The internal states S (S) are always projectors, i.e., ^ S (S) = |S >< S |. ^ 6

In the following these projectors will be identified with the corresponding wave functions |S > (as they are uniquely related, apart from a phase factor). Postulate 4. The state of a system S with respect to the reference system R (denoted by S (R)) is the reduced density matrix of S calculated from the ^ internal state of R, i.e. S (R) = T rR\S (^R (R)), where R \ S stands for the ^  subsystem of R complementer to S. Definition 2.An isolated system is such a system that has not been interacting with the outside world. A closed system is such a system that is not interacting with any other system at the given instant of time (but might have interacted in the past). Postulate 5.If I is an isolated system then its state is independent of the reference system R: I (R) = I (I). ^ ^ Postulate 6.If the reference system R = I is an isolated one then the state S (I) commutes with the internal state S (S). ^ ^ This means that the internal state of S coincides with one of the eigenstates of S (I). ^ Definition 3.The possible internal states are the eigenstates of S (I) ^ provided that the reference system I is an isolated one. Postulate 7. If I is an isolated system, then the probability P (S, j) that the eigenstate |S,j > of S (I) coincides with S (S) is given by the ^ ^ corresponding eigenvalue j . Postulate 8.The result of a measurement is contained unambigously in the internal state of the measuring device. Postulate 9. If there are n (n = 2, 3, ...) disjointed physical systems, denoted by S1 , S2 , ...Sn , all contained in the isolated reference system I and having the possible internal states |S1 ,j >, |S2,j >, ..., |Sn,j >, respectively, then the joint probability that |Si,ji > coincides with the internal state of Si (i = 1, ..n) is given by P (S1 , j1 , S2 , j2 , ..., Sn , jn ) ^  ^  = T rS1 +S2 +...+Sn [^S1 ,j1 S2 ,j2 ...^Sn ,jn S1 +S2 +...+Sn (I)],

(4)

where Si ,ji = |Si,ji >< Si ,ji |. ^ Postulate 10.The internal state |C > of a closed system C satisfies the ^ time dependent Schr¨dinger equation i¯ t |C >= H|C >. o h 7

^ Here H stands for the Hamiltonian. It is an important feature of the theory that the states defined with respect to different quantum reference systems are not necessarily comparable. What does it mean? As we have seen one may determine the state R (R) of any ^ system R without disturbing it if one performs a suitable measurement on R. We may do it with one arbitrarily chosen system R. But can we do this with two (or more) systems R1 , R2 (R3 , ...) at the same time (or in succession)? In other terms: may we always attribute a physical meaning to the simultaneous existence of R1 (R1 ) and R2 (R2 )? The answer is no. If ^ ^ we perform a nondisturbing measurement on R1 , this will disturbe R2 (R2 ) ^ except when R2  R1 or R1  R2 = . Let us demonstrate this phenomenon on a simple example. Consider two different spin- 1 particles P1 and P2 and 2 be R1 = P1 , R2 = P1 + P2 . Suppose that P1 + P2 is initially an isolated system and |P1 +P2 >= a|1, > |2, > -b|1, > |2, > , (5)

where |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. The notation |1, > stands for such a state of the first ^ particle, where the z component of the spin (denoted by S1z ) has the definite h ¯ value + 2 . The other notations have an analogous meaning. Further, suppose ^ that |P1 >= |1, >. Measuring Sz on P1 we may write |P1 +P2 > |m0 >  a|1, > |2, > |m > -b|1, > |2, > |m > , (6)

where |m0 >, |m > and |m > are the states of the measuring device M as defined earlier. Eq.(6) implies P1 +P2 (P1 + P2 + M) = |1, > |2, > |a|2 < 2,  | < 1,  | ^ + |1, > |2, > |b|2 < 2,  | < 1,  |

(7)

thus |P1 +P2 > has changed and has become due to the measurement either |1, > |2, > or |1, > |2, >. We may summarize this situation as follows: all the states S (R) exist ^ individually (where R and S  R may be any existing system), as we may choose a system R at will and may perform a suitable measurement on it in order to learn the states S (R) (now R is fixed) without changing them. ^ Nevertheless, once we perform this measurement we unavoidably disturb the 8

~ ~ states S (R) when R  R and R  R = , thus preventing us from learning ^~ ~ these latter states. Therefore, no physical meaning may be attributed to the simultaneous existence of the states S (R) and S (R) although they do exist ^ ^~ ~ separately. One may perhaps think that the above property questions the reality of the states or the realism of the theory. Let us consider a simple classical analogue demonstrating this is not the case. It is known that general relativity allows coordinate systems even inside of a black hole. Consider now two different black holes and introduce a coordinate system inside each of them. Probably no one doubts the reality of the descriptions with respect to these coordinate systems. We may indeed check what we may experience with respect to one of these systems. We may freely choose one of the black holes and may fall into it. Then we see what is inside. However, if we do so we cannot come back and thus automatically prevent ourselves from learning the other blackhole interieur. Therefore, similarly to the quantum case, no physical meaning can be attributed to the simultaneous existence of descriptions with respect to the above two coordinate systems. Of course, we do not want to say that there is any deeper connection between the underlying physics of the quantum case and that of the above classical example. Let us mention one more unusual feature of the quantum reference systems, namely, that the states of the same system with respect to different quantum reference systems are not uniquely related. Indeed, in our first example (cf. Eq.(3)) M (P + M) = |m > ||2 < m | + |m > ||2 < m | , ^ while M (M) can be either |m > (with probability ||2 ) or |m > (with ^ probability ||2). Certainly this feature is an expression of the indeterministic nature of quantum mechanics. Let us mention finally that, strictly speaking, the whole formalism of the present theory is connected to the experience only via Postulate 8. One can indeed see that measurement is not the primary concept any longer. The theory works such a way that - on the basis of the results of previous measurements - one assumes an initial state of an isolated system which includes the present measuring device as well, calculates the final state from the Schr¨dinger equation and finally, using the Postulates, deduces the state o M (M) of the measuring device M to get a prediction concerning the outcome ^ of the measurement. Certainly, this prediction will be usually probabilistic.

Solution of the EPR paradox

Consider again the two-particle system P1 + P2 (cf. Eq.(5) ). Suppose one performs a measurement on the first particle. Let us consider the situation ^ when one measures S1z  , where the z  axis is obtained from the z axis by a rotation at an angle  around the x axis. The initial state of the whole system (including the measuring device) is given by |m0 > (a|1, > |2, > -b|1, > |2, >) , where |m0 > stands for the initial state of the measuring device. The time evolution during the measurement can be established by using the relations |m0 > |1, , >  |m+ > |1, , > and |m0 > |1, , >    |m- > |1, , >, where |1, , >= cos( 2 )|1, > - sin( 2 )|1, > , and   |1, , >= sin( 2 )|1, > + cos( 2 )|1, > . Thus the final state of the whole system is   |m+ > |1, , > a cos( )|2, > +b sin( )|2, > 2 2   +|m- > |1, , > a sin( )|2, > -b cos( )|2, > 2 2

.

(8)

According to the Copenhagen interpretation one ought to apply the concept of the reduction of the wave function, which yields that the state of the second, undisturbed particle has the state (after the measurement) |+ >=   |a| cos ( ) + |b|2 sin2 ( ) 2 2

10

Indeed, P1 +P2 (P1 + P2 + M) ^   (2) (2) = |1, , > |+ > |a|2 cos2 ( ) + |b|2 sin2 ( ) < + | < 1, ,  | 2 2   (2) (2) +|1, , > |- > |a|2 sin2 ( ) + |b|2 cos2 ( ) < - | < 1, ,  | . 2 2 Its eigenstates are |1, , > |+ > and |1, , > |- > .

(11)

(12)

Thus P1 +P2 (P1 + P2 ) = |P1 +P2 >< P1 +P2 | where |P1 +P2 > coincides with ^ either (11) or (12). Calculating P2 (P1 + P2 ) = T rP1 (^P1 +P2 (P1 + P2 )) we ^  (2) (2) (2) (2) arrive at the expressions |+ >< + or |- >< - | (cf. Eqs.(9),(10), respectively). The dependence on  is now easily understood: the measurement done on P1 influences the quantum reference system P1 + P2 , hence P2 (P1 + P2 ) depends on the measurement, although P2 has not been influ^ enced. Certainly, Einstein separability is not violated. Einstein separability requires now that P2 (P2 ) must be independent of ^ the measurement done on P1 . Direct calculation shows that P2 (P1 +P2 +M) ^ is the same both before and after the measurement, thus its eigenstates are unchanged, too. Therefore, P2 (P2 ) is not influenced by the measurement. ^ One may also prove[7] that quite generally, if the system A is separated from the systems B and C, A (A) is independent of the interaction between B ^ and C.

Explanation of the violation of Bell's inequality

Let us consider again the previous two-particle system. In order to exhibit the mathematical structure we write the state (5) as cj |P1,j > |P2,j >
j

(13)

11

where c1 = a, c2 = -b, |P1 ,1 >= |1, >, |P1 ,2 >= |1, >, |P2 ,1 >= |2, >, |P2 ,2 >= |2, >. When the two particle system is in the state (13), there are strong correlations between the states P1 (P1 ) = |P1 >< P1 | and P2 (P2 ) = ^ ^ |P2 >< P2 |. Provided that the system P1 + P2 is initially isolated, applying Postulate 9 we obtain that the probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,j > and |P2 >= |P2,k > is P (P1, j, P2 , k) = |cj |2 j,k . Let us consider now a typical experimental situation, when measurements on both particles are performed. We shall show that according to the present theory the observed correlations are exclusively due to the previous interaction between the particles. Before the measurements the internal state of the isolated system P1 + M1 + P2 + M2 (P1 , P2 stands for the particles and M1 , M2 for the measuring devices, respectively) is given by (1) (2) j cj |P1 ,j > |P2 ,j > |m0 > |m0 >, while it is
(1) (2) ^ ^ cj Ut (P1 + M1 ) |P1 ,j > |m0 > Ut (P2 + M2 ) |P2 ,j > |m0 > j

, (14)

^ a time t later, i.e. during and after the measurements. Here Ut (Pi + Mi ) (i = 1, 2) stands for the unitary time evolution operator of the closed system Pi + Mi . Eq.(14) implies that the internal states of the closed systems P1 + M1 and P2 +M2 evolve unitarily and do not influence each other. This time evolution can be given explicitly through the relations |(Pi, j) > |m0 >  |(Pi, j) > |mj > ,
(i) (i)

(15)

where i, j = 1, 2 and |(Pi, j) > is the j-th eigenstate of the spin measured on the i-th particle along an axis z (i) which closes an angle i with the original z direction. The time evolution of the internal state of the closed systems (i) Pi + Mi is given explicitly by |Pi > |m0 >  j < Pi ,j |Pi > |Pi ,j > (i) |mj >. As we see, the i-th measurement process is completely determined by the initial internal states of the particle Pi . Therefore, any correlation between the measurements may only stem from the initial correlation of the internal states of the particles. For the calculation of the state M1 (M1 ) (which corresponds to the mea^ sured value) one needs to know the state of the whole isolated system P1 +

12

P2 + M1 + M2 . Using Eq.(15) the final state (14) may be written as cl < (P1, j)|P1 ,l >< (P2 , k)|P2,l >
j,k l

×|mj > |mk > |(P1 , j) > |(P2 , k) > . Direct calculation shows that M1 (P1 + P2 + M1 + M2 ) ^ =

Note that it is independent of the second measurement. (1) According to Postulate 6 |M1 > is one of the |mj >-s. (Similarly (2) one may derive that |M2 > is one of the |mk >-s.) The probability of the observation of the j-th result (up or down spin in a chosen direction) is P (M1 , j) =

|cl |2 | < (P1 , j)|P1,l > |2 .

(16)

This may be interpreted in conventional terms: |cl |2 is the probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,l >, and | < (P1 , j)|P1 ,l > |2 is the conditional probability that one gets the j-th result if |P1 >= |P1 ,l >. Thus we see that the initial internal state of P1 determines the outcome of the first measurement in the usual probabilistic sense. One may show quite similarly that the initial internal state of P2 determines the outcome of the second measurement in the same way. But doesn't it mean that the internal states of P1 and P2 play the role of local hidden variables? Not at all, because hidden variables are thought to be comparable with the results of the measurements so that their joint probability may be defined, while in our theory there is no way to define the joint probability P (P1, l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)), i.e., the probability that initially |P1 >= |P1 ,l1 > and |P2 >= |P2,l2 > and finally |M1 >= (1) (2) |mj > and |M2 >= |mk >. Intuitively we would write P (P1, l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) = |cl1 |2 l1 ,l2 | < (P1 , j)|P1,l1 > |2 | < (P2, k)|P2 ,l2 > |2 , 13 (17)

as |cl1 |2 l1 ,l2 is the joint probability that |P1 >= |P1 ,l > and |P2 >= |P2 ,l >, and | < (Pi, j)|Pi,li > |2 is the conditional probability that one gets the j-th result in the i-th measurement if initially |Pi >= |Pi ,li > (i = 1, 2). Certainly the existence of such a joint probability would immediately imply the validity of Bell's inequality, thus it is absolutely important to understand why this probability does not exist. Let us mention, first of all, that using Postulate 9 for n = 2, we may calculate the correlation between the measurements, i.e., the joint probability (1) (2) that |M1 >= |mj > and |M2 >= |mk >. We obtain
2

P (M1 , j, M2 , k) =
l

cl < (P1, j)|P1 ,l >< (P2, k)|P2 ,l >

.

(18)

This is the usual quantum mechanical expression which violates Bell's inequality and whose correctness is experimentally proven. Thus our theory gives the correct expression for the correlation. Nevertheless, if the joint probability (17) exists, it leads to P (M1 , j, M2 , k) =
l

|cl |2 | < (P1 , j)|P1,l > |2 | < (P2, k)|P2 ,l > |2

(19)

which satisfies Bell's inequality and contradicts Eq.(18). Let us demonstrate that no such contradiction appears. Evidently, the joint probability P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) can be physically meaningful only if one can compare the initial internal states of P1 and P2 with the final internal states of M1 and M2 by suitable nondisturbing measurements. It turns out, however, that any attempt for such a comparison influences the system so strongly that the correlations P (M1 , j, M2 , k) change. If we try to compare the initial internal states of P1 and of P2 with the final internal states of M1 and M2 , the first difficulty appears because we want to compare states given at different times. Nevertheless, as the initial internal state of Pi is uniquely related to the final internal state of the system Pi +Mi , the joint probability P (P1 , l1 , P2 , l2 , (0); M1 , j, M2 , k, (t)) (if exist) coincides with P (P1 +M1 , l1 , P2 +M2 , l2 , M1 , j, M2 , k), where all the occuring states are given after the measurements. As the systems P1 +M1 , P2 +M2 , M1 , M2 are not disjointed, our Postulates do not provide us with an expression for the joint probability we are seeking for. If we check |M1 > and |M2 > by suitable nondisturbing measurements, we destroy |P1 +M1 > and |P2 +M2 > (cf. 14

the discussion at the end of Section 2.), inhibiting any comparison. On the other hand, if we check first |P1 +M1 > and |P2 +M2 >, then P (M1 , j, M2 , k) changes.3 Indeed, after suitable measurements performed on Pi + Mi (which do not change the internal states of Pi + Mi )4 by further measuring devices ~ Mi we get for the internal state of the whole system cl

~ ~ As the systems M1 , M2 , M1 , M2 are disjointed, we may apply Postulate 9 ~ ~ for n = 4 and we indeed get for P (M1 , l1 , M2 , l2 , M1 , j, M2 , k) the expression (17). Do we get then a contradiction with Eq.(18)? No, because applying Postulate 9 for n = 2 directly, we get in this case Eq.(19) instead of Eq.(18). Thus we see that the extra measurements have changed the correlations and our theory gives account of this effect consistently. Summarizing, we have seen that the initial internal state of P1 (P2 ) determines the first (second) measurement process, therefore, these states 'carry' the initial correlations and 'transfer' them to the measuring devices. As the measurement processes do not influence each other, the observed correlations may stem only from the 'common past' of the particles. On the other hand, any attempt to compare the initial internal states of P1 and P2 with the results of both measurements changes the correlations, thus a joint probability for the simultaneous existence of these states cannot be defined. This means that the reason for the violation of Bell's inequality is that the usual derivations always assume that the states (or 'stable properties') which carry the initial correlations can be freely compared with the results of the measurements. This comparability is usually thought to be a consequence of realism. According to the present theory, the above assumption goes beyond the requirements of realism and proves to be wrong, because each of
3 Therefore, in the original situation the joint probability P (P1 + M1 , l1 , P2 + M2 , l2 , M1 , j, M2 , k) cannot be defined at all. Here we are faced with the feature of our theory discussed at the end of Section 2: although states with respect to different quantum reference systems do exist individually, their simultaneous occurence or comparatibility may not be defined. 4 This is equivalent by recording the initial internal state of Pi .

15

the states |P1 +M1 >, |P2 +M2 >, |M1 > and |M2 > exists individually, but they cannot be compared without changing the correlations. In conclusion, it has been shown that by suitable redefinition of the physical meaning of the quantum states and their interrelations one can solve the EPR paradox and can explain the violation of Bell's inequality without giving up realism, inductive inference or Einstein separability.

Coding Theorems for Quantum Communication Channels A. S. Holevo Steklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow

arXiv:quant-ph/9708046v1 27 Aug 1997

I. The capacity and the entropy bound Let H be a Hilbert space providing a quantum-mechanical description for the physical carrier of information. A simple model of quantum communication channel consists of the input alphabet A = {1, ..., a} and a mapping i  Si from the input alphabet to the set of quantum states in H. A quantum state is a density operator, i. e. positive operator S in H with unit trace, TrS = 1. Sending a letter i results in producing the signal state Si of the information carrier. Like in the classical case, the input is described by an apriori probability distribution  = {i } on A. At the receiving end of the channel a quantum measurement is performed, which mathematically is described by a resolution of identity in H, that is by a family X = {Xj } of positive operators in H satisfying j Xj = I, where I is the unit operator in H [Holevo 1973]. The probability of the output j conditioned upon the input i by definition is equal to P (j|i) = TrSi Xj . The classical case is embedded into this picture by assuming that all operators in question commute, hence are diagonal in some basis labelled by index ; in fact by taking Si = diag[S(|i)], Xj = diag[X(j|)], we have a classical channel with transition probabilities S(|i) and the classical decision rule X(j|), so that P (j|i) =  X(j|)S(|i). We call such channel quasiclassical. The Shannon information is given by the usual formula I1 (, X) =

The famous quantum entropy bound says that (2)

with the equality achieved if and only if all the operators i Si commute. The inequality was explicitly conjectured in [Gordon 1964], and discussed in [Forney 1963], [Levitin 1969] and elsewhere in the context of conventional quantum measurement theory. The first published proof appeared in [Holevo 1973]. It is worthwhile to mention also that this bound is closely related to the fundamental property of decrease of quantum relative entropy under completely positive maps developed in [Lindblad 1973-1975] and in [Uhlmann 1977] (see [Yuen and Ozawa 1993] for history and some generalizations of the entropy bound). In the same way we can consider the product channel in the tensor product Hilbert space Hn = H  ...  H with the input alphabet An consisting of words w = (i1 , ..., in ) of length n, and with the density operator Sw = Si1 ...Sin corresponding to the word w. If  is an apriori distribution on An and X is a resolution of identity in Hn , we define the information quantity In (, X) by the formula similar to (1). Denoting Cn = sup,X In (, X), we have the property of superadditivity Cn + Cm  Cn+m , hence the following limit exists C = lim Cn /n,
n

which is called the capacity of the initial channel [Holevo 1979]. This definition is justified by the fact easily deduced from the classical Shannon's coding theorem, that C is the least upper bound of the rate (bits/symbol) of information which can be transmitted with asymptotically vanishing error. More precisely, we call by code (W, X) of size M a sequence (w 1 , X1 ), ..., (w M , XM ), where w k are words of length n, and {Xk } is a family of positive operators in Hn , satisfying M Xk  I. Defining X0 = I - M Xk , we have a k=1 k=1 resolution of identity in Hn . The average error probability for such a code is 1 M ¯ (W, X) = (3) [1 - TrSwk Xk ]. M k=1 2

Let us denote p(M, n) the minimum of this error probability with respect to all codes of the size M with words of length n. Then p(2n(C-) , n)  0 and p(n, 2n(C+) )  0, where  > 0, as n  . Applied to In (, X) and combined with the additivity and continuity ¯ properties of H() the entropy bound (2) implies C  max H()  C. Thus ¯ C1  C  C. For a classical channel Cn = nC1 , and all the three quantities coincide. A striking feature of quantum case is possibility of the inequality C1 < C implying strict superadditivity of the information quantities Cn [Holevo 1979]. In a sense, there is a kind of "quantum memory" in channels, which are the analog of classical memoryless channels. This fact is just another manifestation of the "quantum nonseparability", and in a sense is dual to the existence of Einstein - Podolsky - Rosen correlations: the latter are due to entangled (non-factorizable) states and hold for disentangled measurements while the superadditivity is due to entangled measurements and holds for disentangled states. The inequality C = C1 raised the problem of the actual value of the ca¯ pacity C. A possible conjecture was C = C, but the proof for it came only recently, first for the pure state (noiseless) channels in the paper of Hausladen, Jozsa, Schumacher, Westmoreland and Wootters [Hausladen et al. 1996], and then for the case of arbitrary signal states in [Holevo 1996] and in [Schumacher and Westmoreland 1997]. Since the entropy bound (2) and the classical weak converse provide the converse of the quantum coding theorem, the main problem was the proof of the direct coding theorem, i. e. of the ¯ inequality C  C. II. The pure state channel Following Dirac's formalism, we shall denote vectors of H as | >, and hermitean conjugate vector of the dual space ­ as < |. Then < | > is the inner product of | >, | > and | >< | is the outer product, i. e. operator A of rank 1, acting on vector | > as A| >= | >< | > . If | > is a unit vector, then | >< | is the orthogonal projection onto | >. This is a special density operator, representing pure state of the system. Pure states are precisely extreme points of the convex set of all states; an arbitrary state 3

can be represented as a mixture of pure states, i. e. by imposing classical randomness on pure states. In this sense pure states are "noiseless", i. e. they contain no classical source of randomness. Let us consider a pure state channel with Si = |i>< i | . Since the en¯ tropy of a pure state is zero, H() = H(S ) for such a channel. If a decision rule X = {Xj } is applied at the output then P (j|i) =< i |Xj i > . A system {|j >} of (unnormalized) vectors is called overcomplete if j |j >< j | = I. Every overcomplete system gives rise to the decision rule Xj = |j >< j | for which P (j|i) = | < i |j > |2 . The first step in getting a lower bound for the capacity C has geometric nature and amounts to obtaining a tractable upper bound for the average error (3) minimized over all decision rules. Sending a word w = (i1 , . . . , in ) produces the tensor product vector w = i1 . . .in  Hn . Let (W, X) be a code of size M. Let us restrict for a while to the subspace of Hn generated by the vectors w1 , . . . , wM , and consider the Gram matrix (W ) = [< wi |wj >] and the Gram operator G(W ) = M |wk >< wk |. This k=1 operator has the matrix (W ) with respect to the overcomplete system ^ |wk >= G(W )-1/2 |wk > ; The resolution of identity of the form ^ ^ Xk = |k >< k | (5) k = 1, . . . , M . (4)

approximates the quantum maximum likelihood decision rule (which in general cannot be found explicitly); the necessary normalizing factor G(W )-1/2 is a major source of analytical difficulties in the noncommutative case. Note that the vectors w1 , . . . , wM need not be linearly independent; in the case of linearly independent coherent state vectors (5) is related to the "suboptimal receiver" described in [Helstrom 1976], Sec. VI.3(e). It was shown in [Holevo 1978] that by using this decision rule one obtains the upper bound ¯ min (X, W )

where E is the unit M ×M-matrix and Sp is the trace of M ×M-matrix. This bound is "tight" in the sense that there is a similar lower bound. However it is difficult to use because of the presence of square root of the Gram matrix. 4

As shown in [Holevo 1978], this bound is asymptotically equivalent (up to the factor 1/4) to the tight bound (6) in the limit of "almost orthogonal" states (W )  E. On the other hand, different words are "decoupled" in (7) which makes it suitable for application of the random coding. Just as in the classical case, we assume that the words w 1 , ..., w M are chosen at random, independently and with the probability distribution P{w = (i1 , . . . , in )} = 1 . . . n . Then for each word w the expectation ¯n E Sw = S , (9) (8)

~ we conclude that C  C . There are cases (e. g. pure state binary channel) ~ > C1 , so this is sufficient to establish C > C1 , and hence the where C strict superadditivity of Cn [Holevo 1979], but not sufficient to prove the ~ ¯ coding theorem, since C < C unless the channel is quasiclassical. A detailed ¯ comparison of the quantities C1 , C for different quantum channels was made by Ban, Hirota, Kato, Osaki and Suzuki [Kato et al. 1996]. The quantity ~ C was discussed in [Holevo 1979], [Stratonovich and Vantsjan 1978], but its real information theoretic meaning is elucidated only in connection with the quantum reliability function (see (15) below). ¯ The proof of the inequality C  C given in [Hausladen et al. 1996] achieves the goal by using the approximate maximum likelihood improved 5

¯n with projection onto the "typical subspace" of the density operator S and the correspondingly modified coarse bound for the error probability. The coarseness of the bound is thus compensated by eliminating "non-typical" (and hence far from being orthogonal) components of the signal state vectors. More precisely, let us fix small positive , and let j be the eigenvalues, ¯ ¯n |ej > the eigenvectors of S . Then the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S are J = j1 · ... · jn , |eJ >= |ej1 > ...  |ejn > where J = (j1 , ..., jn ). The spectral projector onto the typical subspace is defined as P =
JB ¯

|eJ >< eJ |,
¯

where B = {J : 2-n[H(S )+] < J < 2-n[H(S )-] }. This concept plays a central role in "quantum data compression" [Jozsa and Schumacher 1994]. In a more mathematical context a similar notion appeared in [Ohya and Petz 1993], Theorem 1.18. Its application to the present problem relies upon the following two basic properties: first, by definition,
¯ ¯n S P < 2-n[H(S )-] .

(11)

Second, for fixed small positive  and large enough n ¯n TrS (I - P )  , (12)

because a sequence J  B is typical for the probability distribution given by eigenvalues J in the sense of classical information theory [Gallager 1968], [Cover and Thomas 1991]. By replacing the signal state vectors |wk > with unnormalized vectors ~ |wk >= P |wk >, defining the corresponding approximate maximum likeli~ hood decision rule,and denoting (W ) the corresponding Gram matrix, the modified upper bound ¯ min (W, X)

is obtained in [Hausladen et al. 1996]. Applying the random coding and using (9) and the properties (11), (12) of the typical subspace, one gets for large n ¯ p(M, n)  { + (M - 1)2-n[H(S )-] }, 6

¯ resulting in the inequality C  C. It is known, however, that in classical information theory the coding theorem can be proved without resorting to typical sequences, by mere use of clever estimates for the error probability [Gallager 1968]. Moreover, in this way one obtains the exponential rate of convergence for the error probability, the so called reliability function E(R) = lim sup

0<R<C.

This puts us onto the idea of trying to apply the random coding procedure directly to the tight bound (6) in the quantum case. This is realized in [Burnashev and Holevo 1997]. Rather remarkably, the expectation can be calculated explicitly, 2 ¯n E Sp E - (W )1/2 = Tr f (S ), M where f (z) = 2 [1 - M 1 + (M - 1)z + (M - 1)(1 -  1 - z)].

This function strangely resembles the expression for the Bayes error in the "equiangular" case [Helstrom 1976] rel. (VI.2.10), although does not coincide with it. The function f (z) admits standard estimates f (z)  z min {(M - 1)z, 2}  2(M - 1)s z 1+s , 0  s  1 , allowing to prove the following result [Burnashev and Holevo 1997] Theorem 1.

On the other hand, it appears possible to apply in the quantum case the "expurgation" technique from [Gallager 1968], Sec. 5.7, resulting in the bound E(R)  max max(~(, s) - sR)  Eex (R), µ

The behavior of the lower bounds Er (R), Eex (R) can be studied by the methods of classical information theory, see [Burnashev and Holevo 1997]. In par¯ ticular, it follows easily that C  max µ (, 0) = C. Thus the rate C -  can be attained with the approximate maximum likelihood decision rule (5), (4) without projecting onto the typical subspace. We also remark that ¯2 µ(, 1) = µ(, 1) = - log TrS , ~ (15)

and that the common linear portion of the functions Er (R), Eex (R) is just µ(, 1) - R. III. General signal states with finite entropy The general case is substantially more complicated already on the level of quantum Bayes problem; in particular, so far no upper bound for the average error probability is known, generalizing appropriately the geometrically simple bound (6). The proof given in [Holevo 1996] is based rather on a noncommutative generalization of the idea of "jointly typical" sequences in classical theory [Cover and Thomas 1991]. This is realized by substituting in the average error probability (3) the decision rule

(18)

After substituting (16) into (3) and performing a number of rather laborious steps intended to get rid of the normalization factors in (16) and thus to obtain an expression in which the different words are "decoupled", one arrives at the estimate 1 ¯ min (W, X)  X M

for n large enough, hence by (11), (17) p(M, n)  4 + (M - 1)2-n[H()-2] ¯ implying C  C. Combined with the entropy bound, this gives Theorem 2. The capacity of the channel with H(Si ) <  is given by C = max[H(

For quasiclassical channel where the signal states are given by commuting density operators Si one can use the classical bound of Theorem 5.6.1 [Gallager 1968] with transition probabilities S(|i), where S(|i) are the eigenvalues of Si .

(21)

The righthand side of (21) is meaningful for arbitrary density operators, which gives a hope that this estimate could be generalized to the noncommutative case (note that for pure states Si Theorem 1 gives twice the expression (21)). This would not only give a different proof of Theorem 2, but also a lower bound for the quantum reliability function in the case of general signal states, eventually with infinite entropy. 9

IV. Quantum channels with constrained inputs In classical information theory direct coding theorems for channels with additive constraints are proved by using random coding with probability distribution (8) modified with a factor concentrated on words, for which the constraint holds close to the equality [Gallager 1968], Sec. 7.3. The same tool can be applied to quantum channels [Holevo 1997]. For definiteness in this section we take for the input alphabet A an arbitrary Borel subset in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space E. We assume that the channel is given by weakly continuous mapping x  Sx from the input alphabet A to the set of density operators in H. We assume that a continuous function f on E is fixed and consider the set P1 of probability measures  on A satisfying
A

f (x)(dx)  E.

(22)

For arbitrary   P1 consider the quantity ¯ H() = H(S ) - ¯ where S =

we denote

¯ C = sup H().

(25)

Let p(M, n) denote the infimum of the average error probability over all codes of size M with words w = (x1 , . . . , xn ) satisfying the additive constraint f (x1 ) + . . . + f (xn )  nE. (26)

Theorem 3. Under the condition (24) the capacity of the channel with ¯ the input constraint (26) is given by (25), i. e. p(en(C-) , n)  0 , and ¯ p(en(C+) , n)  0 for  > 0 as n  . The proof uses the inequality (19) with the random coding modified as described in [Gallager 1968], Sec. 7.3. The same method combined with the estimate (14) for pure state channels gives lower bound for the reliability function modified with the factor const ·er[f (x)-E] , with r  0. 10

Theorem 3, when applied to quantum memoryless Gaussian channels with the energy constraint [Holevo 1997], allows us to prove for the first time their asymptotic equivalence, in the sense of the information capacity, to the corresponding quasiclassical "photon channels", extensively studied from the origin of quantum communications [Gordon 1964], [Lebedev and Levitin 1966], [Caves and Drummond 1994]. It is plausible that the equivalence extends also to waveform channels, in particular , that the infinite-band photon channel capacity [Lebedev and Levitin 1966] 2 N +E - C= 3 h ¯ Y (t) = x(t) + Z(t);

is equal to the properly defined capacity of the quantum Gaussian channel t  [0, T ],

where x(t) is the classical signal subject to the energy constraint 0T x(t)2 dt  ET, and Z(t) is the equilibrium quantum Gaussian noise having the commutator   sin (t - s)d = -i¯   (t - s), h [Z(t), Z(s)] = i¯ h

V. Some further problems The present paper was entirely devoted to the "classical-quantum" channels, in terminology of [Holevo 1977]), and even in this case there are open problems, some of which were mentioned above. Such channels can alternatively be described by (completely) positive maps from noncommutative algebra of operators in H to commutative algebra of functions on the input alphabet. More general "quantum-quantum" channels are described by completely positive maps between noncommutative algebras. The definition of capacity and the quantum entropy bound can be generalized to this case [Holevo 1977], [Ohya and Petz 1993]. However for such channels the new difficult problem of optimization with respect to coding maps arises. In particular, it is not yet known, whether the entropy bound optimized in this way is an additive function on the product channel. An interesting preliminary investigation of this situation is contained in the paper by Bennett, Fuchs and Smolin [Bennett et al. 1996]. All these problems address transmission of classical information through quantum channels. There is yet "more quantum" domain of problems concerning reliable transmission of entire quantum states under a given fidelity criterion. The very definition of the relevant "quantum information" is far from obvious. Important steps in this direction were made by Barnum, Nielsen and Schumacher [Barnum et al. 1997] , who in particular suggested a tentative converse of the relevant coding theorem. However the proof of the corresponding direct theorem remains an open question.

Abstract

arXiv:quant-ph/9708047v1 27 Aug 1997

The scheme of Clauser and Dowling (Phys. Rev. A 53, 4587 (1996)) for factoring N by means of an N -slit interference experiment is translated into an experiment with a single Mach-Zehnder interferometer. With dispersive phase shifters the ratio of coherence length to wavelength limits the numbers that can be factored. A conservative estimate permits N  107 . It is furthermore shown, that sine and cosine Fourier coefficients of a real periodic function can be obtained with such an interferometer.

PACS: 03.65.Bz, 06.50.Mk, 07.60.Ly Recently Clauser and Dowling (CD) have shown that factors of an integer N can be determined by simply measuring the peaks of the intensity distribution on the screen behind a Young's N-slit arrangement [1]. This device is distinct from the currently much debated proposals for quantum computation, because it does not need the entanglement of several quantal degrees of freedom. Therefore it is very immune against decoherence and could readily be implemented with present technology. The drawback is that it will not exhibit the potential increase in computational power characteristic of entanglement. Nevertheless, the work of CD indicates that single particle interference arrangements have useful applications beyond physical measurements. The purpose of this note is to point out that the CD-proposal can be translated into an experiment with only a single Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This will enhance the flexibility of this calculational device. A further point is that a Mach-Zehnder interferomter can also perform other computations, in particular cosine and sine Fourier transformations. Let us first focus on the work of CD. This proposal shows, that in a suitably chosen central region on the detection screen behind an N-slit arrangement, all intensity peaks are equal if, and only if, the quantity n  R/a2 is a factor of N, where  is the wavelength of the incident radiation, a is the center-to-center distance of the slits, and R is the distance between the slits and the screen. Furthermore, the Fraunhofer limit is assumed (R  a  ). Different values of n can be tested by adjusting any of the parameters, for instance . The probability amplitude caused by slit i at a point r on the screen is given by i (r). The probability that the particle will hit this point is therefore

I(r) =
i=1

i (r) =

|i (r)|2 + 2

N  Re i (r)j (r) .

For the idea to be presented here, it is important to notice that the essential properties of I(r) can also be obtained in measurements with a series of different two-slit experiments. This is so, because quantum mechanical probabilities are the second power of probability

amplitudes. Therefore, the interference term of I(r), which is the double summation on the right hand side, only contains products made up of just two factors. And this feature is already present in the two-slit experiment. (This would not be the case, if, say, probabilities were the third power of probability amplitudes. Then the paradigm of quantum physics would only be fully contained in a three slit experiment.) The analytic behavior of the interference term of the N-slit experiment can therefore be recaptured, when adding the intensities of all permutations of two-slit experiments obtainable by covering N - 2 of the N slits. This procedure will not reproduce the behavior of the mean intensity. But we can neglect the mean intensity here, because it is only of statistical relevance. Instead of doing several two-slit experiments with different distances of the slits, it is of course more convenient to use a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and vary the phase shift. A further advantage of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is that it has only two outputs, instead of the continuum of a screen. Then, with an arrangement as shown in Fig.1, factoring can be achieved in the following way: The phase shift  is increased in discrete steps 2/n, such that j = 2j/n. For simplicity we assume that at each step one particle is sent into the interferometer. We look at the outputs only when j = kN, k = 1, 2, 3... . So at the k th observation the probability to register the particle at detector A is pA (k) = 1 2kN 1 + cos 2 n . (2)

We have pA (k) = 1 only if n is a factor of N. Suppose we perform n observations, starting with k = 1 until k = n. Then the sum of the particles registered in detector A will be n 1 n 2kN cos In = pA (k) = + 2 2 k=1 n k=1
n

.

(3)

For n a factor of N we have In = n, because then the phases in the cosine terms will all be multiples of 2. However, if n is not a factor, the cosine-terms of the summation will roughly cancel each other, and we will only have In  n/2. To see this more clearly, we write N/n = M + r, where M is the largest integer for which N/n > M, and r is the rational remainder, r = L/n, with L  [1, 2, ...., n - 1]. Then the summation over the cosine terms can be written as n 2L cos k . (4) n k=1 The phases of the cosines are now equidistantly spread in n steps from the value 2L/n, which is less than 2, to 2L, which is at most 2(n - 1), so that when reducing the phases to the interval [0, 2], this interval will be used quite evenly. For practical applications it is important to know what calculations are possible. Since the best interferometers today are operated with light, it is sufficient to look at the characteristics of such interferometers. If we implement the phase shift in the usual manner by increasing the path length difference of the two arms of the interferometer, the coherence length of the incident radiation sets the limit to the largest number N that can be factored. According to eq.(3) the maximum phase shift to be set in this scheme is 2N. Assuming a wavelength of  = 500nm and conservatively limiting the coherence length, given by C = 2 /, where  is the standard deviation of the wavelength distribution, to C = 5m, numbers up to N  107 can be factored. 2

One also wants to know how long a calculation will take. When testing whether n is a factor of N, one must set nN different phase shifts. Since the largest factor to be checked  is of the order of N , the longest check will take a time proportional to N 3/2 . A further consideration is the maximum deviation permissible in the phase increments 2/n, in order to ensure correct identification of the factors of N. Suppose the actual increment is 2/(n + d), where d is the deviation. In the ideal case we have d = 0, and when n is a factor of N the sum (3) yields an intensity of n. Now this sum will still be substantially larger than n/2 (which would indicate a non-factor), if the deviation d is such, that for the largest phase shift to be set (at k = n) we have 2N -  rather than the 2 ideal value 2N. Then the contribution of the last term of the sum is zero, whereas all the 1 1 others are still positive, so that the total intensity will be roughly n( 2 +  ). This limits the permissible relative deviation of the phase shift increments from their ideal value to d d  (4N)-1 . For our example of above this would mean n  2.5 × 10-8 . Such accuracy n can be achieved in optical interferometers, when the lengthening of one arm relative to the other is itself controlled interferometrically. It is also possible to implement a kind of parallel computation with a setup as illustrated in Fig.2. Here, the numbers n1 , n2 , ..., n7 can almost simultaneously be checked for being factors of N, thereby utilizing an incident particle for more than just one computation. The phase shifters in the various loops are simultaneously stepped up, but at the different increments 2/n1 , 2/n2 , ..., 2/n7 , respectively. Let us assume ni < nj for i < j. And for the sake of convenience we sum the intensity in a given detector as needed for testing for the largest of the possible factors of the loops involved. For instance, at detector A (and also at B) we would sum until k = n4 , thus IA = 1 2kN 1 + cos n1 k=1 8

The expectation values for IA , IB and IC +ID (the latter also just summed up to n4 ) for the various possibilities are shown in Table I. Clearly, the results permit unique identification of the eight possible answers of interest. Table I. Dependance of intensities on property of "factor" or "non-factor". Factors are indicated by "F", non-factors by "-".

The situation is a little bit more complicated for the interferometer loops following the lower arm of the n1 -interferometer. We must account for the possibility that n1 is a factor of N. If we then measured the intensity at any of the detectors E to H after every N 3

phase increments, we would never detect a particle. Therefore it is necessary to start the loops on the lower arm of n1 with a delay of around n1 /2 increments. Similar arguments apply to any of the interferometers connected to an output which is dark when the phase shift is a multiple of 2. For instance, testing whether n3 and n6 are factors of N requires that one waits for about (n1 + n3 )/2 increments, and from then on sums the intensities at E (or at F ) after every N further increments. Then the expectation values for IE for the eight possibilities (i.e., which of n1 , n3 , n6 is a factor of N) are analogous to those shown for IA in Table I. However, the offset relative to the total number of phase increments to be gone through is small, such that one can still speak of essentially parallel computation. But, of course, as this is a device not exploiting the entanglement of quantum systems, the number of loops, or the total amount of time, needed for factoring N rises polynomially with N, rather than just logarithmically. Let us now turn to how Fourier transformations can be performed by means of an interferometer. Specifically, it is possible to obtain the cosine and sine Fourier coefficients of a real valued positive function f (t), which is periodic with the period  , and where t denotes time. For this it is necessary that the intensity incident on the interferometer varies in time proportional to f (t), and that the phase shift  applied between the two paths of the interferometer increases linearly with time, e.g. (t) = 2mt ,  (6)

where m is an integer. In order to avoid problems of the change of energy of the particles when experiencing a time-dependent phase shift, we limit ourselves to slow rates, m/  E/h, where E is the energy of the particles and h is Planck's constant. Then the difference of the intensities at detectors A and B integrated over one period  is IA - IB = c
 0

f (t) cos

2mt dt, 

(7)

where c is the proportionality constant between f (t) and the incident intensity. As can be seen, IA - IB is proportional to the mth cosine Fourier coefficient of f (t). In order to obtain the sine Fourier coefficients, one only needs to add a constant phase shift of -/2 to (t). Note that this calculational procedure is different from the experimental method employed in Fourier spectroscopy, which has been used in astronomy since the days of Michelson and which has recently also been used in electron [2] and neutron [3] interferometry. In Fourier spectroscopy one can measure the spectral distribution of the incident radiation, if this distribution is symmetric about the mean, but one gets no phase information.

And this feature is already present in the two-slit experiment. (This would not be the case, if, say, probabilities were the third power of probability amplitudes.

A further advantage of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is that it has only two outputs, instead of the continuum of a screen. Then, with an arrangement as shown in Fig.1, factoring can be achieved in the following way: The phase shift  is increased in discrete steps 2/n, such that j = 2j/n. For simplicity we assume that at each step one particle is sent into the interferometer. We look at the outputs only when j = kN, k = 1, 2, 3... . So at the k th observation the probability to register the particle at detector A is pA (k) = 1 2kN 1 + cos 2 n . (2)

We have pA (k) = 1 only if n is a factor of N. Suppose we perform n observations, starting with k = 1 until k = n. Then the sum of the particles registered in detector A will be n 1 n 2kN cos In = pA (k) = + 2 2 k=1 n k=1

For n a factor of N we have In = n, because then the phases in the cosine terms will all be multiples of 2. However, if n is not a factor, the cosine-terms of the summation will roughly cancel each other, and we will only have In  n/2. To see this more clearly, we write N/n = M + r, where M is the largest integer for which N/n > M, and r is the rational remainder, r = L/n, with L  [1, 2, ...., n - 1]. Then the summation over the cosine terms can be written as n 2L cos k . (4) n k=1 The phases of the cosines are now equidistantly spread in n steps from the value 2L/n, which is less than 2, to 2L, which is at most 2(n - 1), so that when reducing the phases to the interval [0, 2], this interval will be used quite evenly. For practical applications it is important to know what calculations are possible. Since the best interferometers today are operated with light, it is sufficient to look at the characteristics of such interferometers. If we implement the phase shift in the usual manner by increasing the path length difference of the two arms of the interferometer, the coherence length of the incident radiation sets the limit to the largest number N that can be factored. According to eq.(3) the maximum phase shift to be set in this scheme is 2N. Assuming a wavelength of  = 500nm and conservatively limiting the coherence length, given by C = 2 /, where  is the standard deviation of the wavelength distribution, to C = 5m, numbers up to N  107 can be factored. 2

One also wants to know how long a calculation will take. When testing whether n is a factor of N, one must set nN different phase shifts. Since the largest factor to be checked  is of the order of N , the longest check will take a time proportional to N 3/2 . A further consideration is the maximum deviation permissible in the phase increments 2/n, in order to ensure correct identification of the factors of N. Suppose the actual increment is 2/(n + d), where d is the deviation. In the ideal case we have d = 0, and when n is a factor of N the sum (3) yields an intensity of n. Now this sum will still be substantially larger than n/2 (which would indicate a non-factor), if the deviation d is such, that for the largest phase shift to be set (at k = n) we have 2N -  rather than the 2 ideal value 2N. Then the contribution of the last term of the sum is zero, whereas all the 1 1 others are still positive, so that the total intensity will be roughly n( 2 +  ). This limits the permissible relative deviation of the phase shift increments from their ideal value to d d  (4N)-1 . For our example of above this would mean n  2.5 × 10-8 . Such accuracy n can be achieved in optical interferometers, when the lengthening of one arm relative to the other is itself controlled interferometrically. It is also possible to implement a kind of parallel computation with a setup as illustrated in Fig.2. Here, the numbers n1 , n2 , ..., n7 can almost simultaneously be checked for being factors of N, thereby utilizing an incident particle for more than just one computation. The phase shifters in the various loops are simultaneously stepped up, but at the different increments 2/n1 , 2/n2 , ..., 2/n7 , respectively. Let us assume ni < nj for i < j. And for the sake of convenience we sum the intensity in a given detector as needed for testing for the largest of the possible factors of the loops involved. For instance, at detector A (and also at B) we would sum until k = n4 , thus IA = 1 2kN 1 + cos n1 k=1 8

The expectation values for IA , IB and IC +ID (the latter also just summed up to n4 ) for the various possibilities are shown in Table I. Clearly, the results permit unique identification of the eight possible answers of interest. Table I. Dependance of intensities on property of "factor" or "non-factor".

The situation is a little bit more complicated for the interferometer loops following the lower arm of the n1 -interferometer. We must account for the possibility that n1 is a factor of N. If we then measured the intensity at any of the detectors E to H after every N 3

phase increments, we would never detect a particle. Therefore it is necessary to start the loops on the lower arm of n1 with a delay of around n1 /2 increments. Similar arguments apply to any of the interferometers connected to an output which is dark when the phase shift is a multiple of 2. For instance, testing whether n3 and n6 are factors of N requires that one waits for about (n1 + n3 )/2 increments, and from then on sums the intensities at E (or at F ) after every N further increments. Then the expectation values for IE for the eight possibilities (i.e., which of n1 , n3 , n6 is a factor of N) are analogous to those shown for IA in Table I. However, the offset relative to the total number of phase increments to be gone through is small, such that one can still speak of essentially parallel computation. But, of course, as this is a device not exploiting the entanglement of quantum systems, the number of loops, or the total amount of time, needed for factoring N rises polynomially with N, rather than just logarithmically. Let us now turn to how Fourier transformations can be performed by means of an interferometer. Specifically, it is possible to obtain the cosine and sine Fourier coefficients of a real valued positive function f (t), which is periodic with the period  , and where t denotes time. For this it is necessary that the intensity incident on the interferometer varies in time proportional to f (t), and that the phase shift  applied between the two paths of the interferometer increases linearly with time, e.g. (t) = 2mt ,  (6)

where m is an integer. In order to avoid problems of the change of energy of the particles when experiencing a time-dependent phase shift, we limit ourselves to slow rates, m/  E/h, where E is the energy of the particles and h is Planck's constant. Then the difference of the intensities at detectors A and B integrated over one period  is IA - IB = c
 0

where c is the proportionality constant between f (t) and the incident intensity. As can be seen, IA - IB is proportional to the mth cosine Fourier coefficient of f (t). In order to obtain the sine Fourier coefficients, one only needs to add a constant phase shift of -/2 to (t). Note that this calculational procedure is different from the experimental method employed in Fourier spectroscopy, which has been used in astronomy since the days of Michelson and which has recently also been used in electron [2] and neutron [3] interferometry. In Fourier spectroscopy one can measure the spectral distribution of the incident radiation, if this distribution is symmetric about the mean, but one gets no phase information.

Introduction

In classical mechanics the interaction between a measuring device and the object is treated as arbitrarily small and can therefore be neglected. This is fundamentally different in quantum physics, as examplified in the Heisenberg-microscope: A measurement of the position of an electron inevitably leads to a disturbance of its momentum by the scattering of a photon. It seems that no measurement can be performed without the interaction with a particle. Even in the case investigated by Dicke [1], where knowledge about the position of an atom is gained by ascertaining where it is not, it had to be concluded, that photon scattering still is responsible for providing the information. However, the scattering remains unresolvable, because the change in the photon's momentum is within the momentum uncertainty of the illuminating beam of light. But recently Elitzur and Vaidman (EV) proposed an experiment where the presence of a perfectly absorbing classical object in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be detected [2], [3], [4], [5]. EV symbolized the object by a bomb which explodes when the measuring particle hits it. Their scheme is shown in Fig.1. Here, no interaction is involved. For, had there been an interaction, the test particle would have been absorbed and could not have reached any of the detectors at the outputs of the interferometer. The drawback of this scheme is that even when adjusting the transmissivity of the beam splitters of the interferometer, the probability of recognizing the object without interaction does not exceed 50%. This disadvantage could be overcome by Zeilinger et al., who introduced a multi-loop interferometer. In the limit of infinitely many loops, one can obtain a probability of 100% of determining the presence of the absorbing object without interaction [6]. Paul and Pavicic incorporated this idea into a proposal employing an optical resonator [7]. A first experiment with polarized photons has already been reported [8], [9].

50% of interaction-free detections of the object were possible. The theoretical analysis of these situations has also been extended to absorbing quantum objects, where it is no longer possible to assume a perfect absorber. But even then, a sizable amount of knowledge is gained without interaction [10], [11]. In this paper we report on the first experiment with neutrons. The original scheme of EV was implemented in a single crystal neutron interferometer. Although such interferometers are not ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometers, it was possible to ascertain the presence of an absorbing object, which was realized as a neutron detector, with higher probability than classical physics would permit, so that one must conclude that some knowledge is obtained without interaction. Before dealing with the details of this experiment, it is useful to recall the ideal case of EV (Fig.1). The two interferometric paths have equal length and the beam splitters at the entrance and at the exit have the same reflectivity of 50%. When the interferometer is empty the probability amplitudes leading to P1 interfere constructively, while those leading to P2 interfere destructively. Therefore a particle will always be directed towards P1 (Fig.1a). If a perfectly absorbing object -- from now on called a black object -- is inserted into one path of the interferometer, only one beam can reach the exit ports, because the wavefunction behind the object vanishes. No interference can occur. With semitransparent mirrors at the entrance and exit of the interferometer, there is a probability of 50% that the particle will be absorbed in the object, and a probability of 25% each that it will reach either P1 or P2. In order to clarify why interaction-free measurement is involved here, consider a collection of identically looking objects, some perfectly absorbing, some perfectly transparent (i.e. not even inducing a phase shift) for the kind of particles used in the interferometer. Will it be possible to separate the objects into the two classes when testing them in the interferometer? Classically there is no way. Without permitting interaction we could only randomly pick out objects and put them into the one or the other class. But quantum mechanically a separation is possible. This is illustrated in Fig.2. Suppose we place one such object, of which it is not known whether it is black or transparent, into one path of the interferometer and send one particle. Three different outcomes can occur: i. The particle is detected at port P1. This can happen in either case, so no information is gained and another particle may be used. ii. The particle is detected at port P2. This is impossible with a perfectly transparent object, so we know now, that a black object is in the interferometer. Only one particle entered the interferometer and it was not absorbed, but was detected at P2. So it cannot have interacted with the object, and we got information of the absorbing property of the object without interaction. iii. The particle is detected neither at P1 nor at P2. Here we conclude, that the particle was absorbed by a black object, which, clearly, involved an interaction. The result in ii is a nice example of the wave-particle-duality. The wave description determines the probabilities of the detection at the ports P1 and P2 by interference of the wavefunctions of the two paths. The particle description lets us conclude, that the particle did not interact with the black object when it was detected at P2: If it had been at the site of the black object, it would have been caught there, and could not have reached P2. 2

The three outcomes permit putting the tested objects into three groups as sketched in Fig.2. Groups ii and iii will only contain black objects. All transparent objects are accumulated in group i, but also some black objects, because in a single test the probability for a transparent object to be placed there is 100%, while for a black object it is 25%. With repeated tests of the objects of this group, the probability of still having a black object there will approach zero. Simultaneously, the number of objects in group ii will reach one third of the originally available black objects. Two thirds of the black objects will end up in group iii, because they interacted with the test particle and absorbed it. The purpose of the present experiment was to perform such a selection procedure with a real neutron interferometer. The black objects were realized as a neutron detector. In this manner the three possible outcomes of an individual test could be observed. For transparent objects the interferometric paths were left empty.

Experiment and Results

The experiment was performed with the perfect-silicon-crystal neutron interferometer installed at the north beam port of the 250kW TRIGA MARK II reactor of the Atominstitut. This interferometer separates the paths by about 4 cm and recombines them again. The action of semitransparent mirrors is accomplished through Bragg-diffraction in Laue geometry at the 220-planes of the four crystal slabs. As can be seen in Fig.3, the basic layout is similar to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and therefore well suited to test the EV-scheme. The main difference to the ideal case is that the two output beams are not equivalent. Output beam 1 can have a contrast of 100% (i.e. be fully modulated), but output beam 2 cannot [12], because the number of reflections and transmissions at the crystal slabs is not the same for the two paths making up output beam 2. But due to crystal imperfections, even output beam 1 never reaches a contrast of 100%. A contrast of 40% is obtained with a cross section of 4 mm (width) times 7 mm (height) of the incident beam, and a wavelength of  = 1.8° with a spread of /  1%. When normalizing A the average intensity at output 1 to 1, the intensities of our set up are, as a function of a phase shift  between paths I and II (setup as shown in Fig.3, but without the Cd sheet and without an object in path I): I1 () = 1 + 0.4 cos() and There is no phase shift  at which one of the output beams is completely dark. This is contrary to the crucial assumption in the EV scheme. Consequently, a statement of the sort "if a neutron is detected at P2, a black object is with certainty in one of the arms of the intereferometer" was no longer possible. Nevertheless each test had to lead to a decision into which group the tested object should be put. We kept the three groups outlined above. But the certain identification of black objects had to be replaced by a probabilistic one, and it was attempted to achieve an enrichment of transparent objects in one group and of black objects in the two other groups. For this purpose theoretical simulations were undertaken, using the performance characteristics of the actual interferometer [13]. The questions to be answered were, whether the probability of successful interaction-free identification of black objects could be increased by 3 I2 () = 1.7 - 0.4 cos(). (2) (1)

(a) attenuating the intensity of beam I, into which the test objects were to be placed, with an additional partial absorber, and (b) introducing an additional constant phase shift of , such that a registration of a neutron at P1 rather than at P2 could be taken to indicate the presence of a black object. It turned out that the optimal conditions could be obtained when attenuating beam I to t = 16% of its original intensity. This would reduce the amplitude of the intensity  oscillations at P1 and P2 as a function of  by a factor t = 0.40. The attenuation was done with a Cd-sheet of 125µm thickness, which was placed in front of the second crystal slab, and parallel to this slab, as shown in Fig.3. The actual transmittance of this sheet was 0.158(4). The simulation also showed, that the phase shift between beams I and II should remain zero, just as in the EV-scheme, such that the count rate at P1 is at the maximum when a transparent object, or none, is present at the test position. But this, still, made it necessary to set the aluminum phase shifter to a certain value, because contrary to the ideal case, the actual interferometer has an internal phase offset due to inaccuracies of slab thicknesses and distances. In the experiment the registration of a neutron at P1 was interpreted as the presence of a transparent object, while registration at P2 was taken to indicate a black object. The probabilities of the possible results were determined by measuring the intensities of the neutron beams at the detectors P1 and P2, and, when applicable, at the detector D, which constituted the black object. The measured intensities of a typical run are listed in Table 1 below. Averaging over several runs was not done, because they showed different contrast, depending on the vibrational level of the building. A run lasted for approximately four hours, during which measurements with and without the black object in path I, as well as background measurements and normal interference scan measurements had to be taken [14]. Without any object in the paths, but with the attenuating Cd-sheet in place (Fig.3), the total intensity of P1 plus P2, including background, was 1.25 counts/sec. Table 1: Observed neutron counts with transparent (=none) or black object in the test position. detector P1 P2 D transparent object black object 3561 2073 793 999 -- 2253 background 215 59 1422

The background was determined by rotating the interferometer crystal around the vertical axis away from the Bragg condition by some 3 degrees, such that the incident neutron beam went straight through the first and second crystal slabs. The background at D is due to its position close to the incident beam, whose intensity is three orders of magnitude larger than the intensity which the Bragg condition selects for the interferometer. The background at D is in part also due to the gamma radiation which is created when neutrons are absorbed in the Cd sheet in a nuclear reaction. The detectors P1 and P2 were standard BF3 -filled (atmospheric pressure) cylindrical neutron detectors with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of around 40 cm, and were hit axially by the respective beams. Their efficiencies exceeded 97%. The detector D, representing the black object, 4

had an efficiency of only 65%. Its outside diameter was 2.54 cm, and its length some 30 cm. When at the test position, beam I hit it perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. It was filled with four atmospheres of He3 . The capture cross section of a thermal neutron at a He3 nucleus is 5330 barns. This results in a probability of 0.76 that a neutron will be captured in the gas. The reduction to 0.65 is due to averaging over the beam cross section and to electronic discrimination, which was needed to suppress as much as possible the unwanted gamma-background. If the neutron went through detector D unaffected, it was certainly absorbed by the shielding material behind the detector. Thereby it was ensured, that the black object really was black. From the data in table 1 it is possible to infer whether an actual interaction-free identification of black objects is possible. In so doing we will assume 100% efficiency of detectors P1 and P2. Since this is not very different from their actual efficiency the resulting error will be small. Detector D of the black object is not needed for the analysis. This detector only served for a check of the consistency of the results. After subtracting the background counts, which is permissible, because they can in principle be made arbitrarily low with improved shielding and electronics, the probabilities for an object to be put into one of the three groups after a test with only a single particle, can be calculated as given in table 2: Table 2: Probabilities of detection of neutron at one of the detectors with black or transparent object in test position. Standard deviations include only Poisson statistics of the counts of table 1. Numbers in rectangular brackets are probabilities for ideal MachZehnder interferometer. object black transparent detection at P1 (i) .455±.014 [.25] .820±.020 [1] detection at P2 (ii) .231±.009 [.25] .180±.008 [0] absorption in object (iii) .314pm.018 [.50] --

It is noteworthy, that the probability that the neutron gets absorbed in the black object is significantly lower than in an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This improved performance is also retained in the limit of infinitely many tests of the objects remaining in group i. In such a procedure, the probability for a black object not to interact with the neutron and ultimately to be put into group ii is given by

where we have inserted from table 2, pblack = .455 and pblack = .231. Correspondingly, the probability that the black object ultimately absorbs a particle in this procedure and thus is put into group iii is 1 - .424 = .576. But, unfortunately, in such repeated tests the transparent objects, too, will accumulate in group ii. The reason is, that their probability (i) of being put into group i in a single test is less than 1, namely ptrans = .820, according to table 2. Therefore, when testing objects in group i again and again, until either P1 or D fires, all transparent objects and 42.4% of the black objects will end up in group ii. A closer analysis reveals, that with our real neutron interferometer, the best separation of black and transparent objects is obtained when testing each object only once. Then one can obtain a separation as shown in Fig.4. The x-axis represents the fraction of black objects in the original ensemble. The full curves going from the lower left to the 5

upper right corner represent the fraction of black objects ending up in group ii, which is the group where the tested object is put when the particle is detected at P2. The thick line is the most likely value, the two thin ones delimit its standard deviation. The dashed line indicates "no separation" of black and transparent objects. One notes that an enrichment of black objects in group ii does happen, because their fraction there is always larger than their fraction in the original ensemble. For instance, for a fraction of .5 of black objects in the original ensemble, their fraction in the final ensemble ii will be .562±.014. Therefore, even with a neutron interferometer, whose performance is far from an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and in fact far from the best available neutron interferometers, some information is obtained in an interaction-free manner. For the sake of completeness Fig.4 also shows the fraction of transparent objects in group i after a single test. These are the curves extending from the upper left to the lower right corner. As expected, transparent objects are accumulated in group i. It is also interesting to ask whether for the real neutron interferometer there exists a method, different from the EV-method, which permits arbitrarily good separation of transparent and black objects. This is indeed possible, albeit at the cost of only a tiny fraction of the originally available black objects remaining. The method consists in repeated tests (ii) (ii) of the objects in group ii. As before, let pblack and ptrans denote the probabilities that a black, respectively transparent, object will be put into group ii after a single test. Ac(ii) cording to table 2 we have, again neglecting experimental uncertainties, pblack = .231 and (ii) ptrans = .180. When testing objects of group ii a further N - 1 times, a black object of N (ii) (ii) the original ensemble is therefore pblack /ptrans = (1.283)N times more likely to remain in group ii as compared to a transparent object of the original ensemble. Arbitrarily good purification of group ii is therefore possible without interaction. The number of black N (ii) objects group ii contains in the end, will however only be pblack times the number of black objects in the original ensemble.

Conclusion

We have performed a test of interaction-free measurement with a neutron interferometer of the Mach-Zehnder type. In the unobstructed interferometer the probability of a neutron to be found in the path of the test position for the black and the transparent objects to be identified was around .3, and correspondingly the probability to find it in the other path was around .7. The visibility contrast at the exit port P1 only reached around 40%. With such strong deviations from the characteristics of an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer it was nevertheless possible to show that an original ensemble with unknown proportions of black and transparent objects can be separated into two groups by testing each object with essentially only one neutron (about 1.04 neutrons on average), which must not be absorbed in the test object. Then one of these groups is guaranteed to contain a higher proportion of black objects than the original ensemble. The black objects are laid out as a neutron detector plus absorptive shielding. A neutron interacting with a black object would certainly be absorbed by it. Therefore, the result shows interaction-free measurement at work.

Introduction

In classical mechanics the interaction between a measuring device and the object is treated as arbitrarily small and can therefore be neglected. This is fundamentally different in quantum physics, as examplified in the Heisenberg-microscope: A measurement of the position of an electron inevitably leads to a disturbance of its momentum by the scattering of a photon. It seems that no measurement can be performed without the interaction with a particle. Even in the case investigated by Dicke [1], where knowledge about the position of an atom is gained by ascertaining where it is not, it had to be concluded, that photon scattering still is responsible for providing the information. However, the scattering remains unresolvable, because the change in the photon's momentum is within the momentum uncertainty of the illuminating beam of light. But recently Elitzur and Vaidman (EV) proposed an experiment where the presence of a perfectly absorbing classical object in one arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer can be detected [2], [3], [4], [5]. EV symbolized the object by a bomb which explodes when the measuring particle hits it. Their scheme is shown in Fig.1. Here, no interaction is involved. For, had there been an interaction, the test particle would have been absorbed and could not have reached any of the detectors at the outputs of the interferometer. The drawback of this scheme is that even when adjusting the transmissivity of the beam splitters of the interferometer, the probability of recognizing the object without interaction does not exceed 50%. This disadvantage could be overcome by Zeilinger et al., who introduced a multi-loop interferometer. In the limit of infinitely many loops, one can obtain a probability of 100% of determining the presence of the absorbing object without interaction [6]. Paul and Pavicic incorporated this idea into a proposal employing an optical resonator [7]. A first experiment with polarized photons has already been reported [8], [9].

50% of interaction-free detections of the object were possible. The theoretical analysis of these situations has also been extended to absorbing quantum objects, where it is no longer possible to assume a perfect absorber. But even then, a sizable amount of knowledge is gained without interaction [10], [11]. In this paper we report on the first experiment with neutrons. The original scheme of EV was implemented in a single crystal neutron interferometer. Although such interferometers are not ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometers, it was possible to ascertain the presence of an absorbing object, which was realized as a neutron detector, with higher probability than classical physics would permit, so that one must conclude that some knowledge is obtained without interaction. Before dealing with the details of this experiment, it is useful to recall the ideal case of EV (Fig.1). The two interferometric paths have equal length and the beam splitters at the entrance and at the exit have the same reflectivity of 50%. When the interferometer is empty the probability amplitudes leading to P1 interfere constructively, while those leading to P2 interfere destructively. Therefore a particle will always be directed towards P1 (Fig.1a). If a perfectly absorbing object -- from now on called a black object -- is inserted into one path of the interferometer, only one beam can reach the exit ports, because the wavefunction behind the object vanishes. No interference can occur. With semitransparent mirrors at the entrance and exit of the interferometer, there is a probability of 50% that the particle will be absorbed in the object, and a probability of 25% each that it will reach either P1 or P2. In order to clarify why interaction-free measurement is involved here, consider a collection of identically looking objects, some perfectly absorbing, some perfectly transparent (i.e. not even inducing a phase shift) for the kind of particles used in the interferometer. Will it be possible to separate the objects into the two classes when testing them in the interferometer? Classically there is no way. Without permitting interaction we could only randomly pick out objects and put them into the one or the other class. But quantum mechanically a separation is possible. This is illustrated in Fig.2. Suppose we place one such object, of which it is not known whether it is black or transparent, into one path of the interferometer and send one particle. Three different outcomes can occur: i. The particle is detected at port P1. This can happen in either case, so no information is gained and another particle may be used. ii. The particle is detected at port P2. This is impossible with a perfectly transparent object, so we know now, that a black object is in the interferometer. Only one particle entered the interferometer and it was not absorbed, but was detected at P2. So it cannot have interacted with the object, and we got information of the absorbing property of the object without interaction. iii. The particle is detected neither at P1 nor at P2. Here we conclude, that the particle was absorbed by a black object, which, clearly, involved an interaction. The result in ii is a nice example of the wave-particle-duality. The wave description determines the probabilities of the detection at the ports P1 and P2 by interference of the wavefunctions of the two paths. The particle description lets us conclude, that the particle did not interact with the black object when it was detected at P2: If it had been at the site of the black object, it would have been caught there, and could not have reached P2. 2

The three outcomes permit putting the tested objects into three groups as sketched in Fig.2. Groups ii and iii will only contain black objects. All transparent objects are accumulated in group i, but also some black objects, because in a single test the probability for a transparent object to be placed there is 100%, while for a black object it is 25%. With repeated tests of the objects of this group, the probability of still having a black object there will approach zero. Simultaneously, the number of objects in group ii will reach one third of the originally available black objects. Two thirds of the black objects will end up in group iii, because they interacted with the test particle and absorbed it. The purpose of the present experiment was to perform such a selection procedure with a real neutron interferometer. The black objects were realized as a neutron detector. In this manner the three possible outcomes of an individual test could be observed. For transparent objects the interferometric paths were left empty.

Experiment and Results

The experiment was performed with the perfect-silicon-crystal neutron interferometer installed at the north beam port of the 250kW TRIGA MARK II reactor of the Atominstitut. This interferometer separates the paths by about 4 cm and recombines them again. The action of semitransparent mirrors is accomplished through Bragg-diffraction in Laue geometry at the 220-planes of the four crystal slabs. As can be seen in Fig.3, the basic layout is similar to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and therefore well suited to test the EV-scheme. The main difference to the ideal case is that the two output beams are not equivalent. Output beam 1 can have a contrast of 100% (i.e. be fully modulated), but output beam 2 cannot [12], because the number of reflections and transmissions at the crystal slabs is not the same for the two paths making up output beam 2. But due to crystal imperfections, even output beam 1 never reaches a contrast of 100%. A contrast of 40% is obtained with a cross section of 4 mm (width) times 7 mm (height) of the incident beam, and a wavelength of  = 1.8° with a spread of /  1%. When normalizing A the average intensity at output 1 to 1, the intensities of our set up are, as a function of a phase shift  between paths I and II (setup as shown in Fig.3, but without the Cd sheet and without an object in path I): I1 () = 1 + 0.4 cos() and There is no phase shift  at which one of the output beams is completely dark. This is contrary to the crucial assumption in the EV scheme. Consequently, a statement of the sort "if a neutron is detected at P2, a black object is with certainty in one of the arms of the intereferometer" was no longer possible. Nevertheless each test had to lead to a decision into which group the tested object should be put. We kept the three groups outlined above. But the certain identification of black objects had to be replaced by a probabilistic one, and it was attempted to achieve an enrichment of transparent objects in one group and of black objects in the two other groups. For this purpose theoretical simulations were undertaken, using the performance characteristics of the actual interferometer [13]. The questions to be answered were, whether the probability of successful interaction-free identification of black objects could be increased by 3 I2 () = 1.7 - 0.4 cos(). (2) (1)

(a) attenuating the intensity of beam I, into which the test objects were to be placed, with an additional partial absorber, and (b) introducing an additional constant phase shift of , such that a registration of a neutron at P1 rather than at P2 could be taken to indicate the presence of a black object. It turned out that the optimal conditions could be obtained when attenuating beam I to t = 16% of its original intensity. This would reduce the amplitude of the intensity  oscillations at P1 and P2 as a function of  by a factor t = 0.40. The attenuation was done with a Cd-sheet of 125µm thickness, which was placed in front of the second crystal slab, and parallel to this slab, as shown in Fig.3. The actual transmittance of this sheet was 0.158(4). The simulation also showed, that the phase shift between beams I and II should remain zero, just as in the EV-scheme, such that the count rate at P1 is at the maximum when a transparent object, or none, is present at the test position. But this, still, made it necessary to set the aluminum phase shifter to a certain value, because contrary to the ideal case, the actual interferometer has an internal phase offset due to inaccuracies of slab thicknesses and distances. In the experiment the registration of a neutron at P1 was interpreted as the presence of a transparent object, while registration at P2 was taken to indicate a black object. The probabilities of the possible results were determined by measuring the intensities of the neutron beams at the detectors P1 and P2, and, when applicable, at the detector D, which constituted the black object. The measured intensities of a typical run are listed in Table 1 below. Averaging over several runs was not done, because they showed different contrast, depending on the vibrational level of the building. A run lasted for approximately four hours, during which measurements with and without the black object in path I, as well as background measurements and normal interference scan measurements had to be taken [14]. Without any object in the paths, but with the attenuating Cd-sheet in place (Fig.3), the total intensity of P1 plus P2, including background, was 1.25 counts/sec. Table 1: Observed neutron counts with transparent (=none) or black object in the test position. detector P1 P2 D transparent object black object 3561 2073 793 999 -- 2253 background 215 59 1422

The background was determined by rotating the interferometer crystal around the vertical axis away from the Bragg condition by some 3 degrees, such that the incident neutron beam went straight through the first and second crystal slabs. The background at D is due to its position close to the incident beam, whose intensity is three orders of magnitude larger than the intensity which the Bragg condition selects for the interferometer. The background at D is in part also due to the gamma radiation which is created when neutrons are absorbed in the Cd sheet in a nuclear reaction. The detectors P1 and P2 were standard BF3 -filled (atmospheric pressure) cylindrical neutron detectors with a diameter of 5 cm and a length of around 40 cm, and were hit axially by the respective beams. Their efficiencies exceeded 97%. The detector D, representing the black object, 4

had an efficiency of only 65%. Its outside diameter was 2.54 cm, and its length some 30 cm. When at the test position, beam I hit it perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. It was filled with four atmospheres of He3 . The capture cross section of a thermal neutron at a He3 nucleus is 5330 barns. This results in a probability of 0.76 that a neutron will be captured in the gas. The reduction to 0.65 is due to averaging over the beam cross section and to electronic discrimination, which was needed to suppress as much as possible the unwanted gamma-background. If the neutron went through detector D unaffected, it was certainly absorbed by the shielding material behind the detector. Thereby it was ensured, that the black object really was black. From the data in table 1 it is possible to infer whether an actual interaction-free identification of black objects is possible. In so doing we will assume 100% efficiency of detectors P1 and P2. Since this is not very different from their actual efficiency the resulting error will be small. Detector D of the black object is not needed for the analysis. This detector only served for a check of the consistency of the results. After subtracting the background counts, which is permissible, because they can in principle be made arbitrarily low with improved shielding and electronics, the probabilities for an object to be put into one of the three groups after a test with only a single particle, can be calculated as given in table 2: Table 2: Probabilities of detection of neutron at one of the detectors with black or transparent object in test position. Standard deviations include only Poisson statistics of the counts of table 1. Numbers in rectangular brackets are probabilities for ideal MachZehnder interferometer. object black transparent detection at P1 (i) .455±.014 [.25] .820±.020 [1] detection at P2 (ii) .231±.009 [.25] .180±.008 [0] absorption in object (iii) .314pm.018 [.50] --

It is noteworthy, that the probability that the neutron gets absorbed in the black object is significantly lower than in an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer. This improved performance is also retained in the limit of infinitely many tests of the objects remaining in group i. In such a procedure, the probability for a black object not to interact with the neutron and ultimately to be put into group ii is given by

where we have inserted from table 2, pblack = .455 and pblack = .231. Correspondingly, the probability that the black object ultimately absorbs a particle in this procedure and thus is put into group iii is 1 - .424 = .576. But, unfortunately, in such repeated tests the transparent objects, too, will accumulate in group ii. The reason is, that their probability (i) of being put into group i in a single test is less than 1, namely ptrans = .820, according to table 2. Therefore, when testing objects in group i again and again, until either P1 or D fires, all transparent objects and 42.4% of the black objects will end up in group ii. A closer analysis reveals, that with our real neutron interferometer, the best separation of black and transparent objects is obtained when testing each object only once. Then one can obtain a separation as shown in Fig.4. The x-axis represents the fraction of black objects in the original ensemble. The full curves going from the lower left to the 5

upper right corner represent the fraction of black objects ending up in group ii, which is the group where the tested object is put when the particle is detected at P2. The thick line is the most likely value, the two thin ones delimit its standard deviation. The dashed line indicates "no separation" of black and transparent objects. One notes that an enrichment of black objects in group ii does happen, because their fraction there is always larger than their fraction in the original ensemble. For instance, for a fraction of .5 of black objects in the original ensemble, their fraction in the final ensemble ii will be .562±.014. Therefore, even with a neutron interferometer, whose performance is far from an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and in fact far from the best available neutron interferometers, some information is obtained in an interaction-free manner. For the sake of completeness Fig.4 also shows the fraction of transparent objects in group i after a single test. These are the curves extending from the upper left to the lower right corner. As expected, transparent objects are accumulated in group i. It is also interesting to ask whether for the real neutron interferometer there exists a method, different from the EV-method, which permits arbitrarily good separation of transparent and black objects. This is indeed possible, albeit at the cost of only a tiny fraction of the originally available black objects remaining. The method consists in repeated tests (ii) (ii) of the objects in group ii. As before, let pblack and ptrans denote the probabilities that a black, respectively transparent, object will be put into group ii after a single test. Ac(ii) cording to table 2 we have, again neglecting experimental uncertainties, pblack = .231 and (ii) ptrans = .180. When testing objects of group ii a further N - 1 times, a black object of N (ii) (ii) the original ensemble is therefore pblack /ptrans = (1.283)N times more likely to remain in group ii as compared to a transparent object of the original ensemble. Arbitrarily good purification of group ii is therefore possible without interaction. The number of black N (ii) objects group ii contains in the end, will however only be pblack times the number of black objects in the original ensemble.

Conclusion

We have performed a test of interaction-free measurement with a neutron interferometer of the Mach-Zehnder type. In the unobstructed interferometer the probability of a neutron to be found in the path of the test position for the black and the transparent objects to be identified was around .3, and correspondingly the probability to find it in the other path was around .7. The visibility contrast at the exit port P1 only reached around 40%. With such strong deviations from the characteristics of an ideal Mach-Zehnder interferometer it was nevertheless possible to show that an original ensemble with unknown proportions of black and transparent objects can be separated into two groups by testing each object with essentially only one neutron (about 1.04 neutrons on average), which must not be absorbed in the test object. Then one of these groups is guaranteed to contain a higher proportion of black objects than the original ensemble. The black objects are laid out as a neutron detector plus absorptive shielding. A neutron interacting with a black object would certainly be absorbed by it. Therefore, the result shows interaction-free measurement at work.

It is shown that the grand partition function of an ideal Bose system with single particle spectrum i = (2n + k + 3/2)¯  is identical to that of a system of particles with single particle energy h i = (n + 1/2)¯  and obeying a particular kind of statistics based on the permutation group. h

arXiv:quant-ph/9708049v1 27 Aug 1997

In the recent literature, one often comes across attempts at establishing the equivalence of dynamical systems having excitations with differing statistics. One celebrated example is the Bose-Fermi equivalence in 1+1 dimensional field theories1 . Another well-known case appears in 2+1 dimensions, where an interacting theory with a ChernSimons term of appropriate coefficient can be made equivalent to another theory with excitations of given spin and statistics2 . Apart from proving the equivalence of the partition functions, one usually constructs suitable operators in a given theory which satisfy the canonical commutation relations of the elementary fields of the model with which equivalence is being sought. In this context, it is interesting to note that often an interacting system with known statistics can be represented by a collection of non-interacting quasi-particles of very different statistics. The so-called exclusion statistics recently advocated by Haldane falls in this category3 . It has recently been shown that the manybody interacting Calogero-Sutherland system (quantized as bosons or fermions) can be thought of, in the statistical sense, as a collection of non-interacting particles obeying Haldane's exclusion statistics4 . In many of these cases, the composite operators of the original model with canonical commutation relations appropriate to the new statistics are not known. In the present work we show that, at the level of the grand partition function, an ideal Bose system with a single particle spectrum (SPS) i = (2n + k + 3/2)¯  h is completely identical to that of a collection of particles with SPS i = (n + 1/2)¯  h , (2) , (1)

but with a rather unusual statistics based on the permutation group. Here n and k are positive integers. As is clear from the SPS (1), the Bose case involves degeneracy of the single-particle energy levels. This type of spectrum arises naturally in elementary systems, such as a particle in two dimensions experiencing a harmonic potential with a frequency ratio 1:2 in the x and y directions respectively. The non-relativistic single-particle Hamiltonian can be written as H= p2 1 p2 y x + + m 2 x2 + 2m 2 y 2 2m 2m 2 . (3)

The second case (2) can be thought of as a particle in a harmonic well in one dimension. We begin with a brief summary of the results obtained in Ref. 5, on which the present work is based. In this work, which makes use of the ideas developed in Ref. 6, it was shown that the the general structure of the canonical partition function for an ideal M -level system corresponding to any quantum statistics based on the permutation group is as follows: ZN (x1 , · · · , xM ) =
 

s (x1 , · · · , xM ) ,

(4)

where xi  exp(-i ), i = 1, · · · , M , i denote the energies corresponding to the states i = 1, · · · , M , and   (1 , · · · , M ). Here 1  2  · · · M denotes a partition of N , the number of particles. The prime on the sum on the R.H.S. of (4) is to indicate possible restrictions on the partitions  of N . As we shall see later, different restrictions on  correspond to different quantum statistics. The functions s (x1 , · · · , xM ) that appear in (4) denote the Schur functions7,8 which are homogeneous, symmetric polynomials of degree N in the variables x1 , · · · , xM . Explicitly, the Schur functions are given by s (x1 , · · · , xM ) = det(xi j

(d) Parabose statistics9 of order p: l()  p. The explicit expression for the grand canonical partition function in this case, to the best of our knowledge, is not known. The list given above contains only those quantum statistics based on the permutation group which have been extensively studied in the literature. For these statistics one has a second quantized formulation available with a rather simple algebra of creation and annihilation operators. However, one could, in principle, define new kinds of statistics, also based on the permutation group, by putting restrictions on  in (7) other than those considered above. Some of these possibilities are listed below: (e) p-q statistics: l()  p ; l( )  q. No explicit formula for the grand canonical partition function for this case is known.

The close similarity in the structure of the grand canonical partition function of a Bose system (a) and that for a system obeying the statistics defined in (h) suggests the possibility of interpreting a system with a certain SPS obeying the latter statistics as a Bose system with a different SPS. This possibility is, in fact, realised by the SPS given in (1) and (2), as can be seen from the following. Consider a Bose system with the single-particle spectrum given by (1). It can easily be seen that the states corresponding to the energies 3¯ /2 and 5¯ /2 are non-degenerate, the states 7¯ /2 and 9¯ /2 are doubly degenerate, h h h h the states 11¯ /2 and 13¯ /2 are threefold degenerate, and so on. The grand canonical partition function for this h h Bose system is therefore given by ZB = 1 h 1 - e-¯  1 h 1 - e-5¯

h where  = e-(¯ /2-µ) . Next, consider a system with the single particle spectrum given by (2) but obeying the statistics specified by (h). Substituting the explicit expressions for i into (14), one finds that the grand canonical partition function for this    h system is exactly the same as that in (15) with  replaced by  where  = e-(¯ -2µ) . Since  (or  ) is to be determined by fixing the mean number of particles, one finds that the two systems, at the level of grand canonical partition functions are equivalent. In other words, the grand canonical partition function of the first system can be interpreted in terms of the second system which has a different single particle spectrum and is governed by a different statistics. To conclude, we have shown the equivalence of two systems with different single particle spectra and obeying different statistics. One of the two systems has a "complicated" single-particle spectrum (in the sense that the SPS has degeneracies) but obeys a "simple" (Bose) statistics while the other system has a "simple" ( i.e. non-degenerate) spectrum but obeys a somewhat exotic statistics.

Introduction

In the early 1980's, various authors started to investigate the generalization of information theory concepts to allow the representation of information by quantum states. The introduction into computation of quantum physical concepts, in particular the superposition principle, opened up the possibility of new capabilities, such as quantum cryptography [1], that have no classical counterparts. One of the most intriguing of these new ideas is quantum computation, first proposed by Benioff [2]. Subsequently Feynman [3] suggested that quantum computation might be more powerful than classical computation. This notion gained further credence through the work of Deutsch who introduced the idea of quantum parallelism to describe the ability of a quantum computer to compute with quantum superpositions of numbers [4]. Deutsch and Josza illustrated this power of quantum computation with an Oracle problem [5]. However, until 1994 quantum computation was an essentially academic endeavor because there were no quantum algorithms that exploited this power to solve interesting computational problems, and because no realistic hardware capable of performing quantum computations had been envisioned. But then, building on earlier work of Simon [6], Shor discovered quantum algorithms for efficient solution of two problems that are at the heart of the security of much of modern public key cryptography: integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem [7, 8]. Later in 1994 Cirac and Zoller proposed that quantum computational hardware could be realized using known techniques in the laser manipulation of trapped ions [9]. Since then interest in quantum computation has grown dramatically, with several groups, including our own, now pursuing trapped ion and other quantum computation experiments. Since 1994 remarkable progress has been made: a single quantum logic gate has been demonstrated with trapped ions [10]; quantum error correction schemes have been invented [11, 12]; and quantum algorithms for solving new problems have been discovered [13, 14, 15, 16]. In this paper we will review the subject of quantum computation and our development of an experiment using trapped calcium ions. Also, we will explore the potential of this technology and determine whether the future obstacles to progress will be fundamental or technical. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the essential principles of quantum computation are introduced. Section 3 briefly describes the potential for efficiently factoring large numbers with a quantum computer. In section 4, we discuss various quantum computational hardware ideas; the trapped ion proposal is then described in detail in section 5. The experiment we are undertaking to realize 2

such a trapped ion quantum computer is described in section 6, and the last section summarizes our conclusions.

The Principles of Quantum Computation

The principles of quantum computation have been discussed in detail elsewhere (see for example [8, 17]) so we shall only give a very brief introduction here. The essential idea of quantum computation is to represent binary numbers using a collection of two-level quantum systems. We will use the notation {|0 , |1 } to denote the states of a single two-level quantum system, known as a quantum bit or qubit. With multiple qubits the number of degrees of freedom in the system rapidly increases: the Hilbert space describing the state of a system containing N qubits has 2N dimensions. It is possible to use such a system to represent a number, x, between 0 and 2N - 1 , as the state
N -1 i=0

|x  where x =
N -1 i=0

|xi i ,

(2.1)

xi 2i , and xi is the ith binary digit of x. Thus, for example, the decimal

number 11, which is written as 1011 in binary, would be represented by four qubits in the state |1 3 |0 2 |1 1 |1 0 , which is more conveniently written in the short-hand notation |1011 . To perform computations, we need to be able to perform certain unitary operations that act on sets of qubits, known as quantum logic gates. Because quantum interactions are reversible, the underlying logic of a quantum computer must itself be reversible. Fortunately, it is already known that arbitrary Boolean operations can be constructed reversibly [18], [19]. An example of a reversible logic operation is the NOT operation on a single qubit: NOT : |b  |¯ . b (2.2)

Arithmetic operations require logic operations between two or more qubits. For example, in the controlled-NOT operation on two qubits CNOT : |c |t  |c |t  c , (2.3)

a target qubit, t, is flipped in value when a control qubit, c, has the value 1, but is unchanged when the control has the value 0. The symbol  denotes addition modulo 2, defined by the following truth table: 3

a b 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1

ab 0 1 . 1 0

A second application of the CNOT gate returns the state to its starting value. Another reversible logic gate used in quantum computing is the three-bit controlled controlled-NOT (or Toffoli gate): CCNOT : |c1 |c2 |t  |c1 |c2 | (c1  c2 )  t , where  denotes the logical AND defined by the following truth table: a b 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 ab 0 0 . 0 1 (2.4)

Using the Toffoli and CNOT gates it is possible to construct a simple binary adder: ADD (|a , |b , |0 ) = CNOT1,2 (CCNOT (|a , |b , |0 )) = |a |a  b |a  b (2.5)

which places the sum modulo 2 of the first and second inputs (reading left to right) onto the second output, and the carry bit (originally reading 0) into the third output qubit. (Here, the CNOT-operation on three qubits is defined as: CNOT1,2 : |a |b |c  |a |a  b |c .) With these universal quantum logic gates, arbitrary arithmetic functions can be formed. So far our discussion has not revealed any particular power associated with quantum computation. Indeed, it is clear that the physical requirement of logical reversiblity leads to extra information (relative to conventional computation) being carried forward. This extra information, which allows the input of a logical operation to be determined from the output, imposes additional memory requirements on quantum computation. Nevertheless, it is known that the peculiarly quantum concepts of superposition and interference can be utilized to provide a much more efficient solution of certain problems than is possible on any conventional computer. We consider computations with superpositions of numbers first. A unitary operation on a single qubit can be written as    cos k |0 - i exp (i) sin k |1  |0 2 2 ^  V (k, ) : . (2.6)  cos k |1 - i exp (-i) sin k |0  |1

^ For example, V (1/2, /2) : |0  2-1/2 (|0 + |1 ) , is an equally-weighted superposition of both qubit states. Now, starting with an L-qubit register in the state |0 L-1 ^ |0 , and acting on each qubit with V (1/2, /2) produces a coherent superposi

(|0 i + |1 i ) = 2

-L/2 a=0

|a .

(2.7)

Thus, in a sense the memory of a quantum computer is exponentially large. Now the quantum register state above is a product state, whereas a more typical superposition state of the register will be an entangled state (i.e. a state which cannot be written as a simple tensor product of basis states). Such states can be produced with the aid of quantum logic operations. For example, an entangled state of two qubits can be produced from an initial product state: CNOT : 2-1/2 (|0 + |1 ) |0  2-1/2 (|0 |0 + |1 |1 ) . (2.8)

Entangled states are required during typical quantum computations (and it is the existence of such entanglements that distinguish a quantum computer from a classical computer), but because of their non-classical properties the CNOT operation is extremely difficult to construct in a physical system. Thus far we have seen the power of quantum memory. Now we explore the power of actual quantum computations. Let us suppose that we have determined the sequence of quantum gates required to evaluate (reversibly) the value of some function, F, for an arbitrary input, a: ^ F : |a |0  |a |F (a) , (2.9) where the argument is held in the left register, and the right register is to hold the function value. We might as easily have started with the left register in an equallyweighted superposition of all values, and applied the same sequence of logic gates: ^ F :
2L -1 a=0 2L -1

|a |0 

a=0

|a |F (a) ,

(2.10)

evaluating all 2L function values in one step. (Recall that the initial state of the left register can be created from the |0 state with only L-single qubit unitary operations.) If we were only interested in the function values we would now have to repeat the creation of this state O(2L) times, and measure the right register each time in order to determine the values. Obviously, for this type of problem quantum computation 5

offers no advantages, but if we were instead interested in some joint property shared by all the function values, such as the function's period, we could now perform a quantum Fourier transform (QFT) operation on the left register to determine the period efficiently. The point is that particular function values in the right register are associated with sequences of values in the left register that reflect the period. The QFT, which is given by the following formula |a  2
-L 2 2L -1

exp i
c=0

a.c |c , 2L

(2.11)

regroups these sequences to produce constructive interference at values corresponding to periods of the sequence. Furthermore, the QFT itself can be constructed using only O(L2 ) quantum gates, whereas a conventional discrete Fourier transform requires O(L2L) operations for a L-bit input register. For problems that can be reduced to determining the period of a function, quantum computation may offer a more efficient solution than conventional computation. All known quantum algorithms to solve interesting problems use either the QFT or one of its variants, such as the quantum Hadamard transformation.

Quantum Factoring

The power of quantum computing can be illustrated with the example of Shor's algorithm for integer factorization. According to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every integer has a unique expression as a product of primes. Most modern factoring algorithms use as their starting point the Legendre congruence: given a composite integer, N, which we want to factor, the congruence y 2 = 1 mod (N) (3.1)

has non-trivial solutions, y = ±a mod (N), in addition to the trivial solutions, y = ±1 mod (N). If a non-trivial solution, a, can be found, it can be used to find a factor of N, because the congruence (a + 1) (a - 1) = 0 mod (N) (3.2)

implies that the factors of N are distributed between the two parentheses. Therefore, the greatest common divisor (gcd) gcd(a ± 1, N) = factor of N, 6 (3.3)

which can be found using Euclid's algorithm, gives a factor of N. The problem of integer factorization can therefore be reduced to finding a suitable a. Shor's algorithm for finding factors using a quantum computer starts by using a classical computer to find an integer x which shares no common factors other than 1 with N: (x, N) = 1 (3.4) Once a value of x is known the function given by the following expression can be defined: fx (z) = xz mod (N) , z = 0, 1, 2, · · · , N 2 - 1. (3.5) This function will be periodic, with some period r, (known as the order of x mod (N)). Mathematically, for some r, fx (z + r) = fx (z) , (3.6) and hence xr = 1 mod (N) . (3.7) Thus, if r is even a = xr/2 mod (N) is a candidate solution of Legendre's congruence and hence allows factorization of N. (There are some technicalities about the choice of the upper limit to the domain of fx and the classical post-processing required to deduce r from the quantum part of the algorithm.) Shor's algorithm requires a 2 log2 N bit left quantum register to hold the argument z, and an l = log2 N bit right register to hold the value of the function f:
2l-1 l-1

| =

i=0

|0

iL j=0

|0

jR

 |0 L |0

R

(3.8)

where the suffix i (j) denotes the i-th (j-th) qubit of the left (right) register respectively. Next, the left register is prepared in a superposition of all possible values, z, using ^ 2l operations, V (1/2, /2), one for each qubit:
22l -1

| 

i=0

1 ^ Vi (1/2, /2) | = l 2

2l-1 i=0

|z L |0

R

 |1

(3.9)

In the next step the function fx (z) is written into the right register: |1 1  l 2
22l -1 i=0

|z L |fx (z)

R

 |2

(3.10)

Because the function fx is an exponential, the computation to build the function can be broken down into repeated multiplications, which can be reduced to repeated 7

addition, and ultimately represented in terms of the simple adder and similar circuits. The total number of quantum gates required is therefore O (l3 ) and some additional register space (roughly 2l qubits) is required for this computation to proceed reversibly. The resulting state has the form |2  1 2l |z0 + jr L |fx (z0 )
R

(3.11)

z0

j

in which sequences of left register states, separated by the period r, are associated with common right register states. At this stage, it is easier to think about making a measurement of the right register, resulting in a particular value f (z0 ) : |2  |  |z0 + jr L . (3.12)

j

Finally, a quantum Fourier transform can be performed on this state after which a measurement is made, resulting in some value 22l /jr for some j. From this result, the order r can be determined, and hence N can be factored. Note that there are some subtleties involved when r does not divide 22l , and also the algorithm must be repeated until an x with an even r is found. To put Shor's factoring algorithm in perspective, the total number of logic gates, Ng and the total number of qubits L required to factor an -bit integer using a version of the algorithm that we have recently developed are [20]: Ng = 243 + O(2 ) L = 5 + 4. (3.13)

In contrast, the best algorithm for factoring a large integers N using classical computers is the (general) Number Field Sieve (NFS) [21], which runs in an asymptotic heuristic time TR given by: (3.14) TR  exp 1.9231/3 (log )2/3 . The NFS has much faster growth with the number of bits in N than the polynomial growth of the quantum algorithm. The NFS was recently used to factor the 130digit (430-bit) integer known as RSA130 [22] using approximately 500 MIPS-years of computer time distributed over the Internet. (1 MIPS-year is approximately 3.0 × 1013 instructions.) With one hundred machines each rated at 100 MIPS dedicated to this problem we would estimate a factoring time of approximately 18 days. In contrast the quantum factoring algorithm applied to the same integer would require only  2.0×109 8

quantum logic gates. If a quantum computer had a clock speed of 100 MHz it would factor this number in only 20 seconds. Furthermore, the tremendous efficiency of the quantum computer would become even more pronounced with larger numbers.

Quantum Computer Technologies

The three essential requirements for quantum computational hardware are: (1) the ability to isolate a set of two-level quantum systems from the environment for long enough to maintain coherence throughout the computation, while at the same time being able to interact with the systems strongly enough to manipulate them into an arbitrary quantum state; (2) a mechanism for performing quantum logic operations: in other words a "quantum bus channel" connecting the various two-level systems in a quantum mechanical manner; and (3) a method for reading out the quantum state of the system at the end of the calculation. So far the serious proposals for quantum computational hardware fall into five basic categories: 1. Ion traps. In this scheme the quantum data registers consist of internal levels of ions trapped in a linear configuration; the quantum bus channel is realized using the phonon modes of the ions' collective oscillations; and readout is performed by using quantum jumps. This scheme was originally proposed by Cirac and Zoller in 1994 [9], and was used to demonstrate a CNOT gate shortly afterwards [10]. The number of qubits that can be realized using an ion trap is limited by the various decoherence mechanisms, which have been discussed in detail elsewhere [23, 24, 25, 26], and by the onset of instabilities in the linear configuration of the ions [27]. One estimate [23] suggests that computations involving 47 qubits and 4.0 × 105 operations may be possible with trapped Calcium ions before decoherence becomes a serious problem, although this estimate ignores experimental decoherence effects such as ion heating and fluctuations of laser phases, as well as recent advances in the field of quantum error correction. (A variant of this idea using a photon mode of a cavity as the quantum bus bit has also been proposed [28].) Our progress towards realizing a trapped ion quantum computer is the subject of the remainder of this article. 2. Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (Cavity QED). Here the quantum data register consists of the photon modes of an optical cavity, which are linked to other modes via excitation of, and emission by, an atom passing through the cavity. This scheme is a development of experiments in cavity quantum electrodynamics, and it has been used

9

successfully to realize quantum gates, although scaling up to more than 2 or 3 qubits will probably be very difficult [29, 30]. A related all photon cavity QED realization has been proposed [31]. 3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The orientation of spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule form the data register, and the spin-spin interactions provide the quantum bus channel. The states of the spins can be altered by applying a radio-frequency magnetic field and readout is performed by measuring the magnetization of bulk samples, a procedure which can only measure an ensemble average of the quantum state populations. There are considerable subtleties associated with preparation of the initial states as well as with the readout; for this reason, the NMR scheme has been called "ensemble quantum computing" [32] (see also [33]). This method has been used to realize experimental quantum gates involving two and three qubits [34], however because the signal falls exponentially with the number of qubits, the ability to scale up to large numbers of qubits seems to be problematic [35]: the sources cited above give estimates of the largest number of qubits that can be realized with NMR computers that vary from 6 to 20. Similar concepts involving electron spins [36], the use of atomic force microscopy to manipulate nuclear spins [37] and the interactions between electron and nuclear spins in the quantum Hall regime [38] have been proposed. 4. Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDS). In this proposed realization, which is still being developed and has not yet been used to realize a quantum logic gate, the quantization of flux in a superconducting circuit would be exploited to give two level systems [39, 40, 41]. The principal attraction of this proposal is that it is a solid state device, and so if it can be made to work with a small number of qubits, scaling up to large numbers of qubits should be relatively straightforward because the technology for making miniaturized solid state devices containing a very large number of computing elements already exists. However, solid state devices will also have their drawbacks, in that they will be strongly coupled to a complex environment, so decoherence may become an insurmountable problem. 5. Quantum Dots. Quantum dots are regions of artificial inhomogeneity in a crystal, which can be placed in a controlled manner. They can be used to trap single electrons, the orientation of whose spin can then be used as to store information [42, 43]. Like the SQUID proposal, this idea has not yet been used to demonstrate a logic gate, but offers the same advantage of being a solid state device.

Theory of Quantum Computation with Ions in a Linear Trap

We shall now describe in detail the Cirac-Zoller trapped-ion quantum computer concept [9] (see also refs. [44, 45]). In this scheme, illustrated in fig.1, each qubit is the electronic ground state (|0 ) and a metastable excited state (|1 ) of an ion, which has been laser cooled to rest in a linear radio-frequency quadrupole ion trap. Computational operations are performed with coherent laser-ion interactions driving Rabi oscillations between the relevant quantum states of the register. At the end of the computation, the results are read out using the quantum jump technique. The principal advantages of the trapped ion scheme are that many of the techniques required to prepare and manipulate quantum states have already been developed for precision spectroscopy work; secondly that the decoherence rates owing to decay of the excited ionic state and heating of the ionic motion can be made small in the virtually perturbation-free (ultra-high vacuum, low electromagnetic noise level) environment of an ion trap; and finally there is an experimentally demonstrated technique, quantum jumps, for reading out the result of a computation with high probability. The first step that must be accomplished for quantum computation is to prepare an isolated quantum state of several ions in which each ion is spatially localized and cooled to the quantum ground state of its vibrational motion. The techniques employed for trapping and cooling the ions are described in detail below. Operating the trap at low ion densities, Doppler cooling produces a so-called "string-of-pearls" configuration: the ions become arranged in a line and each is localized in a spatial region whose dimensions are very much less than the wavelength of the optical transition. The spacing between adjacent ions can be made conveniently large (30 µm, say) by striking a balance between their Coulomb repulsion and the axial confining potential. This crystallized structure permits the ions to be addressed by lasers for quantum computation. It has been demonstrated that a single ion can be cooled to its vibrational ground state in an ion trap using resolved sideband cooling in the optical regime [46]. Because we shall employ the quanta of the ions' collective vibrations (i.e. phonons) as a "quantum bus channel" connecting different qubits, these vibrations must initially be in their ground states. However, cooling to the vibrational ground state has yet to be demonstrated for two or more ions. With the ions in their internal and phonon ground states and with the cooling lasers turned off the system is prepared for the actual quantum computation to begin.

Phonon Modes

We shall assume that ions are sufficiently tightly bound in the directions transverse to the trap axis that we need only consider their motion along the axial direction (i.e. the x-axis in fig.1). Suppose that the m-th ion is displaced a small distance qm from its equilibrium position x0 . The Lagrangian for the oscillations of the ions about their m equilibrium positions is L (qm , qm ) =  M 2

where N is the number of ions, M is the mass of each ion and the coupling matrix Cnm is defined by 2V Cnm = , (5.2) xn xm 0 where V here stands for the ions' potential energy, and the subscript 0 denotes that the double partial derivative is evaluated at qn = qm = 0. The potential energy, which consists of two parts, the binding potential due to the trap electrodes and the Coulomb interaction energy between the ions themselves, is given by: V (xm ) =
N 1 e2 1 2 Mx xm (t)2 + , 80 |xn (t) - xm (t)| m=1 2 n,m=1 m=n N

(5.3)

where xm (t) = x0 + qn (t) is the position of the m-th ion, e is the charge of the electron m (we have assumed that the ions are singly ionized), 0 is the permittivity of free space and x is the angular frequency characterizing the the harmonic binding potential. If there were only one ion confined in the trapping potential, then its oscillations would be harmonic with this angular frequency. The elements of the matrix Cnm may be calculated by differentiating eq.(5.3) and evaluated using the values for the equilibrium positions of the ions, obtained numerically (see ref. [49]). (p) The eigenvectors bm (p = 1, 2, . . . N) of the matrix Cnm are defined by the following formulas:
N (p) (p) Cnm bn = µ2 bm (p = 1, . . . , N) , p n=1

(5.4)

where µ2 (p = 1, 2, . . . N) are the eigenvalues (which are always positive). The eigenp vectors are assumed to be numbered in order of increasing eigenvalue and to be properly normalized. The first eigenvector (i.e. the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue) can be shown to be 1 b(1) =  {1, 1, . . . , 1} , µ1 = 1 . (5.5) N 12

The normal modes of the ion motion are defined by the formula

(5.6)

The first mode Q1 (t) corresponds to all of the ions oscillating back and forth as if they were rigidly clamped together; this is referred to as the center of mass (CM) mode. The second mode Q2 (t) corresponds to each ion oscillating with an amplitude proportional to its equilibrium distance from the trap center. This is called the breathing mode. There are a total of N modes altogether. The Lagrangian for the ion oscillations, eq. (5.1), may be rewritten in terms of these normal modes as follows: M N 2 2 L (qm , qm ) =  (5.7) Q - µ2 x Q2 . p p 2 p=1 p   Thus the canonical momentum conjugate to Qp is Pp  L/ Qp = M Qp , and we can write the Hamiltonian as 1 N 2 M N P + (x µp )2 Q2 . (5.8) H (pm , qm ) = p 2M p=1 p 2 p=1 The quantum motion of the ions can now be considered by introducing the operators: ^ Qp  Qp = i ^ Pp  Pp = h ¯ ap - a ^ ^p 2Mx µp hMx µp ¯ ap + a ^ ^p 2 . , (5.9) (5.10)

^ ^ ^ ^ where Qp and Pp obey the canonical commutation relation Qp , Pq = i¯ pq and the h  creation and annihilation operators ap and ap obey the usual commutation relation ^ ^ ap , a = pq . ^ ^q We shall use the interaction picture to perform calculations of the effect of laser fields on the trapped ions. The unperturbed Hamiltonian describes the free evolution of the internal states of the ions and the oscillations of the ions' normal modes. The effect of the laser field will be described by an interaction Hamiltonian introduced below. The interaction picture operator for the displacement of the m-th ion from its equilibrium position is:

Laser-ion interactions
"V" Type Operations: Single Qubit Interactions

There are two different ways of performing quantum computational laser operations on the qubits formed from two-level ions. The most simple is the single frequency Rabi oscillations between two states. If the two level system interacts with a monochromatic field precisely tuned to the transition frequency for the two levels, the population will oscillate back and forth between the two levels (fig. 3.a) [47, 48]. A long-lived two level system is required to make a qubit suitable for quantum computation, and so atomic levels with dipole-forbidden transitions are the most suitable. An example of such a dipole forbidden transition is the 729 nm 4 2 S1/2 to 3 2D5/2 transition in Ca+ (fig.2), which has a natural lifetime of about 1.06 seconds (see ref.[49] for more details and references to the sources of atomic data). The other method of performing manipulations on the qubits of an ion trap quantum computer is to use Raman transitions (fig.3.b). This technique was used by the Boulder group in their experimental realization of a quantum logic gate using a cold trapped ion [10]. Two lasers, traditionally named the "pump" and the "Stokes" beams, are tuned so that population from one level is pumped to some intermediate virtual level by one laser, and then immediately brought back down from the virtual level to a different atomic state by the second laser [50, 51]. This method has some advantages over the single laser technique, because it is resilient against phase fluctuations of the addressing laser and because one can use two states with very long decay times, for example the two magnetic sub-levels of the 4 2 S1/2 level of Ca+ . However it also has the complication that one needs to precisely control the position and direction of two laser beams rather than the one required for the first method. It may be that for the experimental devices now under construction, which will consist of only a few qubits, the first technique will prove superior. The interaction picture Hamiltonian describing the resonant interaction of a two

14

level system with a laser can be written as follows: i¯ 0 h ^ exp (it)|0 1| + h.a. HI = 2 (5.14)

where h.a. stands for the Hermitian adjoint of the immediately preceding term. The Rabi frequency 0 is defined by

In these formulas,  is a coefficient of order 1 which depends on the laser polarizations and the quantum numbers of the states involved (for details see [49, 51]); E is the complex electric field strength for the single laser; Ep and Es are the complex electric field strengths of the pump and Stokes lasers respectively; A and k are, in the single laser case, the Einstein A coefficient and the wavenumber for the qubit transition, and in the Raman case, the A coefficient and the wavenumber for the transition from the two qubit levels |0 and |1 to the third detuned level, |2 (see fig.3) 4 ;  is the detuning of the virtual level from level |2 . The detuning, , which appears in eq.(5.14) is given by the following formula: =
    

0 - L

single laser (5.16)

0 - (p - s ) Raman

where 0 is the angular transition frequency for the |0 to |1 transition, L is the angular laser frequency (single laser case) and p and s are the pump and Stokes angular frequencies respectively (Raman case) 5 . If we assume that the detuning in eq.(5.14) is zero, and that only the states |0 and |1 can become populated, i.e. the wavefunction for the qubit is |(t) = a(t)|0 + b(t)|1 , then the equation of motion, i¯ h  ^ |(t) = HI |(t) , t (5.17)

4 If |0 and |1 are magnetic sublevels of the same level, then the value of A will be the same for them both. 5 We have ignored the A.C. Stark shifts of the two qubit levels caused by the two Raman lasers. This effect will mean that the on-resonance condition will not be exactly  = 0, and there will be a small phase shift in the execution of CNOT gates as a result. This is discussed in detail in ref.[51]

where  = |0 |t and  = arg{0 }. Thus, by directing an on-resonance laser pulse at a particular ion, an arbitrary superposition of the |0 and |1 states can be created from the |0 state by carefully controlling the duration and phase of the pulse. The effect of such a pulse, which we will refer to as a "V" pulse, on the m-th ion's internal states is represented by the ^ single-ion unitary operation, Vm (, ), |0 ^ Vm (, ) : |1

However, these operations all have the form of a rotation, whereas quantum logical operations are required that have the form of a reflection, such as the NOT operation: NOT : |0 |1

We can perform these operations with the aid of an auxiliary level, |aux . The auxiliary level, which is a vital ingredient of Cirac and Zoller's scheme, is some third state of the ion which will interact with |0 in precisely the same manner as |0 interacts with |1 , but which does not interact at all with |1 . For example, we can use the 42 S1/2 , MJ = 1/2 and the 32 D5/2 , MJ = 3/2 states of Ca+ as |0 and |1 for our qubits. The auxiliary level can then be the 32 D5/2 , MJ = -1/2 state. We can perform operations between |0 and |1 using right-hand circularly polarized light. If we switch 16

to left circularly polarized light we can perform operations between |0 and |aux , without changing the state of |1 .

"U" Type Operations: Interactions with the Quantum Bus Channel

To describe the ability of the laser beam to excite or annihilate quanta of the ions' collective vibrations, it is necessary to modify the interaction Hamiltonian (5.14) by taking into account the spatial variation of the the laser field as follows: E  E(^m ) = E(r0 + ex qm ) r ^ m E  Eeq + qm ^ x

(5.26)
0

where r0 is the equilibrium position of the m-th ion, ex is the unit vector in the axial m (x) direction, qm is the quantum operator describing the vibration of the m-th ion (see ^ 5.12) and the subscript 0 denotes a term which has been evaluated at the equilibrium position of the ion. For simplicity, we shall neglect all of the phonon modes except for the CM mode (p=1). We therefore obtain the following modified form of the interaction Hamiltonian: i¯ 0 h ^ HI = exp (it)|0 1| 2 i¯ 1 h exp (it)|0 1| a exp(-ix t) - a exp(ix t) + h.a. ^ ^ + 2 Here 0 is given by eq.(5.15), and 1 = h ¯ 2Mx N 0 x ,

In this case, ignoring the off-resonant terms, eq. (5.27) becomes -i¯ 1  h ^ HI = a |0 1| + h.a. ^ (5.31) 2 This Hamiltonian is equivalent to that introduced by Jaynes and Cummings to describe the interaction of a two-level system with a single quantized harmonic oscillator [53]. If we assume that we are limited to two possible states: |1  |0 phonons and |0  |1 phonon , which we shall denote as |1, 0 and |0, 1 respectively, the wavefunction for the ion is |  (t) = c(t)|0, 1 + d(t)|1, 0 . The equation of motion (5.17) can then be solved:  c(t) cos( /2) iei sin( /2) c(0) = (5.32) -i   d(t) d(0) ie sin( /2) cos( /2) where  = |1 |t and  = arg{1 }. Thus we have interactions which change the CM phonon vibrational mode as well as the ions' internal levels in a controllable manner. We shall refer to such laser interactions as "U" type pulses. The following operation can be realized by these interactions with precise control of the pulse duration and laser phase: |0, 1 ^ Um ( ,  ) : |1, 0

 The expression (5.15) is an approximation which is valid if / N  1. In general the expression for 0 depends on the number of phonons in the system; Monroe et al. recently pointed out that this fact allows one, in principal, to realize quantum gates more simply than by using the Cirac and Zoller auxiliary level scheme [52].

when the m-th ion acquires an amplitude in the |1 phonon state, then all of the other ions in the trap also acquire an amplitude in the |1 phonon state. This amplitude is dependent on the state of the m-th ion. Thus by means of interaction with the CM phonon mode, the internal state of any ion in the trap can be changed conditionally on the internal state of any other ion. The two-level system {|0 phonons , |1 phonon } can be considered as an additional qubit that acts as a quantum bus channel, that can be used to transfer quantum information between different ions in the quantum register. From these basic building blocks, a CNOT gate between ions c ("control") and t ("target") can be constructed from the sequence of five laser pulses ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ CNOTct = Vt (/2, /2)Uc (, 0) Utaux (2, 0) Uc (, 0) Vt (/2, /2). (5.34)

5.3

Readout

Once the computational state manipulations required are completed, the result must be read out, which means that the state of each qubit must be measured. This can be accomplished using the quantum jump technique, which is relatively straightforward when using the single laser qubit scheme. For example, with Ca+ ions, each qubit consists of a sub-level of the 4 2S1/2 ground state, |0 , and a sub-level of the 3 2 D5/2 metastable excited state, |1 , (see fig.2). This qubit can be interrogated with the laser tuned to the 4 2 S1/2 to 4 2 P1/2 dipole transition at 397nm. If the ion radiates, its state has been collapsed to the |0 state, whereas if it remains dark then its state has collapsed to the |1 state. The 4 2 P1/2 level can also decay to the 3 2 D3/2 level, and so a pump-out laser at 866nm will also be required in order to stop population being trapped in that metastable level. With the Raman scheme, readout is a little more complicated. Assume that |0 and |1 are the MJ = -1/2 and MJ = +1/2 sublevels of the 4 2 S1/2 ground state, respectively. The most straightforward method of performing the readout in these circumstances is to apply a  pulse from the |1 (or |0 ) state to a sub-level of the 3 2 D5/2 state, and then use a laser at 397nm to observe fluorescence (if any) due to population in the |0 (or |1 ) state, as in the single laser scheme. Alternatively, a  - circularly polarized laser at 393nm can excite population from |0 state to the MJ = -3/2 sub-level of the 4 2 P3/2 level, which will decay by dipole emission back to |0 . One can avoid exciting population from the |1 level by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field that the transition from this state to the 4 2 P3/2 MJ = -1/2 19

sub-level is shifted off resonance by the Zeeman effect (a magnetic field of 200 Gauss should be sufficient for this purpose). However, the 4 2 P3/2 MJ = -3/2 sub-level can also decay to both the 3 2 D3/2 and 3 2 D5/2 levels, and pumping out the population trapped in these states might be lead to difficulties.

5.4.1

Tolerances and Laser Requirements
Pulse Durations and Standing Waves

In deriving the formulas that describe the effects of laser pulses on the qubits we have made various assumptions which allow us to discard off-resonant terms in the Hamiltonian. The criteria for making these approximations place constraints on the experimental parameters, in particular the duration of the various laser pulses required to perform operations. For the V-type pulses, we have neglected terms involving coupling to phonon modes. These can be neglected provided that (1 /x )2  1. Using eq. 5.28, and the fact that the duration of a V-type  pulse is tV = /0 , we find that the pulse duration must obey the following inequality: tV    . Nx (5.35)

For 10 Ca+ ions in a trap with a 2 ×500 kHz axial angular frequency, eq.(5.35) implies that tV  7.5 nsec for the single laser scheme and tV  14 nsec for the Raman scheme. This condition will become easier to satisfy as the number of ions N grows large. For U-type pulses, we have neglected the terms in the interaction Hamiltonian (5.27) which give rise to "direct" transitions, i.e. those that do not involve the creation or annihilation of a phonon. Using a similar argument, one can show that the duration of a U-type -pulse must obey the following inequality:   N tU  (traveling wave). (5.36) x Thus if we have a large number of ions in our trap, the duration of the sideband detuned U pulses must become very long. Using the same example that we quoted for the V pulses, i.e. 10 Ca+ ions in a 2 × 500 kHz trap, (5.36) implies that tU  130 µsec for the single laser scheme and tU  72 µsec for the Raman scheme. A method by which these pulse durations can be made shorter has been suggested by Cirac and Zoller and co-workers ([9, 54]). If one were to apply the laser field in a configuration such that 0 were zero, but 1 was non-zero, then the direct transition 20

terms in the Hamiltonian (5.27) would be zero. For example, the single laser could be used in a standing wave configuration such that one has a node at the location of the ion one is trying to address 7 . In these circumstances, one would still have to worry about the possibility of exciting the "wrong" phonon modes, and it can be shown [49] that this places the following constraint on the duration of U-type  pulses: tU  2.6 (standing wave). x (5.37)

This has the advantage that the duration of U-type pulses is independent of the number of ions in the trap. Again using the example of 10 Ca+ ions in a 2 × 500 kHz trap, the durations of the U-pulses must be tU  2.6 µsec when we have standing waves. However there are considerable technical difficulties in arranging a laser beam, which must have a component of its wavevector parallel to the trap axis, in a standing wave configuration, with all of the ions either at a node or an anti-node. Thus for the small number of ions which will be involved in the first generation ion-trap quantum computers, it seems that the practical problems associated with building an optical system that allows us to address the ions with standing waves will outweigh the advantages of having shorter pulses. However, they will probably be required if we are to have a computer with more than a few qubits. 5.4.2 Laser Power Requirements

The expressions for the Rabi frequencies, eqs.(5.15) and (5.28), relate the rate of flipping between the two levels |0 and |1 to the electric field strength of the lasers. From these formulas, we can derive an expression relating the laser power to the duration of the various pulses. This is important information to know when determining the specifications of the laser system which must be built. The power in a Gaussian laser beam is given by (ref. [55], eq.14.5.27, p.488) P = c0 2 2 w0 |E| , 4 (5.38)

where c is the velocity of light, 0 is the permittivity of the vacuum and w0 is the 1/e2 radius of the focal spot. On substituting from eq. (5.28), we find the laser power is
Note that the roles of nodes and anti-nodes are reversed for quadrupole allowed transitions. For details, see ref.[49].

P  

hw0 L x NM ¯ 2 At2 U hw0 L NM ¯ 2 2 cAtU 

(single laser) . NM¯ x (Raman) h (5.39)

We have assumed that, in the Raman case, the pump and Stokes lasers have approximately the same power. In these formulas, tU is the duration of a U-type -pulse, i.e. tU = /1 ; the other symbols have the same meaning as given above (see the paragraph following eq.(5.15)). For 10 Calcium ions, assuming a pulse duration tU of 5 µsec (which is compatible with the minimum pulse duration when standing waves are employed), a laser spot size w0 of 10 µm, an axial frequency x of 2×500 kHz, and a Raman detuning  of 2×100 MHz, the power required for the single laser scheme is 25 mW, compared to a required power of 0.11 µW for the Raman scheme. Longer pulses, which would be required if standing waves are not used, would need less power. 5.4.3 Error Rates and Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing

In the two years since Cirac and Zoller's original proposal was published, there have been several calculations of the limitations of the capabilities of such devices due to various decoherence effects [23, 24, 25]. While these investigations are useful for identifying theoretically the various important decoherence processes, none of them take into account the recent breakthroughs in the realm of fault tolerant quantum computation [11, 12]. As mentioned in the introduction, it has been demonstrated that, provided quantum gates can be performed within a certain threshold degree of accuracy (the most optimistic estimate of which is  10-6 ), then in principle arbitrarily large quantum computations can be performed accurately. This sets an obvious figure of merit for quantum computation technology, namely, the expected probability of error in one quantum gate. For trapped ion quantum computers using the single laser addressing scheme, there are two principal fundamental causes of error which we must examine: spontaneous emission from the upper level of the qubit, and breakdown of the two-level system. The first suggests that we should use the shortest possible laser pulses, so that the gate operation is completed quickly, before the upper level can decay. The second type of error is reduced by using very low laser powers, and so long duration laser pulses should be the best. Thus there is an optimum situation when these two effects balance. If 22

we then use the limiting cases given by eqs.(5.36) and (5.37), we obtain the following expression for the minimum possible error probability per CNOT using Ca+ ions:  8.9 × 10-6 N 1/3 (standing wave) 3.6 × 10-5 N 1/2 (traveling wave) (5.40)

Thus although the use of standing waves will reduce the error significantly, it still does not appear that it will be possible to meet the existing accuracy thresholds using single laser addressing. (Other species of ion give similar results.) This, however, does not imply that quantum computation experiments using single laser addressing are without merit; discounting the possibility that further theoretical advances may reduce the error threshold, the single laser system will still be useful as a experimental device for performing limited gate operations on a dozen or so qubits, which will allow one to confirm both the practicality of quantum computation with cold trapped ions, as well as aspects of the theory of fault tolerant quantum computation. Using the Raman system, the fundamental source of error we have to worry about is spontaneous emission from the upper level |2 of the three level system (see fig. 3.b). As the average population in this level and the rate at which the quantum gate is performed are both proportional to the laser power, the error rate can be shown to be independent of the duration of the laser pulses [71]. One can minimize this error by using the largest possible Raman detuning  and the smallest possible axial frequency x . However, when one is detuned from one level by a large amount, one can come into resonance with another level; hence, when calculating the error, all of the ion's levels must be taken into account. The smallest practical trap frequency can be estimated to be 100 Hz, although the experimental problems associated with cooling at this frequency are more than a little daunting. In this case, the error per gate for Ca+ ions is   1.3 × 10-8 N 1/2 . (5.41) This implies that in theory it may be possible to perform reliable quantum computations, with errors per gate of the order of 10-6, with 100 Ca+ ions. Similar calculations give even larger numbers (5000) for Be+ ions. The estimates should be viewed with a great deal of caution: throughout the work done on fault tolerant techniques, the assumption was made that the error rate per gate was independent of the number of qubits, and so large numbers of qubits could be used without undue penalty. When the error rate is dependent on the number of qubits, as is the case here, the results are no longer valid. However, they do suggest that some optimism regarding the future of ion trap quantum computation may not be unwarranted. 23

6.1

Experimental Considerations
Choice of Ion

There are three requirements which the species of ion chosen for the qubits of an ion trap quantum computer must satisfy: 1. If we use the single laser scheme, the ions must have a level that is sufficiently long-lived to allow some computation to take place; this level can also be used for sideband cooling. 2. the ions must have a suitable dipole-allowed transition for Doppler cooling, quantum jump readout and for Raman transitions (if we chose to use two sub-levels of the ground state to form the qubit); 3. These transitions must be at wavelengths compatible with current laser technology. Various ions used in atomic frequency standards work satisfy requirement 1: A long-lived transition will have a very narrow spectral line which can be exploited for that application. Examples are Hg + , Ca+ or Ba+ (which have quadrupole allowed transitions in the optical, near infrared or near ultraviolet regions of the spectrum, with lifetimes ranging from hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds; for details, see [49]). An even more exotic possibility is Y b+ which has an optical electric octupole transition with a lifetime of about 10 years [56]. Of these ions, Ca+ offers the advantages of transitions that can be accessed with titanium-sapphire or diode lasers and a reasonably long-lived metastable state. The relevant energy levels of the A = 40 isotope are shown in fig.2. The dipole-allowed transition from the 4 2 S1/2 ground state to the 4 2 P1/2 level with a wavelength of 397 nm can be used for Doppler cooling and quantum jump readout; The 732 nm electric quadrupole transition from the 4 2 S1/2 ground state to the 3 2 D3/2 metastable level (lifetime  1.08sec.) is suitable for sideband cooling. In the single laser computation scheme, the qubits and auxiliary level can be chosen as the electronic states |0 = |4 2 S1/2 , Mj = 1/2 , |1 = |3 2D5/2 , Mj = 3/2 , |aux = |3 2 D5/2 , Mj = -1/2 (6.1) ^ ^ The V and U operations can be driven using left-handed circular polarized 729-nm ^ ^ radiation, while the V aux and U aux operations require right-handed circular polarization. This ion can also be used for Raman type qubits, with the two Zeeman sublevels of the 4 2 S1/2 ground state forming the two qubit states |0 and |1 , with one of the 24

sublevels of the 4 2 P1/2 level being the upper level |2 . As mentioned above, a magnetic field of 200 Gauss should be sufficient to split these two levels so that they can be resolved by the lasers. The pump and Stokes beams would be formed by splitting a 397nm laser into two, and shifting the frequency of one with respect to the other by means of an acousto-optic or electro-optic modulator. This arrangement has a great advantage in that any fluctuations in the phase of the original 397nm laser will be passed on to both the pump and Stokes beams, and will therefore be canceled out, because the dynamics is only sensitive to the difference between the pump and Stokes phases. One problem in realizing the Raman scheme in Ca+ is the absence of a third level in the ground state that can act as the auxiliary state |aux required for execution of quantum gates. This difficulty could be removed by using the alternative scheme for quantum logic recently proposed by Monroe et al. [52]; alternatively, one could use an isotope of Ca+ which has non-zero nuclear spin, thereby giving several more sublevels in the ground state due to the hyperfine interaction 8 ; other possibilities that have been suggested for an auxiliary state with 40 Ca+ in the Raman scheme are to use a state of a phonon mode other than the CM mode [58] or one of the sublevels of the 3 2 D doublet [59].

6.2

The Radio Frequency Ion Trap

Radio-frequency (RF) quadrupole traps, also named "Paul traps" after their inventor, have been used for many years to confine electrically charged particles [60] (for an introduction to the theory of ion traps, see refs. [61, 62]). The classic design of such a Paul trap has a ring electrode with endcap electrodes above and below, with the ions confined to the enclosed volume. A single ion can be located precisely at the center of the trap where the amplitude of the RF field is zero. But when several ions are placed into this trapping field, their Coulomb repulsion forces them apart and into regions where they are subjected to heating by the RF field. For this reason in our experiment ions are confined in a linear RF quadrupole trap. Radial confinement is achieved by a quadrupole RF field provided by four 1 mm diameter rods in a rectangular arrangement. Axial confinement is provided by DC voltages applied to conical endcaps at either end of the RF structure; the endcap separation is 10 mm. The design of the trap used in these experiments is shown in diagrammatically in Figs.4 and 5. An image of a trapped ion is shown in Fig.6.
The only such stable isotope of Calcium is 43 Ca, which has nuclear spin 7/2 and a natural abundance of 0.135%. Enriched samples are available at a cost of $441 per mg [57].

25

The main concerns for the design are to provide sufficient radial confinement to assure that the ions form a string on the trap axis after Doppler cooling; to minimize the coupling between the radial and axial degrees of freedom by producing radial oscillation frequencies significantly greater than the axial oscillation frequencies; to produce high enough axial frequencies to allow the use of sideband cooling[63]; and to provide sufficient spatial separation to allow individual ions to be addressed with laser beams. 6.2.1 Radial Confinement

A sinusoidal voltage with a DC offset,  = DC - RF cos(RF t), is applied to two opposite rods of the RF structure while the other two are grounded. The potential near the center of the trap is z2 - y2 , (6.2)  = o 2 2ro where ro is a constant dependent on the distance from the trap axis to the RF rods and y and z are the distances from the trap axis along the y and z axes, respectively (see fig.1). For this trap, ro =1.4mm. The equation of motion for an ion in this time-dependent quadrupole potential is the well known Matthieu's equation, the solutions of which [64] are parameterized 2 2 2 2 in this case, by the quantities a = 4eDC /(MRF ro ) and q = 2eRF /(MRF ro ). For a proper choice of these parameters, the motion of the ion can be treated by a pseudopotential approach. Here, the ions are described as moving in the effective quadratic potential e2 2 RF (ef f ) = , (6.3) 2 4 4MRF ro  where  = y 2 + z 2 is the radial distance from the trap axis. The total motion consists of a fast ripple superimposed on a slower, larger amplitude oscillation, referred to as the secular motion, of frequency r =  eRF . 2 2MRF ro (6.4)

Typical operating parameters for the trap described are DC = 0, RF = 500 Volts, and RF = (2)× 11.5 MHz. This yields a radial pseudowell of 15 eV depth and a secular motion frequency of r = (2)× 5 MHz. Laser cooling of the ions to the Doppler limit imposed by the natural linewidth of the 4 2 S1/2 - 4 2 P1/2 cooling transition will yield a temperature TDop  85 µK. Comparing this thermal energy with 26

the radial pseudowell depth, we find that the ions should be confined to within roughly 30 nm of the trap axis after Doppler cooling. 6.2.2 Axial Confinement

As mentioned above, axial confinement is provided by conical electrodes at either end of the RF structure. The conical shape allows maximum laser access while providing a large region at the trap center for which the potential is harmonic. A static bias voltage of up to 500 V is applied to both endcaps. When the ions are sufficiently cold, they will crystallize to form a line or "string of pearls". In this configuration the axial force on the m-th ion due to the harmonic binding potential and the Coulomb force upon it due to all of the other ions is given by the formula N e2 1 2 Fm = Mx xm + , (6.5) 40 (xn - xm )2 n=1
m=n

where the symbols have the same meaning as in eq.(5.3). The equilibrium positions of the ions are determined by the set of N equations, Fm = 0, (m = 1, 2, . . . N). For N = 2 or N = 3, the equations may be solved analytically; for larger values of N numerical solutions must be found. For details, see ref. [49]. We find that the minimum inter-ion spacing (which will occur at the middle of the string) for N ions and axial frequency x is given by: xmin (L) = e2 2 40 Mx
1/3

2.018 . N 0.559

(6.6)

This relationship is important in determining the extent of "cross-talk" error in a quantum computer, due to the focal region of lasers overlapping more than one ion. [23]. Figure 7 shows this calculated minimum equilibrium separation as a function of axial oscillation frequency, which is proportional to the square root of the applied trapping voltage. The curve is truncated at (2)×500 kHz, because, as discussed earlier we are interested only in frequencies significantly lower than the 5 MHz secular frequency. Preliminary numerical model calculations [65] for our trap geometry indicated that an endcap voltage of 150 V would yield an axial trapping frequency of roughly (2)×200 kHz. We have experimentally verified this prediction by observing resonance ion heating through parametric excitation of the axial oscillation of the ions. Small number of ions were trapped and laser cooled. A weak RF drive was coupled to the DC input

27

applied to the end caps. The frequency was slowly varied and when the applied frequency was equal to 2 × x a strong heating of the ion cloud was observed. Figure 8 shows the results of these tests in comparison to the numerical calculations. The solid line is a fit to the data assuming a strict quadratic relation between axial frequency and trap potential. The proportionality constant gives the shielding of the external potential by the trap electrodes. As can be seen, when there are two ions in the trap a frequency of (2)×200 kHz corresponds to an ion separation of approximately 20 µm. Hence, to resolve the axial motion sidebands on the ion fluorescence signal and to cool the ions to the vibrational ground level of the axial well, laser linewidths well under (2)×200 kHz will be required. Furthermore, gate operations involving manipulations of individual ions will require laser spot sizes well under 20 µm. The linear configuration of the ions will break down if there are too many ions in the trap. The Coulomb force from ions at the ends of the string will become so great that the radial confinement will become unstable, and the ions will adopt a zig-zag configuration, which is susceptible to RF heating. The radial confinement is characterized by a harmonic frequency r , given by eq. (6.4). Numerical modeling of the zig-zag breakdown (based on the instability of the transverse oscillation modes) gives the following formula for the maximum number of ions that can reside in a linear configuration: r 1.13 Nmax = 1.82 . (6.7) x This formula is in general agreement with that previously worked out by numerical modeling of cold confined plasmas [27]. In the ion trap used in our experiment, r = 2 × 5MHz and x can be in the range from 2 × 500kHz to 2 × 100kHz. Thus the largest number of ions that can be stored in this specific system in a linear configuration varies between 24 and 151 ions respectively. 6.2.3 Thermalization of Trapped Ions and Noise Driven Decoherence

We have theoretically investigated the effects of external noise sources (as opposed to trap RF effects) in regard to ion heating and decoherence [66]. Of the sources considered, which included mechanical vibrations, black body radiation, and Johnson noise, only the latter was found to be significant. By use of a result based on a classical model of the trapped ion [67], Wineland et al. [68] concluded that Johnson noise cannot account for the observed ion heating rate. We have carried the calculation further and have now shown that the heating rate (which in the case of Johnson noise is roughly

28

equal to the harmonic oscillator superposition state decoherence rate) can be explained within a reasonable range of system parameters. The heating rate is proportional to the effective resistances connected across the trap electrodes. However, the fact that this resistance depends on the frequency of the noise fluctuations was not taken into account in [68] where it was concluded that the observed heating rate in a particular experiment was roughly 10 to 100 times faster than predicted by the use of the model in [67]. Our primary conclusions are that it is incorrect to use the DC resistance of the trap electrode interconnections to determine the heating rate, and that in many instances, better insight can be obtained through consideration of the noise correlation time. We hope to experimentally investigate the implications of our theoretical work in the near future.

6.3

Laser Systems

The relevant optical transitions for Ca+ ions are shown in fig.2. There are four different optical processes employed in the quantum computer; each places specific demands on the laser system. The first stage is to cool a small number of ions to their Doppler limit in the ion trap, as shown in fig.(9.a). This requires a beam at 397 nm, the 4 2 S1/2 - 4 2 P1/2 resonant transition. Tuning the laser to the red of the transition causes the ions to be slowed by the optical molasses technique [69]. In this procedure, a laser beam with a frequency slightly less than that of the resonant transition of an ion is used to reduce its kinetic energy. Owing to the Doppler shift of the photon frequency, ions preferentially absorb photons that oppose their motion, whereas they re-emit photons in all directions, resulting in a net reduction in momentum along the direction of the laser beam. Having carefully selected the trap parameters, many cycles of absorption and re-emission will bring the system to the Lamb-Dicke regime, leaving the ions in a string-of-pearls geometry. In order to Doppler cool the ions, the demands on the power and linewidth of the 397 nm laser are modest. The saturation intensity of Ca+ ions is  10 mW/cm2 , and the laser linewidth must be less than  10 MHz. An optogalvonic signal obtained with a hollow cathode lamp suffices to set the frequency. We use a Titanium:Sapphire (Ti:Sapphire) laser (Coherent CR 899-21) with an internal frequency doubling crystal to produce the 397 nm light. During the Doppler cooling, the ions may decay from the 4 2 P1/2 state to the 3 2 D3/2 state, whose lifetime is  1sec. To empty this metastable state, we use a 29

second Ti:Sapphire laser at 866 nm. Once the string of ions is Doppler cooled to the Lamb-Dicke regime, the second stage of optical cooling, sideband cooling, will be used to reduce the collective motion of the string of ions to its lowest vibrational level [70], illustrated in fig. (9.b). In this regime, a narrow optical transition, such as the 732 nm 4 2 S1/2 - 3 2D3/2 dipole forbidden transition, develops sidebands above and below the central frequency by the vibrational frequencies of the ions. The sidebands closest to the unperturbed frequency correspond to the CM vibrational motion. If 0 is the optical transition frequency and x the frequency of the CM vibrational motion, the phonon number is increased by one, unchanged, or decreased by one if an ion absorbs a photon of frequency 0 + x , 0 or 0 -x , respectively. Thus, sideband cooling is accomplished by optically cooling the string of ions with a laser tuned to 0 - x . The need to resolve the sidebands of the transition implies a much more stringent requirement for the laser linewidth; it must be well below the CM mode vibrational frequency of  (2) × 200 kHz. The laser power must also be greater in order to pump the forbidden transition. We plan to use a Ti:Sapphire laser locked to a reference cavity to meet the required linewidth and power. At first glance it would seem that, with a metastable level with a lifetime of 1s, no more than 1 phonon per second could be removed from a trapped ion. A second laser at 866 nm is used to couple the 4 2 P1/2 state to the 3 2 D3/2 state to reduce the effective lifetime of the D state and allow faster cooling times. The transitions required for realization of quantum logic gates and for readout, discussed in detail in sections 5.2 and 5.3, are shown in fig.(9.c). These can be performed with the same lasers used in the Doppler and sideband cooling procedures. There are two other considerations concerning the laser systems for quantum computation which should be mentioned. To reduce the total complexity of the completed system, we are developing diode lasers and a frequency doubling cavity to handle the Doppler cooling and quantum jump read out. Also complex quantum computations would require that the laser on the 4 2 S1/2 - 3 2 P5/2 computation transition have a coherence time as long as the computation time. This may necessitate using qubits bridged by Raman transitions as discussed above, which eliminates the errors caused by the phase drift of the laser.

Qubit Addressing Optics

In order for the Ca+ ion qubits to be useful for actual calculations, it will be necessary to address the ions in a very controlled fashion. Our optical system for qubit addressing 30

is shown schematically in fig. 10. There are two aspects to be considered in the design of such a system: the precise interactions with a single ion; and an arrangement for switching between different ions in the string. In addition to the obvious constraints on laser frequency and polarization, the primary consideration for making exact - or 2-pulses is control of the area (over time) of the driving light field pulse. The first step toward this is to stabilize the intensity of the laser, as can be done to better than 0.1%, using a standard "noise-eater". Such a device typically consists of an electro-optical polarization rotator located between two polarizers; the output of a fast detector monitoring part of the transmitted beam is used in a feedback circuit to adjust the degree of polarization rotation, and thus the intensity of the transmitted light. Switching the light beam on and off can be performed with a similar (or even the same) device. Because such switches can possess rise/fall times on the scale of nanoseconds, it should be possible to readily control the area under the pulse to within  0.1%, simply by accurately determining the width of the pulse. A more elaborate scheme would involve an integrating detector, which would monitor the actual integrated energy under the pulse, shutting the pulse off when the desired value is obtained. Once the controls for addressing a single ion are decided, the means for switching between ions must be considered. Any system for achieving this must be fast, reproducible, display very precise aiming and low "crosstalk" (i.e. overlap of the focal spot onto more than one ion), and be as simple as possible. In particular, it is desirable to be able to switch between different ions in the string in a time short compared to the time required to complete a given -pulse on one ion. This tends to discount any sort of mechanical scanning system. Acousto-optic deflectors, which are often used for similar purposes, may be made fast enough, but introduce unwanted frequency shifts on the deviated beams. As a tentative solution, we propose to use an electro-optic beam deflector, basically a prism whose index of refraction, and consequently whose deflection angle, is varied slightly by applying a high voltage across the material; typical switching times for these devices is 10 nanoseconds, adequate for our purposes9 . One such device produces a maximum deflection of ±9 mrad, for a ±3000V input. The associated maximum number of resolvable spots (using the Rayleigh criterion) is of order 100, implying that  20 ions could be comfortably resolved with negligible crosstalk. After the inter-ion spacing has been determined, i.e., by the trap frequencies, the
Note that while one could in principle control the pulse area merely by swinging the pulse on and off a given ion, the complications involved with exposing the ion to a varying spatial distribution make this undesirable.

crosstalk specification determines the maximum spot size of the addressing beam. For example, for an ion spacing of 20 µm, any spot size (defined here as the 1/e2 diameter) less than 21.6 µm will yield a crosstalk of less than 0.1%, assuming a purely Gaussian intensity distribution (a good approximation if the light is delivered from a singlemode optical fiber, or through an appropriate spatial filter). In practice, scattering and other experimental realities will increase this size, so that it is prudent to aim for a somewhat smaller spot size, e.g. 10 µm. One consideration when such small spot sizes are required is the effect of lens aberrations, especially since the spot must remain small regardless of which ion it is deflected on. Employing standard ray-trace methods, we have found that the blurring effects of aberrations can be reduced if a doublet/meniscus lens combination (figs.11.a) is used (assuming an input beam size of 3mm, and an effective focal length of 30mm). A further complication is that, in order to add or remove phonons from the system, the addressing beams must have a component along the longitudinal axis of the trap. Calculations indicate that an angle of only about 10o between the pump beam and the normal to the ion string is sufficient for adequate coupling to the phonons. Nevertheless the addressing optics must accommodate a tilted line of focus, otherwise the intensity at each ion would be markedly different, and the crosstalk for the outermost ions would become unacceptable. According to ray-trace calculations, adding a simple wedge (of  2o ) solves the problem (see Figs.11.b) and this has been confirmed by measurements using the mock system (Fig.11.c). Depending on the exact level scheme being considered, it may be necessary to vary the polarization of the light (e.g., from left- to right-circularly polarized). Because the electro-optic deflector requires a specific linear polarization, any polarization-control elements should be placed after the deflector (see, for example, Fig. 10). The final result is a highly directional, tightly-focused beam with controllable polarization and intensity.

6.5

Imaging System

In order to determine the ions' locations and to readout the result of the quantum computations, an imaging system is required. Figure 12 shows our current imaging system, which consists of two lenses, one of which is mounted inside the vacuum chamber, and a video camera coupled to a dual-stage micro-channel plate (MCP) image intensifier. The first lens with focal length 15 mm collects the light emitted from the central trap region with a solid angle of approximately 0.25 sr. The image is relayed through a 110mm/f2 commercial camera lens to the front plate of the MCP. This set32

up produces a magnification of 7.5 at the input of the MCP. The input of the 110 mm lens is fitted with a 400nm narrow band filter to reduce background from the IR laser and from light emanating from the hot calcium oven and the electron gun filament. The dual plate intensifier is operated at maximum gain for the highest possible sensitivity. This allows us to read out the camera at normal video rate of 30 frames s-1 into a data acquisition computer. Averaging and integrating of the signal over a given time period can then be undertaken by software. We find this arrangement extremely useful in enabling us to observe changes of the cloud size or the intensity of the fluorescence with changes of external parameters like trapping potential, laser frequency, laser amplitude, etc. in real time. The spatial resolution of the system is limited by the active diameter of individual channels of the MCP of approximately 12 µm. Since the gain is run at its maximum value cross talk between adjacent channels in the transition between the first and second stage is to be expected. This results in the requirement that two incoming photons can only be resolved when they are separated at the input of the MCP by at least two channels, i.e. by 36 µm in our case. With the magnification of the optical system of 7.5 this translates into a minimum separation of two ions to be resolved of 5 µm, which is well below the separation of ions in the axial well of about 25 µm expected in our experiment.

Summary and Conclusions

It is our contention that currently the ion trap proposal for realizing a practical quantum computer offers the best chance of long term success. This in no way is intended to trivialize research into the other proposals discussed in section 4: in any of these schemes technological advances may at some stage lead to a breakthrough. In particular, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance does seem to be a relatively straightforward way in which to achieve systems containing a few qubits. However, of the technologies which have so far been used to demonstrate experimental logic gates, ion traps seem to offer the least number of technological problems for scaling up to 10's or even 100's of qubits. In this paper we have described in some detail the experiment we are currently developing to investigate the feasibility of cold trapped ion quantum computation. We should emphasize that our intentions are at the moment exploratory: we have chosen an ion on the basis of current laser technology, rather than on the basis of which ion which will give the best performance for the quantum computer. Other species of ion may

33

well give better performance: In particular, as mentioned in section 5, Beryllium ions do have the potential for a significantly lower error rate due to spontaneous emission, although it is also true that lighter ions may be more susceptible to heating. Other variations, such as the use of Raman transitions in place of single laser transitions, or the use of standing wave lasers need to be investigated. Our choice of Calcium will allow us to explore these issues. Furthermore, calculations suggest that it should be possible to trap 20 or more Calcium ions in a linear configuration and manipulate their quantum states by lasers on short enough time scales that many quantum logic operations may be performed before coherence is lost. Only by experiment can the theoretical estimates of performance be confirmed. Until all of the sources of experimental error in real devices are thoroughly investigated, it will be impossible to determine what ion and addressing scheme enables one to build the best quantum computer or, indeed, whether it is possible to build a useful quantum computer with cold trap ions at all.

Is the Deformation Parameter in q-Rotor Model Really Phenomenological ?
Ramandeep S. Johal, Department of Physics, Panjab University, Chandigarh - 160014, India.

Abstract We cast the q-rotor in the framework of Barnett-Pegg theory for rotation angle, whose underlying algebra is SUq (2). A new method to fix the deformation parameter from the theory is suggested. We test our ideas by fitting rotational spectra in deformed even-even and superdeformed nuclei. The results are in good agreement with the previous phenomenological applications of q-rotor model.

1

In recent years, quantum algebras have been extensively applied in nuclear physics ( for a review, see ref. [1]). In particular, quantum algebra SUq (2) has been used in describing the rotational spectra of deformed even-even nuclei [2] and superdeformed nuclei [3]. The basic model adopted in these studies is q-rotor, whose hamiltonian is written in terms of second order casimir of SUq (2) . Using this model, improved fits are obtained for the rotational spectra. But the approach has been mainly phenomenological, where SUq (2) dynamical symmetry of the system was rather assumed. In any case, some physical significance could always be ascribed to the deformation parameter. For example, q has been related to the softness parameter of variable moment of inertia model [4]. On a different side, a few years back, Pegg and Barnett proposed a solution to the long standing phase operator problem of quantum harmonic oscillator [5]. A similar formalism also exists for the rotation angle operator [6]. However, although much work has been done related to phase operartor for electromagnetic fields [7,8], very little has been discussed regarding the rotation angle described in this formalism. A major reason for this indifference appears to be that `angular velocity' was ill-defined in this framework [9]. Recently, two new solutions have been suggested to remove this malady [10,11]. So in our opinion, Barnett-Pegg (BP) formalism is a valid approach to the theory of rotation angle in quantum mechanics. In this letter, we seek a theoretical basis for q-rotor model. The underlying framework for our theory is BP formalism. Very briefly, in this formalism, a complete set of orthogonal angle states is defined in (2l + 1)-Hilbert, |n = 
l 1 exp(-imn )|m 2l + 1 m=-l

(1)

2n where n = 0 + 2l+1 (n = 0, 1, .., 2l). m is the eigenvalue of Jz , component of angular momentum along z-axis. The unitary operator 2l

exp(±i) = exp(±i
n=0

n |n n |)

(2)

corresponds to the hermitian angle operator, . It can be said that the above formalism 2 has inherent q-deformed structure [10], if we identify q = exp(-i 2l+1 ). Then the operators h q Jz /¯ and ei satisfy h h q Jz /¯ ei = q ei q Jz /¯ (3) which is the quantum plane condition in the discrete angular momentum-angle phase space [12]. These operators show cyclic displacement property ei |m = |m + 1 2 (4)

h e-i is the lowering operator in this representation. Operator q Jz /¯ has analogus action on |n states. All this implies a periodic lattice structure, the lattice constant being related to the deformation parameter. It has been suggested [13] quite generally, that whenever there is an underlying lattice or presence of discrete lengths in the system, the related algebraic structure is a q-deformed one. Thus we note that the algebra of operators in BP-formalism is q-deformed angular momentum algebra or briefly, SUq (2), with q as root of unity. For the purpose of q-rotor, it is essential to study the full set of generators of SUq (2). The algebra is given by the following commutation relations

ei |l = ei(2l+1)0 | - l .

(5)

[J+ , J- ] = [2Jz ] = [Jz , J± ] = ±J±

q 2Jz - q -2Jz , q - q -1

(6) (7)

The operators act on the subspace spanned by angular momentum eigenstates |jm , where the representation label j is very less than l, which denotes the full space. Now for each value of j, operators J± act only on |jm (m = -j, -j + 1, ...., j). They do not mix eigenstates with different values of j. Thus each complete set of |jm states, serves as a basis for a (2j + 1)-irrep for SUq (2). The action of J± is given by J± |jm Jz |jm = h{[j  m][j ± m + 1]}1/2 |jm ± 1 ¯ = m¯ |jm . h (8) (9)

The second order casimir of this algebra is C2 (SUq (2)) = [Jz ][Jz + 1] + J- J+ , with eigenvalues C2 (SUq (2))|jm = [j][j + 1]|jm . (11) Now consider a set of states, each labelled by a different value of j, ranging from jmin to jmax , and incresing in equal steps. This is our system. Question is, how much large the total space with dimension (2l + 1) be ? BP theory requires [6] that for physical states it is finite but may be arbitrarily large, such that l  j. We try to set the lower bound for the (2l + 1) value. A natural way is to demand that the total hilbert space be sufficiently large to contain all the (2j + 1) irreps of the system. More precisely, we set
jmax

(10)

2l + 1 =
jmin

(2j + 1).

(12)

If the above sum is even, then (2l + 1) value is the next odd number. Remember that we are guessing the minimum size of the total space and in this way, maximally fix the deformation parameter from the theory. In short we suggest that the size (scale) of the embedding space is determined by the sum total of dimensions of the contained irreps. (See also the remark after eq. (15). Now we turn to the q-rotor model. The hamiltonian is given by Hq = 1 C2 (SUq (2)), 2I (13)

where I is the moment of inertia. The energy of a state labelled by quantum number j is then Ej = 1 [j][j + 1] 2I 1 sin ( j)sin ( (j + 1)) = 2I sin2 ( )

(14)

2 where  = 2l+1 and (2l + 1) is determined from eq. (12). We apply the above ideas to rotational spectra in deformed even-even nuclei and superdeformed nuclei. We have fitted the parameter A = 1/2I in eq. (14) for some nuclei and the results are tabulated in table 1. The improvement of fits over the classical j(j +1) formula is indicated by the decrease in the quantity jmax

2 =
jmin

{exp(j) - theo(j)}2 .

(15)

Before discussing the results, a remark is in place. In the standard BP aprroach, after the physical quantities have been calculated, l is made to go to infinity. This is necessary, because only in the semiclassical limit of large angular momentum, the phase operator becomes continuous. However, we argue that q-rotor is discussed in angular momentum representaion and we make no attempt to determine physical quantities in terms of . Thus the angle eigenvalues remain indeterminate. Secondly, the square bracket [j], which generally can also take negative values for q root of unity, always remains positive here. This is because of l  j. It is observed that in general, there is significant decrease in root mean square deviation showing good improvement of results over the ordinary rotor (for 238 U, the classical rms deviation is about 250). The most interesting observation is that for deformed even-even 4

nuclei,  assumes values around 0.03. This was also found in [2], where  was treated as fitting parameter. The fitted parameter A = 1/2I also assumes similar close values. In the case of superdeformed nuclei,  assumes still smaller values. In 130 mass region,   0.01. For 150 mass region,   0.004. Both these results match with the phenomenological findings of [3]. In 190 mass region,  is in between the above two values. Thus on the average, there is a monotonic decrease of  in different mass regions with increase of superdeformation. Also it has been found on phenomenological basis [2,3], that for one deformation parameter fitting of q-rotor, only q = ei and not q = e can give improved fitting of the data. q-parameter inbuilt in the BP approach is already pure phase (modulus unity) and so it is suitable for describing the q-rotor. Concluding, we have studied q-rotor within Barnett-Pegg approach. In the present work, a method to fix the deformation parameter a priori from the theory has been suggested. We have applied the idea to describe rotational spectra in deformed even-even and superdeformed nuclei. The results are quite close to those of previous phenomenological approaches to the q-rotor problem. Attempt is underway to understand in a similar vein, the rotational molecular spectra. One may look forward to describe excited collective - and - bands of even deformed nuclei starting from the above theory. However, as pointed out in [15], alone SUq (2) symmetry may not be sufficient as these excited bands involve non-rotational degrees of freedom also. It may be possible to formulate phase theories more general than BP theory, which would incorporate deformed symmetries other than SUq (2).

Complete separability of a class of nonlinear Schr¨dinger o and Liouville-von Neumann equations

Narutowicza 11/12, 80-952 Gda´sk, Poland n n and Arnold Sommerfeld Institute for Mathematical Physics Technical University of Clausthal, D-38678 Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany A general method for extending a non-dissipative nonlinear Schr¨dinger and Liouville-von Neuo mann 1-particle dynamics to an arbitrary number of particles is described. It is shown at a general level that the dynamics so obtained is completely separable, which is the strongest condition one can impose on dynamics of composite systems. It requires that for all initial states (entangled or not) a subsystem not only cannot be influenced by any action undertaken by an observer in a separated system (strong separability), but additionally that the self-consistency condition Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 1+2 1 is fulfilled. It is shown that a correct extension to N particles involves integro-differential equations which, in spite of their nonlocal appearance, make the theory fully local. As a consequence a much larger class of nonlinearities satisfying the complete separability condition is allowed than has been assumed so far. In particular all nonlinearities of the form F (|(x)|) are acceptable. The only exception to the rule I managed to find is the Kostin equation. PACS numbers: 03.65.Bz, 03.75.Fi, 05.30.-d, 11.10.Lm

In spite of linearity of the Schr¨dinger and Liouvilleo von Neumann equations, nonlinearly evolving states are encountered in quantum mechanics quite often. Typically this is a result of approximations used in a description of collective phenomena (cf. nonlinear interferences in a Bose-Einstein condensate [1]) but no proof has been given so far that it is not the linearity that is a result of some approximation. This obvious observation motivated many authors to either look for nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics, or to try to find an argument against a nonlinear evolution at a fundamental level. A privileged role in both cases was played by a separability condition. Apparently the first use of the condition can be found in [2]. The authors required that a nonlinearity must allow two separated, noninteracting and uncorrelated subsystems to evolve independently of each other, and this (plus some additional assumptions) led them to the nonlinear term ln |(x)| (x). Similar argument (with different additional assumptions) led Haag and Banier [3] and Weinberg [4] to the 1-homogeneity condition (i.e. (x) and (x) should satisfy the same equation). An important element of these works was the assumption that the systems are uncorrelated, that is their wave function is a product one. Equations that have such a locality property may be called weakly separable. It was shown later by Gisin and others [4,7­9] that a weakly separable equation may still violate causality if an initial state of the composite system is entangled. A slightly different in spirit analysis of separability conditions was given in [10] where it was argued that an extension from 1 to N particles may lead to new effects that become visible for N > N0 , where N0 is a parameter characterizing a given hierarchy of theories. 1

It was originally conjectured that these properties refute any deterministic (i.e. non-stochastic) nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics. That this is not the case was shown for Weinberg-type quantum mechanics by Polchinski [11] (for pure states) and Jordan [12] (for density matrices). These results were subsequently generalized to a more general class of theories (Lie-Nambu dynamics) by myself in [13]. Therefore, contrary to a rather common belief, there exists a class of nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics that does not lead to the locality problems for general (pure-entangled and general-mixed) states. Such theories can be called strongly separable. The strongly separable theories considered so far involve equations which are Hamiltonian, which means there exists a Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics. Actually, the solution of the problem proposed by Polchinski in [11] was based on an appropriate choice of this function. Still, there exists an interesting class of nonlinear equations that are not Hamiltonian. For example, it is known that all DoebnerGoldin equations that are Hamiltonian are linearizable [14] and therefore their strong separability may not be very interesting. Quite recently the problem of strong separability of non-Hamiltonian Doebner-Goldin equations was addressed in [15]. Using the typical extension of the dynamics from 1 to N particles the authors showed that at t = 0 the time derivatives (up to the 3rd order) of a 1-particle probability density in position space do not depend on the potential applied to the other particle if the equation is Galilean-covariant. This suggests that Galilean covariance may lead to strong locality in nonrelativistic domain. The result agrees with computer algebraic tests undertaken by Werner [16] who chose oscillator-type potentials and wave functions satisfying certain Gaussian Ansatz. A technical detail that did not allow these authors to find a general solution was that they investigated a dynamics of diagonal elements of a non-pure reduced density matrix (typical of entangled states) but the formalism they used was devised for state vectors and, hence, they had no control over the behavior of non-pure states [17]. In this Letter I will give a general and model independent solution of the problem. I will generalize to nonHamiltonian systems the technique that proved so powerful in the context of density matrix equations, namely the triple-bracket formalism [13,20]. I will then show how to extend a 1-particle dynamics to N -particle systems in a strongly separable way for a large class of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian Schr¨dinger non-dissipative o equations. As opposed to basically all previous papers dealing with pure state nonlinear dynamics (the exception is [11], but it deals with finite dimensional systems) I will not guess the "obvious" form of the extension but will derive it. This somewhat long path beginning with pure states, then extension via mixtures, and again back to pure states, will be rewarded because the N -particle form we will get will not be the one one might expect. The approach is applicable to all non2

dissipative Doebner-Goldin equations which are covariant under time-independent nonlinear gauge transformations [5,6], the equations discussed in [2­4,21], as well as a large class of nonlinear Schr¨dinger equations that were o not discussed so far. Surprisingly, the Kostin equation [22] is not in this class. This equation is of the DoebnerGoldin type if time-dependent gauge transformations are involved [5]. This shows incidentally that nonlinear gauge transformations have to be reexamined from the point of view of separability. I will prove simultanously a much stronger result. By the very construction the formalism is applicable to those Liouville-von Neumann nonlinear equations that reduce to the corresponding nonlinear Schr¨dinger dynamics on o pure states. All these equations will be shown to be not only strongly separable but also completely separable. By the latter I mean a strongly separable dynamics which additionally satisfies the self-consistency condition Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 , 1+2 1 (1)

where t and t denote the dynamics of the composite 1+2 1 system and the subsystem, respectively, and the partial trace Tr 2 is a map that reduces the dynamics from the large system to the subsystem. Condition (1), which is independent of strong separability, was recently pointed out as an important ingredient of nonlinear dynamics that may be regarded as completely positive [23]. We will also see that not only the probability densities in position space but also the off-diagonal elements of reduced density matrices are independedent of details of interaction in the remote systems. The general convention I will use was elaborated in detail in [13,24] but to make this work self-contained let us first explain the general scheme on a concrete example, the Haag-Banier equation [3]: i¯ t (a) = - h ¯ ¯ (a)a (a) - (a)a (a) h ¯2 (a). (2) a + V (a) (a) + A(a) ¯ 2m 2i(a)(a)

Its Liouville-von Neumann counterpart is i¯ t (a, a ) = - h dy (a - y)a [(a, y) - (y, a)] h ¯2 a + V (a) (a, a ) + A(a) (a, a ) 2m 2i(a, a) dy (a - y)a [(a , y) - (y, a )] h ¯2 a + V (a ) (a, a ) - A(a ) (a, a ), (3) 2m 2i(a , a )

where (a, a ) = (a , a) and f (a) = (a, a) is d3 a-squareintegrable [25]. For (a, a ) = (a)(a ) (3) reduces to the Schr¨dinger-Haag-Banier dynamics. Using the como posite index convention described in [13] we can write the equation in a form which is compact and simplifies general calculations. Denote a = (a, a ) and H a () = H(a , a) = K(a , a) + V (a)(a - a ) + A(a) The kinetic kernel satisfies 3 dy (a - y)a [(a, y) - (y, a)] (a - a )H a (). (4) 2i(a, a)

and K(a, b) = K(b, a). All the integrals are in R3 i.e. da = d3 a, etc., and the "summmation convention" is applied at the composite index level (two repeated indices are inegrated). There is no conflict of notation here because the composite indices are always in their upper or lower positions whereas the 3-dimensional coordinates a are arguments of functions or distributions. (Notice that the composite indices correspond always to pairs of primed and unprimed 3-dimensional coordinates.) The indices are raised by the metric g ab working as follows g ab b = dbdb (a - b )(b - a )(b, b ) = (a , a) = a .

So if a = (a, a ) then a = (a , a). To lower an index one uses obvious inverse formulas [13]. The Liouville-von Neumann equation can be written in a triple-bracket-type form [13,26] i¯ t f = h dbdb dcdc (f - b )(b - c )(c - f  ) - (f - c )(b - f  )(c - b ) H(b , b) (c , c) (6)

then (7) describes a Lie-Poisson dynamics of a density matrix [27]. If no Hamiltonian function H satisfying (8) exists, the dynamics will be called almost-Lie-Poisson. The generic case discussed in this Letter is almost-LiePoisson. The Weinberg-type and mean-field dynamics discussed in [12,27] are Lie-Poisson. The discussion presented here applies to a general almost-Lie-Poisson dynamics where the structure constants have the following general form [13] abc = I  I  I - I  I I

Here  a = (a - a ), Ia = (a - a ) but (9) and (10) are valid also for other Hilbert spaces and equations (cf. [13,24]). Consider now a 2-particle system described by the density matrix which, depending on whether the state is pure or general, is in either of the two forms a = a1 a2 = (a1 , a2 , a , a ) 1 2

holding for all N -particle structure constants and reduced density matrices of non-overlapping subsystems (for the proof of (22) see Lemma 1 in [13]). Let me summarize what has happened until now: Using a correct extension of a 1-particle nonlinear Hamiltonian operator and the general property of triple brackets 5

we have reduced a 2-particle equation for a 2-particle density matrix to a 1-particle equation which involves only the quantities which are intrinsic to this subsystem. All elements depending on the other subsystem have simply vanished. We have obtained this by performing only one operation -- the partial trace over the "external" subsystem. Therefore the reduced density matrix in I does not depend on details of interaction in the separated system II and the dynamics is strongly separable. Actually, we have simultaneously obtained more. Indeed, we do not assume that we take the partial trace at "t = 0". Therefore we can trace out the external system at any time and the reduced dynamics is indistinguishable from a dynamics defined entirely in terms of the subsystem and starting from the initial condition 1 (0) = I (0) = Tr 2 (0) where (0) is the initial condition for the large system. It proves that the dynamics so constructed is completely separable. The construction beginning with (16) and (19) can be used to prove that it is in fact possible to perform an embedding in stages. So the index b in (16) can involve an arbitrary number of particles. The same concerns the two reduced density matrices provided the subsystems do not overlap. This is guaranteed by the generality of (22) which holds for all nonoverlapping subsystems. The result we have obtained is completely general and works for all Schr¨dinger equations whose o nonlinear Hamiltonian operator kernels allow to write them in terms of 1-particle density matrices. Putting it differently, the construction works correctly if a given Schr¨dinger equation allows for an extension to o an almost-Lie-Poisson Liouville-von Neumann equation. The example of the Haag-Banier equation served only as means of focusing our attention and making the discussion less abstract. So how does the 2-particle equation look explicitly? Beginning again with the general formula we can obtain immediately its model independent form just by performing abstract operations on the composite indices. We get
b2 b i¯ t a = abc HI 1 (I ) b2 +  b1 HII (II ) c h b b2 = a1 b1 c1 HI 1 (I )c1 a2 + a2 b2 c2 HII (II )a1 c2 . (1) (1) (2)

Returning for the sake of completeness to the HaagBanier case we can write it as i¯ t (a1 , a2 , a , a ) h 1 2 = - h ¯2 a1 + a2 - a - a + V1 (a1 ) + V2 (a2 ) - V1 (a ) - V2 (a ) 1 2 1 2 2m dy1 (a1 - y1 )a1 [ dz (a1 , z, y1 , z) - 2i dz (a1 , z, a1 , z) dy2 (a2 - y2 )a2 [ dz (z, a2 , z, y2 ) - 2i dz (z, a2 , z, a2 ) dz (y1 , z, a1 , z)] dz (z, y2 , z, a2 )]

This equation has several interesting features. The Hamiltonian operator obviously reduces to the sum of ordinary 1-particle terms, involving no integrals, if  is a product state. What makes it unusual is the presence of the integrals. Typically it is said that such equations should not be taken into account because they are nonlocal . They indeed appear nonlocal but a closer look shows that it is in fact just the opposite: The currents and probability densities are the local 1-particle ones. Therefore it is the lack of appropriate inegrals that makes typical 2particle equations nonlocal. The equation considered in [15] involved no such integrals and this led to difficulties. An extension of the above results from 2 to N particles is immediate so we I not give the explicit formulas. Let me now list some of nonlinear Hamiltonian operators that have been considered in literature and which admit the completely separable extension to an arbitrary number of particles in arbitrary entangled and mixed states. The general rule is that an extension to N particles will be given in one of these forms but instead of (x, x ) a reduced 1-particle density matrix should be placed. If the N -particle state is pure then the reduced density matrix is a functional of the pure state which involves N - 1 integrations. This operator is subsequently put into a suitable place in the Schr¨dinger equation. o Similarly it can be put into a Liouville-von Neumann equation if the state is more general. a) "Nonlinear Schr¨dinger" o |(x)|2  (x, x) b) Bialynicki-Birula­Mycielski ln |(x)|2  ln (x, x) Obviously in the same way one can treat any equation with nonlinearities given by some function F (|(x)|) [29]. c) Doebner­Goldin R1 : ¯ ¯ 1 (x)x (x) - (x)x (x) ¯ 2i (x)(x) 7

I. INTRODUCTION

In spite of the linearity of the Schr¨dinger and Liouville-von Neumann equations, nonlinearly evolving states are o encountered in quantum mechanics quite often. Typically this is a result of approximations used in a description of collective phenomena (cf. nonlinear interferences in a Bose-Einstein condensate [1]) but no proof has been given so far that it is not the linearity that is a result of some approximation. This obvious observation motivated many authors to either look for nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics, or to try to find an argument against a nonlinear evolution at a fundamental level. A privileged role in both cases was played by a separability condition. Apparently the first use of the condition can be found in [2]. The authors required that a nonlinearity must allow two separated, noninteracting and uncorrelated subsystems to evolve independently of each other, and this (plus some additional assumptions) led them to the nonlinear term ln |(x)| (x). Similar argument (with different additional assumptions) led Haag and Bannier [3] and Weinberg [4] to the 1-homogeneity condition (i.e. (x) and (x) should satisfy the same equation). An important element of these works was the assumption that the systems are uncorrelated, that is their wave function is a product one. Equations that have such a locality property may be called weakly separable [5]. It was shown later by Gisin and others [4,8­10] that a weakly separable equation may still violate causality if an initial state of the composite system is entangled. A slightly different in spirit analysis of separability conditions was given in [11] where it was argued that an extension from 1 to N particles may lead to new effects that become visible for N > N0 , where N0 is a parameter characterizing a given hierarchy of theories. It was originally conjectured that these properties refute any deterministic (i.e. non-stochastic) nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics. That this is not the case was shown for Weinberg-type quantum mechanics by Polchinski [12] (for pure states) and Jordan [13] (for density matrices). These results were subsequently generalized to a more general class of theories (Lie-Nambu dynamics) by myself in [14]. Therefore, contrary to a rather common belief, there exists a class of nonlinear generalizations of quantum mechanics that does not lead to the locality problems for general (pure-entangled and general-mixed) states. Such theories can be called strongly separable. The strongly separable theories considered so far involve equations which are Hamiltonian, which means there exists a Hamiltonian function that generates the dynamics. Actually, the solution of the problem proposed by Polchinski in [12] was based on an appropriate choice of this function. In addition, the Polchinski approach was formulated within a finite-dimensional framework. Still, there exists an interesting class of non-Hamiltonian and infinite-dimensional nonlinear equations. For example, it is known that all Doebner-Goldin equations that are Hamiltonian are linearizable [15] and therefore their strong separability may not be very interesting. Quite recently the problem of strong separability of non-Hamiltonian Doebner-Goldin equations was addressed in [16]. Using the typical extension of the dynamics from 1 to N particles the authors showed that at t = 0 the time derivatives (up to the 3rd order) of a 1-particle probability density in position space do not depend on the potential applied to the other particle if the 1

equation is Galilean-covariant. This suggests that Galilean covariance may lead to strong locality in nonrelativistic domain. The result agrees with computer algebraic tests undertaken by Werner [17] who chose oscillator-type potentials and wave functions satisfying certain Gaussian Ansatz. The approach chosen in those works is essentially a third order perturbation theory applied to diagonal elements of reduced density matrices. A technical detail that did not allow these authors to find a general non-perturbative solution was that they investigated a dynamics of diagonal elements of a non-pure reduced density matrix (typical of entangled states) but the formalism they used was devised for state vectors and, hence, they had no control over the behavior of non-pure states and off-diagonal elements of density matrices [18]. In this paper I will give a general and model independent solution of the problem. I will generalize to nonHamiltonian systems the technique that proved useful in the context of density matrix equations, namely the triplebracket formalism [14,21]. I will then show how to extend a 1-particle dynamics to N -particle systems in a strongly separable way for a large class of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian Schr¨dinger non-dissipative equations. As o opposed to basically all previous papers dealing with pure state nonlinear dynamics (the exception is [12], but it deals with finite dimensional systems) I will not guess the "obvious" form of the extension but will derive it. This somewhat long path beginning with pure states, then extension via mixtures, and again back to pure states, will be rewarded because the N -particle form we will get will not be the one one might expect. Its paricularly interesting feature is the fact that the equations are integro-differential . This feature is implicitly present also in the Polchinski-Jordan formalism but is hidden behind the finite dimensional convention where the integrals do not explicitly show up. The approach is applicable to all non-dissipative Doebner-Goldin equations [6,7], the equations discussed in [2­4,22], as well as a large class of nonlinear Schr¨dinger equations that were not discussed so far. o I will prove simultanously a much stronger result. By the very construction the formalism is applicable to those Liouville-von Neumann nonlinear equations that reduce to the corresponding nonlinear Schr¨dinger dynamics on pure o states. All these equations will be shown to be not only strongly separable but also completely separable. By the latter I mean a strongly separable dynamics which additionally satisfies the self-consistency condition Tr 2  t = t  Tr 2 , 1+2 1 (1)

t where t 1+2 and 1 denote the dynamics of the composite system and the subsystem, respectively, and the partial trace Tr 2 is a map that reduces the dynamics from the large system to the subsystem. Condition (1), which is independent of strong separability, was recently pointed out as an important ingredient of nonlinear dynamics that may be regarded as completely positive [23]. We will also see that not only the probability densities in position space but also the off-diagonal elements of reduced density matrices are independedent of details of interaction in the remote systems.

II. EXAMPLE: HAAG-BANNIER EQUATION AND ITS ALMOST-LIE-POISSON FORM

The general convention I will use was elaborated in detail in [14,24] but to make this work self-contained let us first explain the general scheme on a concrete example, the Haag-Bannier equation [3]. This equation is of the Doebner-Goldin type, that is contains a 1-homogeneous nonlinear term with derivatives, but is simpler: i¯ t (a) = - h ¯ ¯ h ¯2 (a)a (a) - (a)a (a) (a). a + V (a) (a) + A(a) 2m 2i|(a)|2 (2)

Its Liouville-von Neumann counterpart is i¯ t (a, a ) = - h dy (a - y)a [(a, y) - (y, a)] h ¯2 a + V (a) (a, a ) + A(a) (a, a ) 2m 2i(a, a) dy (a - y)a [(a , y) - (y, a )] h ¯2 a + V (a ) (a, a ) - A(a ) (a, a ), 2m 2i(a , a ) (3)

- -

where (a, a ) = (a , a), and f (a) = (a, a)  0 is d3 a-integrable [25] together with all its natural powers f (a)n . For o (a, a ) = (a)(a ) (3) reduces to the Schr¨dinger-Haag-Bannier dynamics. Using the composite index convention described in [14] we can write the equation in a form which is compact and simplifies general calculations. Denote a = (a, a ) and H a () = H(a , a) = K(a , a) + V (a)(a - a ) + A(a) dy (a - y)a [(a, y) - (y, a)] (a - a ). 2i(a, a) (4)

2

The kinetic kernel satisfies dy K(a, y)(y, a ) = - h ¯2 a (a, a ), 2m (5)

and K(a, b) = K(b, a). All the integrals are in R3 i.e. da = d3 a, etc., and the "summmation convention" is applied at the composite index level (two repeated indices are inegrated). There is no conflict of notation here because the composite indices are always in their upper or lower positions whereas the 3-dimensional coordinates a are arguments of functions or distributions. (Notice that the composite indices correspond always to pairs of primed and unprimed 3-dimensional coordinates.) The indices are raised by the metric g ab working as follows g ab b = dbdb (a - b )(b - a )(b, b ) = (a , a) = a .

So if a = (a, a ) then a = (a , a). To lower an index one uses obvious inverse formulas [14]. The Liouville-von Neumann equation can be written in a triple-bracket-type form [14,26,27] i¯ t f = h dbdb dcdc (f - b )(b - c )(c - f  ) - (f - c )(b - f  )(c - b ) H(b , b) (c , c)

then (7) describes a Lie-Poisson dynamics of a density matrix [28]. If no Hamiltonian function H satisfying (8) exists, the dynamics will be called almost-Lie-Poisson. The generic case discussed in this Letter is almost-Lie-Poisson. The Weinberg-type and mean-field dynamics discussed in [13,28] are Lie-Poisson. The discussion presented here applies to a general almost-Lie-Poisson dynamics where the structure constants have the following general form [14] abc = I  I  I - I  I I

where   =  a and I = Ia are, respectively, the symplectic form and the Poisson tensor corresponding to the pure state equation. Here  a = (a - a ), Ia = (a - a ) but (9) and (10) are valid also for other Hilbert spaces and equations (cf. [14,24]).

III. 2-PARTICLE EXTENSION

Consider now a 2-particle system described by the density matrix which, depending on whether the state is pure or general, is in either of the two forms a = a1 a2 = (a1 , a2 , a , a ) 1 2
pure

(11) (12)

The reduced density matrices are I 1 = a II = a2 dy (a1 , y, a , y) =  a2 a1 a2 1 dy (y, a2 , y, a ) =  a1 a1 a2 . 2 (13) (14)

The 2-particle Liouville-von Neumann-Haag-Bannier equation is given by (7) but with all indices doubled like in (11), (12) with the 2-particle structure constants given explicitly by 3

abc = (a1 - b )(b1 - c )(c1 - a ) 1 1 1 ×(a2 - b )(b2 - c )(c2 - a ) 2 2 2 - (a1 - c )(b1 - a )(c1 - b ) 1 1 1 ×(a2 - c )(b2 - a )(c2 - b ). 2 2 2

(2)

(15)

The crucial element of the whole construction is the nonlinear extension of the 1-particle Hamiltonian operator kernel. We define it as
d H b () = HI 1 (I )

I 1 II d d2 + HII (II ) d2 b b

(16) (17)

b2 b = HI 1 (I ) b2 +  b1 HII (II ),

with b = b1 b2 . (16) is a nonlinear functional generalization of the well known linear recipe H1+2 = H1  1+ 1 H2 and reduces to the formulas arising from the triple-bracket formalism if Hamiltonian functions exist. The whole 2-particle equation can be written as follows i¯ t f = abc h
(2)

I II f d d2 HI 1 (I ) d1 + HII (II ) d2 a b b

(18)

where f = f1 f2 is the 2-particle density matrix. Now comes the important general result. Let us perform a partial trace i.e. contract both sides of (18) with  f2 .  Since I 1 =  f2 f1 f2 = If2 f1 f2 and  f2 = (f2 - f2 ) is t- and -independent f i¯ t I 1 h f = abc = abc

holding for all N -particle structure constants and reduced density matrices of non-overlapping subsystems (for the proof of (22) see Lemma 1 in [14]). Let me summarize what has happened until now: Using a correct extension of a 1-particle nonlinear Hamiltonian operator and the general property of triple brackets we have reduced a 2-particle equation for a 2-particle density matrix to a 1-particle equation which involves only the quantities which are intrinsic to this subsystem. All elements depending on the other subsystem have simply vanished. We have obtained this by performing only one operation -- the partial trace over the "external" subsystem. Therefore the reduced density matrix in I does not depend on details of interaction in the separated system II and the dynamics is strongly separable. Actually, we have simultaneously obtained more. Indeed, we do not assume that we take the partial trace at "t = 0". Therefore we can trace out the external system at any time and the reduced dynamics is indistinguishable from a dynamics defined entirely in terms of the subsystem and starting from the initial condition 1 (0) = I (0) = Tr 2 (0) where (0) is the initial condition for the large system. It proves that the dynamics so constructed is completely separable. The result we have obtained is completely general and works for all Schr¨dinger equations whose nonlinear Hamiltoo nian operator kernels allow to write them in terms of 1-particle density matrices. Putting it differently, the construction works correctly if a given Schr¨dinger equation allows for an extension to an almost-Lie-Poisson Liouville-von Neuo mann equation. The example of the Haag-Bannier equation served only as a means of focusing our attention and making the discussion less abstract. So how does the 2-particle equation look explicitly? Beginning again with the general formula we can obtain immediately its model independent form just by performing abstract operations on the composite indices. We get 4

b2 b i¯ t a = abc HI 1 (I ) b2 +  b1 HII (II ) c h b b2 = a1 b1 c1 HI 1 (I )c1 a2 + a2 b2 c2 HII (II )a1 c2 . (1) (1)

(2)

Returning for the sake of completeness to the Haag-Bannier case we can write it as i¯ t (a1 , a2 , a , a ) h 1 2 = - h ¯2 a1 + a2 - a - a + V1 (a1 ) + V2 (a2 ) - V1 (a ) - V2 (a ) 1 2 1 2 2m dy1 (a1 - y1 )a1 [ dz (a1 , z, y1 , z) - 2i dz (a1 , z, a1 , z) dy2 (a2 - y2 )a2 [ dz (z, a2 , z, y2 ) - 2i dz (z, a2 , z, a2 ) dy1 (a - y1 )a [ dz (a , z, y1 , z) - 1 1 1 2i dz (a , z, a , z) 1 1 dz (z, y2 , z, a )] 2 (a1 , a2 , a , a ). 1 2 (23) dy2 (a - y2 )a [ dz (z, a , z, y2 ) - 2 2 2 2i dz (z, a , z, a ) 2 2 dz (y1 , z, a1 , z)] dz (z, y2 , z, a2 )] dz (y1 , z, a , z)] 1

+A1 (a1 ) +A2 (a2 ) -A1 (a ) 1 -A2 (a ) 2

Its pure state 2-particle counterpart is i¯ t (a1 , a2 ) = h - h ¯2 a1 + a2 + V1 (a1 ) + V2 (a2 ) 2m dz (a1 , z)a1 (a1 , z) - (a1 , z)a1 (a1 , z) 2i dz|(a1 , z)|2 dz (z, a2 )a2 (z, a2 ) - (z, a2 )a2 (z, a2 ) 2i dz|(z, a2 )|2 (a1 , a2 ). (24)

+A1 (a1 ) +A2 (a2 )

This equation has several interesting features. The Hamiltonian operator obviously reduces to the sum of ordinary 1-particle terms, involving no integrals, if  is a product state. What makes it unusual is the presence of the integrals. Typically it is said that such equations should not be taken into account because they are nonlocal . They indeed appear nonlocal but a closer look shows that it is in fact just the opposite: The currents and probability densities are the local 1-particle ones. Therefore it is the lack of appropriate inegrals that makes typical 2-particle equations nonlocal. The equation considered in [16] involved no such integrals and this led to difficulties. An extension of the above results from 2 to N particles is immediate so explicit formulas will not be given.
IV. FURTHER EXAMPLES

Let me now list some of nonlinear Hamiltonian operators that have been considered in literature and which admit the completely separable extension to an arbitrary number of particles in arbitrary entangled and mixed states. The general rule is that an extension to N particles will be given in one of these forms but instead of (x, x ) a reduced 1-particle density matrix should be placed. If the N -particle state is pure then the reduced density matrix is a functional of the pure state which involves N - 1 integrations. This matrix is subsequently put into a suitable place in the Schr¨dinger equation. Similarly it can be put into a Liouville-von Neumann equation if the state is more general. o a) "Nonlinear Schr¨dinger" o |(x)|2  (x, x) b) Bialynicki-Birula­Mycielski ln |(x)|2  ln (x, x) 5

The formalism proposed above allows to extend a 1-particle dynamics to N particles. We will now show that it allows for a more general kind of extension: From 1 system to N systems. The procedure is self-consistent in the sense that one can first produce several composite systems from the 1-particle ones, and then combine them into a single overall composite system. Alternatively, one can produce the final system without the intermediate stages, directly by extension from single particles. Consider the N -particle extension

VI. IS NONLINEAR QUANTUM MECHANICS NONLOCAL?

N. Gisin in his nowadays classic paper [8] argued that any nonlinear and non-stochastic dynamics necessarily leads to faster-than-light communication via EPR-type correlations. The argument is based (implicitly) on the additional assumption that a reduced density matrix (of, say, Alice) evolves by means of an independent dynamics of its purestate components. (Let us note that this was essentially the main question discussed by Haag and Bannier [3] in the context of the nonlinear, convex scheme proposed by Mielnik [32].) This viewpoint is suggested by the fact that what one starts with is a nonlinear (Schr¨dinger-type) dynamics of pure states. But in the EPR case the pure state is a o 2-particle one and one has to start with a 2-particle nonlinear Schr¨dinger equation. Assume this equation is given o (e.g. our Haag-Bannier equation) and its 2-particle pure-state solution | has been found. To have the Gisin effect one has to find at least one observable of the form ^ ^ ^ A = |A  1| = TrA A A (30)

describing the Alice subsystem, which depends on a parameter controlled by Bob. Here A = TrB | | is the reduced density matrix of the Alice subsystem. Assume that the only actions Bob can undertake are reducible to the modifications of the parameters of the Hamiltonian corresponding to "his" particle. (In the case contemplated by Gisin Bob would rotate his Stern-Gerlach device; this is equivalent to modifying the magnetic term in the corresponding ^ interaction Hamiltonian.) (30) shows that Bob can influence A if and only if the reduced density matrix A depends on the parameter he controls. This is true for the Weinberg theory [10] but will never happen for any equation we have discussed. It follows that the Gisin effect applies to a limited class of theories. The additional assumption that leads to the Gisin phenomenon is the following: Each time Bob makes a measurement, he chooses an initial condition for the reduced density matrix of Alice. This explicitly involves the ordinary reduction of the wave packet postulate. One can invent other versions of the postulate, for example, a composition of a nonlinear map N with a projector P : N -1  P  N , as proposed by L¨ cke in his analysis of nonlinear gauge u transformations [31]. Alternatively, as in the Weinberg theory, one can get the Gisin effect without the explicit use of the projection postulate: The nonlinear generator of evolution must be basis dependent. If this is the case, the 2-particle solution is parametrized by the choice of the basis in the Hilbert space. Assuming that Bob can change this basis we allow him to change globally the form of the solution. But the rotation of the Stern-Gerlach device (modification of the intarction term) is not yet a change of basis in this sense. In the Weinberg theory the generator was interpreted as 7

an average energy. A change of basis was equivalent to a different way of measuring the average. For this reason it was justified to say [12] that the effect was implied by the projection postulate although explicit calculations were not referring to any projections [10] (similarly to the linear case, the projection is not included in a non-stochastic Schr¨dinger dynamics). o We can conclude that the Gisin-type reasoning has to be regarded as "unphysical", exactly in the same sense as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument was unphysical according to Bohr. The version of nonlinear theory we have discussed seems to be free of physical inconsistencies and is not more nonlocal than the linear one. The idea of using the Haag-Bannier equation as a laboratory for testing the concepts of separbility was suggested to me by G. A. Goldin who also informed me about the results of his joint work with G. Svetlichny. I am indebted to G. A. Goldin, H.-D. Doebner, W. L¨ cke, P. Nattermann, and J. Hennig for valuable suggestions and critical u comments, and to W. Puszkarz who explained to me how to include into the framework the equations of Kostin [33] and Staruszkiewicz [34,35].

Abstract The previously proposed visualization of Rabi oscillations of a single atom by a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy is specified for the case of a single transition between levels caused by a -pulse of a driving field. An analysis in the framework of the restricted-pathintegral approach (which reduces effectively to a Schr¨dinger equation o with a complex Hamiltonian) shows that the measurement gives a reliable information about the system evolution, but the probability of the transition becomes less than unity. In addition an experimental setup is proposed for continuous monitoring the state of an atom by observation of electrons scattered by it. It is shown how this setup realizes a continuous fuzzy measurement of the atom energy.

Introduction

The problem of quantum measurements and related questions of decoherence, wave packet reduction etc. have always found great interest. In the last years continuous measurements were considered intensively [1]-[9]. In this connection the so-called quantum Zeno effect has been predicted and then confirmed experimentally [3]. This effect shows how a continuous measurement prevents transitions between discrete spectrum states. It thus demonstrates in the most evident way that a continuous measurement may strongly influence the measured system. In real measurements this influence on the measured system does not lead to absolute freezing its evolution but only strongly modifies it [4]. In the specific setup of a three-level system a random telegraph-type signal may be obtained from the measured system as a consequence of its "shelving" [5]. In all these cases the evolution of the discrete-level measured system is radically modified by the measurement as a result of strong back influence of the measuring device onto the measured system. The reason for this strong influence is that the considered continuous measurement was in fact a series of often short measurements which were so strong that they projected the measured system on one of its discrete eigenstates. In [6] such a procedure is called a "continuous projection measurement". In this context it is interesting and important to study a different class of quantum measurements and to ask the complementary question: Is it possible to continuously measure an individual quantum system with a not too strong influence on it so that the behavior of its state does not radically differ from what it would be if no measurement is performed. It is then to be expected that the obtained continuous measurement readout reflects the motion of the state thus making it visible. For this aim the measurement must be weak enough. Correspondingly it is unavoidable that it must have a not too high resolution, since the better the resolution of a measurement is, the stronger is its influence on the measured system. Because of this property such a weak measurement will also be called fuzzy. If now the measurement is presented as a series of short measurements, each of them must be fuzzy enough not to project on a single state. Finite-resolution continuous measurements in general as well as their influence on measured systems were in great detail investigated in [2] in the framework of the phenomenological restricted-path-integral (RPI) approach. 2

The continuous fuzzy measurement of an observable with discrete spectrum has been investigated in [7] in the context of the ensemble approach. It was shown that averaging over the ensemble of many readouts gives an information about the behavior of the state of the system (for example about Rabi oscillations). However this procedure is not applicable to an individual system like a single atom which is continuously measured. The RPI approach on the other hand is. It was first applied to a discretespectrum observable (energy of a two-level system) in [8]. It was shown that the quantum Zeno effect arises if the resolution of the measurement is good enough (in comparison with the level difference). However the analysis given in [8] was not complete because only the special case of constant measurement readouts coinciding with energy levels (E(t)  const = En ) was considered. The detailed analysis given in [9] showed that in the case of the measurement with an intermediate resolution (not too low to give no information and not too high to lead to the Zeno effect) transitions between levels (Rabi oscillations) maintain though are modified, and the measurement readout E(t) is correlated with these oscillations. Thus, transitions between levels may be continuously monitored with the help of a fuzzy continuous measurement. Of course, the error of this monitoring is comparatively large and principally cannot be made small. In the present paper we shall continue exploring this possibility in a simple case of a so-called -pulse of the driving field bringing the system, in absence of any measurement, from one level to another. We shall discuss a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy in such a system. It will be shown that the measurement readout visualizes the quantum transition but on the price that the transition becomes less probable. We shall first shortly discuss the problem in the framework of the RPI approach to show what results of the measurement may be expected in this case. Then a possible experimental realization of the measurement of this type, namely, monitoring the energy of an atom by scattering electrons on it, will be described.

Predictions made by the RPI method

We consider a multilevel system with Hamiltonian H0 and corresponding energy levels En . It is influenced by an external driving field with potential V = V (t) leading to transitions if no measurement is applied. Then the 3

continuous measurement of the energy H0 of this system may be described according to [9] by the effective Schr¨dinger equation o  i |t = - H -  H0 - E(t) t h ¯
2

|t

(1)

with H = H0 + V . For a given measurement readout [E] = {E(t)|T1  t  T2 } the probability density for the realization of this readout is given by P [E] = T2 |T2 where |T2 is the solution |t of Eq. (1) taken at the end of the observation interval [T1 , T2 ]. Note that because of the damping term the norm of |T2 decreases with time. The inverse of the parameter  > 0 may serve as a measure of fuzziness. No measurement corresponds to  = 0. Normalization of |T2 leads to the state vector at t = T2 . Expanding |t according to |t = Cn (t)|n (t) in the orthonormal h basis |n (t) = e-iEn t/¯ |n of time-dependent eigenstates of H0 , we obtain P [E] = n |Cn (T2 )|2 . For the case of a 2-level system and a resonant driving field with frequency  (E = E2 - E1 = h) Eq. (1) reduces to ¯  C1 = -iv(t)C2 - (E1 - E(t))2 C1 ,  C2 = -iv(t)C1 - (E2 - E(t))2 C2 (2)

with 1 |V 2 = 2 |V 1  = hv(t). ¯ For  = 0 and v(t) = v0 = const the system undergoes Rabi oscillations between the eigenstates with the period TR = /v0 . We consider a -pulse in the interval [0, T ] where T1  0  T  T2 , so that T = TR /2 and v(t) = v0 in the interval [0, T ], v(t) = 0 outside this interval. If the system is on level 1 at the initial time moment (C1 (T1 ) = 1, C2 (T1 ) = 0) and no measurement is performed ( = 0 so that the wave function is normalized at all times), then the system is subject to the level transition during the interval [0, T ]. This means that the probability |C2 (t)|2 to be at level 2 gradually increases during this interval and achieves unity at the end of it. A quantity by which the fuzziness of the measurement can be described quantitatively and which may replace  in physical discussions is the level resolution time Tlr = 1/E 2 (comp. [9]). If a continuous fuzzy measurement lasts longer than Tlr , it distinguishes (resolves) between the levels. Small Tlr represents quick level resolution because of small fuzziness and therefore strong Zeno-type influence of the measurement. The larger Tlr is, the weaker is the influence of measurement on the atom. 4

It was shown in [9] that with TR and 4Tlr being of the same order there is a regime where correlations between oscillations of the state vector and the energy readout [E] are to be expected. This regime lies between the Zeno and Rabi regimes. In extending [9] we present now some results of a numerical analysis of Eq. (2) for this regime of measurement. Details will be published elsewhere. Random curves E(t) were generated, for each of them Eq. (2) was solved, the norm of the solution at the final time |C1(T2 )|2 + |C2 (T2 )|2 was found and interpreted as the probability density P [E] that the curve E(t) occur as the measurement readout. The corresponding normalized coefficients cn = Cn / |C1 |2 + |C2 |2 present the behavior of the system for the case that the measurement gives the readout E(t). For the further analysis all curves E(t) were smoothed with the time scale of the order of T to eliminate insignificant fast oscillations but conserve the information about the transition. Then they were separated into 4 classes E11 , E12 , E21 , E22 according to the location of initial E(T1 ) and final E(T2 ) points of the curve. For example, if the curve begins below the middle line E = (E1 + E2 )/2 and ends higher than this, it is included in the classE12 and interpreted as the readout describing a transition from the level 1 onto level 2. Probabilities of these classes were found by summation of probability densities P [E] by the Monte Carlo method. In the case of a -pulse one could naively expect that only curves of the class E12 may arise as measurement readouts (as is the case without the measurement). The calculation gives different results. For the regime of measurement intermediate between Zeno and Rabi the results are following. The curves of the classes E21 and E22 arise with small probabilities. However the probabilities of the classes E11 , E12 are comparable. Therefore, influence of the measurement sometimes may prevent the transition. Fig. 1 gives an idea of what the result of the measurement will be and how it will reflect the behavior of the system in an intermediate measurement regime (4Tlr /TR = 5/3). Upper diagrams present possible readouts E(t) and the corresponding curves P2 (t) = |c2 (t)|2 characterizing the behavior of the system state are given below. The left pair of diagrams shows all possible readouts E(t), while the middle and right pairs show the readouts of the classes E12 and E11 correspondingly. The curves are presented by density plots taking into account probability densities P [E] (being the same for the 5

Figure 1: Density plots of measurement readouts E(t) and corresponding curves |c2 (t)|2 giving the probability to be at level 2. In the left pair of diagrams all measurement readouts are drawn while the middle and right ones represent the readouts of the classes E12 (transition from level 1 to level 2) and E11 (staying at level 1) correspondingly. curve E(t) and the corresponding P2 (t)). It is seen from Fig. 1 that the information given by the measurement readout E(t) is reliable. This means that a readout E(t) and the corresponding curve P2 (t) characterizing the behavior of the measured system with high probability correspond to each other. For example, if E(t) belongs to the class E12 , then the behavior of P2 (t) is characteristic for the transition from level 1 to level 2. If E(t) belongs to the class E11 , then P2 (t) also in most cases describes the system which finally stays at level 1 or close to it. Thus, the qualitative conclusion from the numerical analysis is the following: the visualization of an externally driven quantum transition by a continuous measurement of energy of the appropriate fuzziness is possible. But as price for this information the transition itself becomes uncertain: it may occur or not occur with probabilities of the same order. The probability of the transition increases with the measurement becoming more fuzzy (larger 4Tlr ). However, the information becomes then less reliable, the noise increases. When the measurement becomes too fuzzy (4Tlr  TR ), the Rabi regime arises: the measurement does not influence the system but it also gives no information. 6

Vice versa, the transition becomes less probable for a more strong measurement (smaller 4Tlr ). By too strong measurement (4Tlr  TR ) the transition is prevented completely and the Zeno regime of the measurement arises. Let us now turn to a real experimental setup where these theoretical predictions can be observed.

The experimental setup

The basic idea for the realization of a fuzzy measurement of energy proposed below is the following: A single 2-level atom with energy levels E1 and E2 changes its state c1 (t) = (3) c2 (t) (normalized so that |c1 (t)|2 + |c2 (t)|2 = 1) under the influence of a resonant laser field. We want to monitor some characteristic of the state of the atom that may be interpreted as monitoring of its mean energy given by E(t) = E1 |c1 (t)|2 + E2 |c2 (t)|2

We assume that the polarizabilities 1 and 2 of the atom on the two levels are different. The atom is placed in an electric field E0 which induces a dipole moment. Since the polarization of the atom in the process of its transition between the energy eigenstates changes, the dipole moment changes correspondingly. If we now scatter a sequence of single electrons by this atom, the corresponding cross section will depend on (2 - 1 )E0 (|c2 (t)|2 - |c1 (t)|2 ) and can be determined as a function of time. This results according to (4) in an energy readout E(t). As we will show below, there are means of controlling the weakness of the back influence of the electrons on the atom, so that fuzzy measurements are possible. In the experimental setup which we propose (see Fig. 2) an atom Z is
In the framework of the two-level approximation, the polarizabilities may be introduced only phenomenologically. A correct definition of them would require to include the other levels of the atom.

A constant electric field E0 directed along the xaxis is applied to induce a dipole moment. This field is created by a molecule with a fixed dipole moment d1 (also directed along x) located near the atom Z. The resonant radiation of frequency  is focused on the atom. It causes a dipole moment consisting of two contributions: a comparatively slowly varying one to which we referred above and quickly oscillating one. The latter is proportional to |c (t)c2 (t)|d where d is the dipole moment of the 1 transition between the first and second levels of the atom. The characteristic frequency of oscillations is high (  1015 sec-1 ) and therefore its contribution to the scattering cross section of the electrons is negligible. Substrate and the atom are covered by a thin layer of liquid helium. The possibility to use liquid helium for the exploration of single microobjects has been considered earlier in [11]. Free electrons swim on the surface of liquid helium [12, 13] being pressed to this surface by a constant electric field produced by a plate above the helium. Electrons are scattered by the electric field of the dipole moment of the atom. Moving along the surface of the liquid helium after scattering, the electrons come to the region under microchannel plates capable to register single electrons (the potential between the plates and the substrate creates an electric field turning the electron off the surface and accelerating them toward the plates). Different problems regarding the realization of the experiment will be addressed below.

Analysis of the experiment

The electrons swimming on the surface of the liquid helium are scattered by a potential Vdip (r) which is caused by the fixed external dipole moment d1 and the induced atomic dipole moment: Vdip (r) = (L2 eL d1 + + r2 )3/2 1 0 0 2 E0 (5)

Fig. 2a), r is the two-dimensional vector describing the position of the electron on the surface and e is the electron charge. The atom and the electron passing by are treated as a composed system which is described in the corresponding product space. In a scattering process the state of the electron as well as the state of the atom is changed. Let us address the electron first. In the Born approximation [14] in two dimensions the differential cross section for the electron scattering (which has the dimension of length) turns out to be  d = (t) exp - sin d 2 (6)

where (t) = 2m3/2 e2 d2 (t)/¯ 3 (2Ee )1/2 ,  = 4L(2Ee m)1/2 /¯ (m is the elech h tron mass, Ee its energy and h Planck constant). The time dependent state ¯ of the atom enters Eq. (6) via d2 (t) = d2 + d2 + 2d0 d(|c2 (t)|2 - |c1 (t)|2 ) 0 where 1 1 d0 = d1 + (2 + 1 )E0 , d = (2 - 1 )E0 2 2 The total cross section corresponding to Eq. (6) is (t) = 2(t)[I0 () - L0 ()] (7) (8)

(9)

where I0 () is the Bessel function with an imaginary argument and L0 () the modified Struwe function [15]. However a simpler expression may be taken to obtain estimates: (t) =  4(t) 1 - exp -  2 9 (10)

We have   10-7 m for d(t)  10-29 Coulomb m, Ee  10-4eV. To have no additional complications let us restrict to the case where  is sufficiently small (  1) so that d/d does not depend on . To avoid the dispersion of d/d due to the dispersion of energies of the incoming electrons, the electrons with energies strongly different from some fixed energy  Ee should not participate in the scattering. This may be provided by different technical ways which we will not discuss in the present paper. We shall only introduce a coefficient s indicating the number of times the primary flux of electrons is attenuated after such separation. The total time dependent cross section for the electron scattering has then the form (t) = 0 + (t) where only the second term depends on the momentary state of the atom: 4 2 m3/2 e2 2 (d0 + d2 ), 0 = 3  )1/2 h (2Ee ¯ with  = 0 (t) = (|c2 (t)|2 - |c1 (t)|2 ) (11)

We add some remarks concerning the experimental realization. The applicability of the Born approximation requires validness of the following condition [14]: ed(t) h2 ¯ 2mEe L (13)  2 2 L mL h2 ¯ Both parts of Eq. (13) turn out to be of the same order for realistic parameters (L  10-8m, Ee  10-4 eV, d(t)  10-29 Coulomb m). Eq. (6) may nevertheless be used at least for rough estimates. Let us estimate the flux F (t) of the scattered electrons which previously passed through the collimator consisting of two slits of the width q with the distance l between them:
 q 2Ee F (t)  s (t)ne l m 1/2

= g(t)

(14)

Here g is the flux of the incoming electrons. It is expressed in the following parameters: s is a factor accounting for attenuation of the flux after selection of their energy (see above), ne is the number of electrons per a unit of area 10

of the surface of the liquid helium. To be able to distinguish the scattered electrons from those not scattered, it is necessary that the ratio q/l satisfies the condition q/l   -1 . For the parameters indicated above, we can take  q/l  0.1. The estimate for s is s  Ee /Ee where Ee is the dispersion  of energies of incoming electrons. Taking Ee  0.1Ee we have s  0.1. 13 -2 Then, for ne  10 m (an instability arises for larger ne because electrons  "drown" in the liquid helium [13]), Ee  10-4 eV and s  q/l  0.1 we have F (t)  (106 ÷ 107 )sec-1 . If we investigate some transition of the atom between its two energy eigenstates, it is evident that sufficiently large number of scatterings has to occur during the time T of the transition. In other words, the inequality F (t)T  1 must be fulfilled. On the other hand, T must be less than the time of spontaneous radiance of the atom Z. Based on the above estimate of F (t), the time of spontaneous radiance must be significantly larger than (10-6 ÷ 10-7 )sec. This imposes restrictions on the choice of possible candidates for the atom Z. We assume that the ingoing electrons are coming one by one and are either deflected or not deflected by the atom. Before such an event happens at the time t the atom is in the state (t) of Eq. (3). After the event the total system is in an entangled state for which the deflected electron state and the non-deflected electron state are combined with the respective atom states after the electron has passed by. The electrons are then registered as being deflected or not by the corresponding plates D and D  (see Fig. 2b). This reduces the state of the total system and the state of the atom is changed this way. If a deflection of the electron happens, the influence of the interaction potential V (r) of Eq. (5) results in the modified normalized atom state   (t) with a1 (t) 0 c1 c1 = (15) 0 a2 (t) c2 c2 whereby a1 (t) = d0 - d , d(t) a2 (t) = d0 + d d(t) (16)

If on the other hand the deflection did not happen (i.e. the electron was registered by the microchannel plate D  ), the expression for a1 (t), a2 (t) has another form: a1 (t) = 1- (t)(d0 - d)2 2qd2 (t) 11 1- (t) q

a2 (t) =

(17)

To sum up: The observation of the scattered electrons at the time t supplies some information about (t) (see Sect. 5 for details). By this an information about the state (t) of the atom (namely about |c2 (t)|2 -|c1 (t)|2 ) is obtained by which the energy E(t) of the atom may be worked out according to E E E(t) = E + (t) = E + ((t) - 0 ) (18) 2 2 where E = (E1 + E2 )/2 and E = E2 - E1 . This formula enables us to compare the theoretically calculated behavior of the function E(t) with the function (t) determined from the experimental scattering results. Simultaneously the state of the atom is changed. It is important to note that according to Eqs. (15) and (16) this must not result in a projection onto one of the energy eigenstates. Rather the atomic state may be only weakly influenced in one scattering event if |d|  d0 . This represents a condition for the measurement of E(t) to be fuzzy. We return to this below. Let us first proceed to the question how to measure (t).

5

Degree of fuzziness

We have to address the problem how to estimate (t) from the number of scatterings. We make this estimate on a series consisting of N events when a single electron passes the atom. Let N1 (t) be the corresponding number of events in the series resulting in the deflection. Before scattering, the electrons have to pass the slit of the collimator with the opening q (see Fig. 2b). The ratio (t)/q is equal to the probability p that a single electron will be scattered by the atom. This probability may be estimated from the data on N electrons by the ratio N1 /N where N1 is the number of those electrons which were deflected. We then have approximately N1 (t) (t)  q N or with (18) E(t) - E q  E 2 12 N1 0 - N q (20) (19)

This completes the measurement of E(t) of Eq. (4). In measuring (t) in fact |c2 |2 will be measured in the experiment. This corresponds indeed to the intended visualization of the quantum transition. But with the setup described above one is indeed capable of more, namely of testing experimentally evidence for the theoretical predictions for the continuous fuzzy measurement of energy as they are illustrated by Fig. 1. The reason for this is that a detailed analysis of the setup (which will be presented elsewhere) shows that this setup represents a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy in the sense of Sect. 2 provided that the difference of the dipole moments attributed to the two energy eigenstates is small enough, |d|  d0 The level resolution time (a measure of fuzziness) turns out to be then Tlr = 1 4g0 d0 d

(22)

As discussed already in connection with Eqs. (15) and (16), the second factor in Eq. (22) represents the weakness of the influence on the atom caused by the deflection of one single electron. In fact we are concerned with a succession of many scattering events. If they happen very quickly, g0 is large. Correspondingly the influence of the measurement will be strong and Tlr small. This explains the first factor in Eq. (22).

Conclusion

The previously predicted possibility to visualize the time dependence of a quantum transition of a single atom with the help of a fuzzy continuous measurement of energy is demonstrated in detail for the case of a -pulse of a driving field. The realization of the corresponding measurement is discussed. The RPI analysis shows that the visualization is possible but at the price of additional quantum uncertainties. Namely, even in the case of a -pulse, when in the absence of the measurement the transition occurs with certainty, it may with comparable probabilities occur or not in the presence of the continuous fuzzy measurement. In both cases the information given by the energy readout is reliable i.e. it corresponds with high probability to the evolution of the system state. 13

As a scheme of realization, scattering electrons by a fixed two-level atom is considered. The electrons probe the state of the atom. The fuzziness (weakness) of the measurement is represented by the fact that each scattering event changes the internal state of the atom only insignificantly. This is radically different from the often considered scheme of repeated measurements in which the atom is projected on one of the levels after each measurement.

Abstract
Quantum Turing machines are discussed and reviewed in this paper. Most of the paper is concerned with processes defined by a step operator T that is used to construct a Hamiltonian H according to Feynman's prescription. Differences between these models and the models of Deutsch are discussed and reviewed. It is emphasized that the models with H constructed from T include fully quantum mechanical processes that take computation basis states into linear superpositions of these states. The requirement that T be distinct path generating is reviewed. The advantage of this requirement is that Schr¨dinger evolution under H is one o dimensional along distinct finite or infinite paths of nonoverlapping states in some basis BT . It is emphasized that BT can be arbitrarily complex with extreme entanglements between states of component systems. The new aspect of quantum Turing machines introduced here is the emphasis on the structure of graphs obtained when the states in the BT paths are expanded as linear superpositions of states in a reference basis such as the computation basis BC . Examples are discussed that illustrate the main points of the paper. For one example the graph structures of the paths in BT expanded as states in BC include finite stage binary trees and concatenated finite stage binary trees with or without terminal infinite binary trees. Other examples are discussed in which the graph structures correspond to interferometers and iterations of interferometers. 03.65.Bz,89.70.+c

I. INTRODUCTION

Quantum computation is a field with much activity in recent years. Most work on models of quantum computers has been concerned with networks of quantum gates [1­3]. Models based on quantum Turing machines [4­8] have also been described. Networks of quantum gates are appealing because they are similar to integrated circuits in that they are built up from simple elementary quantum gates. Also working physical models of quantum computers are likely to have this network structure. Networks of quantum gates are characterized by the fact that the complexity of the computation appears explicitly in the complexity of the layout and interconnections of the quantum gates and qubit lines making up the network. Because of this networks of more than a few gates are hard to conceptualize as physical models. For complex networks heirarchical descriptions in terms of simpler component networks are useful. Examples are the networks for the discrete Fourier transform [2] and Shor's Algorithm [9,10]. Quantum Turing machines (QTMs) are quite different in that the complexity of the computation is not reflected in the physical model. Instead the complexity is reflected in the dynamical description of the model either as a unitary operator describing the possible finite time interval steps or in the description of the Hamiltonian for the model. The physical model, consisting of a finite state head interacting with one (or if needed for convenience more than one) qubit lattice, remains fixed for the different models. In this paper the discussion will be limited to quantum Turing machines. An interesting aspect of these systems is that they can be expanded in different directions to illustrate different properties. For example the description of the Hamiltonian can be easily expanded to include the presence of finite potential barriers on computation paths where the potential distribution is computable. These result in reflections of the computation back along the computation paths [11]. An example of this has been discussed in detail elsewhere [12,13]. Also the physical model of QTMs is a natural basis for expansion into a model of quantum robots interacting with an environment [14]. In this paper step operators T for each QTM are first defined by conditions on matrix elements in the computation basis. This follows the definition of Deutsch [5]. These operators can either be used to represent model steps occurring in a finite time interval, as was done by Deutsch, or they can be used to directly construct a Hamiltonian according to Feynman's prescription [15]. This was the method used by Benioff. Differences between these two types of models are discussed in Section III. Another definition of T as a finite sum of elementary step operators is given in Section IV. This definition, much used by the author in earlier work [6,8], has the advantage that description of a step operator with a specified set of elementary steps is easier under this definition than with the matrix element definition. It is seen that, for the particular form of the unitary operators appearing in the elementary step sum, the matrix element definition is more general in that final state correlations between changes in the head state, head position, and scanned qubit state are included. Both definitions include initial state correlations and include steps that take computation basis states into linear superpositions of these states. In most of this paper QTM step operators T will be used to construct model Hamiltonians according to Feynman's prescription [15]. In this case the requirement that T be distinct path generating much simplifies the dynamics of the system. The main consequence of this 2

requirement, which is reviewed and discussed in Section V, is that Schr¨dinger evolution of o the computation corresponds to one dimensional motion along paths of states in some basis BT . The paths are defined by iterations of T and T  on states in BT . The dependence on T is indicated by the subscript. Basis dependent (matrix) and basis independent (operator) descriptions of this property are reviewed. The form of the eigenfunctions and spectrum for Hamiltonians constructed from T s that are distinct path generating is also summarized. A sum over paths representation of e-iHt for H constructed from step operators that are distinct path generating is described. Section V concludes with a review of the fact that there is no effective way to determine in general if a step operator is distinct path generating. Fully quantum mechanical computations are included because BT can be arbitrarily complex with extreme entanglements between the component system states. Examples will be given to show this and to show that T takes computation basis states into linear superpositions of computation basis states. Thus distinct path generation is not limited to descriptions of a "classical Turing machine made of quantum components" [2]. Demonstration of this point, which was also made in [8], is one of the goals of this paper. The main novel feature introduced in this paper is an emphasis on the graph structure aspects of the paths in BT when the states in BT are expanded into superpositions of states in a fixed basis. Stated differently the main interest here is not in the outcome of a process such as a quantum computation. Instead the interest is in the graph properties of the computation paths relative to a fixed basis, such as the computation basis. Because of this aspect there is some overlap between this work and other work in the literature [16­18] describing motion of systems in graphs of interconnected quantum wires. These properties are illustrated in Section VI by discussion of examples chosen to illustrate various points. All the examples are fully quantum mechanical in that they take computation basis states into linear superpositions of these states. The first example, the erasure? operator, is given to show that there are step operators, which at first glance appear to describe irreversible processes, in fact describe reversible processes. The second example, product qubit transformations followed by add 1, describes generation of a linear superpositions of states corresponding to all numbers up to 2n-1 and adding 1 to each. Depending on the initial states graph structures corresponding to one or more iterated binary trees with finite numbers of stages are generated. Also a terminal infinite binary tree may or may not be appended. The third group of examples is introduced to show that closed graphs with loops are included. In particular the graph structure of the examples corresponds to that of interferometers in coordinate space. The examples show that depending on the initial state, iterated loops corresponding to successive opening and closing of interferometer type structures are included. It is seen that activities in each arm can be different although they must be such that differences in states in each arm must be removed coherently when the arms are closed.
II. THE PHYSICAL MODEL

The physical model used here corresponds to one-tape quantum Turing machines. Extension to machines with more than one tape, as in Bennett's description of reversible machines [19] is straightforward. The model consists of a two-way infinite one dimensional lattice of systems each of which can assume states in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. if the space 3

is two dimensional, the systems are referred to as qubits. This term will be used here even if the dimensionality is greater than two. It is often convenient but not necessary to consider the lattice as spin systems, e.g. spin 1/2 systems for binary qubits. A head which can assume any one of a finite number of orthogonal states |l with l = 1, 2, · · · , L moves along the lattice interacting with qubits at or next to its location on the lattice. Elementary QTM actions include one or more of (1) head motion one lattice site to the right or left, (2) change of the state of the qubit scanned or read by the head, (3) change of the head state. What happens depends on the states of the head and scanned qubit. Here the system states are all assumed to lie in a separable Hilbert space H. Based on the above description a particular basis, the computation basis, defined by the set of states {|l, j, s } and which spans H, is used. Here l, j refer to the internal state and lattice position of the head. The qubit lattice computation basis state |s =  m=- |sm where sm = 0 or 1 is the state of the qubit at lattice site m. From now on the computation basis will be denoted by BC . In order to keep H separable (a denumerable basis), it is necessary to impose some condition on |s . Here it will be required that sm = 0 for at most a finite number of values of m. This condition, the 0 tail state condition, is one of many that can be imposed to keep the basis denumerable. Models of QTMs without tail conditions would have to be described by quantum field theory on a lattice to take account of the presence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom.
III. THE STEP OPERATOR

Models of QTMs in the literature [5,6,8,12] can be described by step operators T that correspond to single steps of a computation. In terms of matrix elements between states in BC , T must satisfy a locality condition given by superpositions of states in BC : ~ l , j  , s |T |l, j, s = s =j |s=j l , j  , s j  |T |l, j, sj (1)

Here |s = |s=j |sj where |sj is the state of the site j qubit. This condition states that single step changes in the state of the lattice qubits are limited to the qubit at the position of the head. ~ The operator T describes the interactions of the head with qubits on the lattice. Since ~ the interaction is localized to the qubit at the head position, T can be described as an operator on the Hilbert space spanned by states of the form |l, j, s . This corresponds to the head in state |l at position j and the site j qubit in state |s .1 Another condition on T is that head motion on the lattice is limited to at most one site in either direction. Also all lattice sites are equivalent (space is homogenous). These conditions are given respectively by

general the states have the form |l, j, s, k that describe the head at site j and the qubit at ~ site k. However since T (and T ) have nonzero matrix elements only for states of the form |l, j, s, j where k = j, the two j positions are combined.

for all j, j  and all  = -1, 0, 1. Pj is the projection operator for the head at site j. This definition differs in some inessential details from that given by Deutsch [5] for QTMs. One difference is that the possibility that  = 0 is included. This addition is not essential in that it has been shown [7] that for every QTM that includes steps with no change in the head position there is an equivalent (slower) QTM which excludes these steps (i.e.  = -1, 1 only). Also systems with  = 0 excluded are simpler to analyze. In the QTM models of Deutsch, T describes the transformation associated with a finite time interval t. Thus T is also required to be unitary. Iterations of T give the successive transformations at times that are integer multiples of t. The implicit existence of Hamiltonians that generate these transformations was assumed. Models of QTMs described by Benioff [6,8,12] differ from those of Deutsch in that T is used directly to construct a Hamiltonian according to Feynman's prescription: [15] H = K(2 - T - T  ) (3)

where K is a constant. This definition has the property that if T = Y where Y describes free head motion with no interaction along the lattice (Y |l, j, s = |l, j + 1, s ), then H is the kinetic energy of free head motion on the lattice. As such it is equivalent to the symmetrized discrete version of the second derivative, -(¯ 2 /2m)d2 /dx2 . As defined H is local as the head h interacts only with qubits at or next to its location. Also the requirement that T be unitary is dropped. As noted above the main difference between the two types of models is that in those of Deutsch T is unitary and it describes changes occurring in a finite time interval. In the models of Benioff T is used to directly construct a Hamiltonian H with the changes in a finite time interval t given by e-iHt . In this case T need not be unitary. One consequence of these differences is that in the models of Benioff e-iHt is not local even though H is local. In the models of Deutsch [5] T represents the model evolution in a finite time interval and is supposed to be local. This requirement is not realistic in the sense that there is no local Hamiltonian H that satisfies T = e-iHt for finite t. This is easily seen by examination of the terms in a power series expansion of e-iHt where H has a finite but nonzero spatial range. Of course from a practical standpoint, even though e-iHt is not exactly local, it is approximately local in that matrix elements between sufficiently separated space positions are extremely small. Otherwise it would not be possible to isolate systems for carrying out experiments.
IV. T AS A SUM OF ELEMENTARY STEP OPERATORS

The conditions given on T by Eqs. 1 and 2 for T used in the Hamiltonian of Eq. 3 were done in a way to emphasize the similarities between the two types of QTM models. However it is often quite useful to define T as a finite sum 5

T =

(4)

over elementary step operators Tl,s . This method has been used by the author to model QTMs [4,6,8,12] as this description makes it relatively clear what elementary steps are needed to accomplish a specific computation. It also is easier to see how the different elementary step operators interconnect in a QTM. The elementary step operator Tl,s describes the single step that occurs in case the head is in state |l and the qubit at the head location is in state |s . Tl,s is defined by,


Tl,s = l,s
j=-

wl,s Ql vl,s Ps,j ul,sPj

(5)

where Ql , Pj , Ps,j are respective projection operators for the head in internal state |l , at site j, and the site j qubit in state |s . l,s is a numerical constant. The operators wl,s , vl,s , ul,s act in the finite dimensional Hilbert space of head states, the two dimensional qubit Hilbert space, and in the space of head lattice position states respectively where they describe head and qubit state changes, and head motion. The operators wl,s , vl,s , ul,s are unitary in their respective spaces, and ul,s satisfies the condition that j  |ul,s |j = 0 only if |j  - j| = 0, 1. The possibility that these operators can be different for different values of l, s is indicated by the subscripts. The form of the equation for Tl,s shows projection operators on computation basis states followed by unitary operators. Depending on the process to be modelled it is sometimes useful to invert the order of the projection and unitary operators for one or more of the system components. An example would be to replace wl,s Ql by Ql wl,s in Eq. 5. This is the case if some component computation basis state is the desired final state. This will be seen in the first and third examples studied. In most work using this form of T, l,s = 1 for all l, s in the sum. The case 0  l,s  1 was considered elsewhere [12]. A detailed analysis of a simple case was done for which l,s < 1 corresponded to the introduction of potential barriers in the computation paths [13,20]. For this example the distribution and widths of the potential barriers in the paths was quasiperiodic [21] and corresponded to a generalized substitution sequence [22­24]. This definition includes Tl,s that take computation basis states into linear superpositions of the basis states. In particular T |l, j, s = |s=j s,sj Tl,s |l, j, s where Tl,s |l, j, s = l,s

Here wl,s and vl,s can be any L dimensional and 2 dimensional unitary operators respectively and ul,s can be such that the matrix elements j + |ul,s|j are non zero for all three values of . The definition of T as a step operator that satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2 is somewhat more general than T defined as an l, s sum by Eq. 4 with Tl,s defined by Eq. 5. To see this one notes that any T defined by Eqs. 4 and 5 satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2. To examine the converse let T be a step operator that satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2. From these ~ equations it follows that the corresponding operator T and, as a result T , can always be expressed as an l, s sum in the form 6

T =
l,s

T Pl,s

(7)

where


Pl,s =
j=-

Ql Ps,j Pj

(8)

where the projection operators are as defined in Eq. 5. From this one sees that T Pl,s = Tl,s if and only if T Pl,s = l,s wl,s  vl,s  ul,s Pl,s . (9)

This shows that the definition of Tl,s given by Eq. 5 is restricted to uncorrelated unitary transformations of the head state and position and qubit state. That is the action of T defined by Eqs. 4 and 5 converts a computation basis state |l, j, s into wl,s |l ul,s|j |s=j vl,s |sj where s = sj . Correlation with the initial state is included through the l, s dependence of the different unitary operators in Eq. 5.
V. DISTINCT PATH GENERATION

Here the property of distinct path generation for step operators will be reviewed and discussed. This property is quite useful because the dynamics of any such process with a Hamiltonian given by Eq. 3 corresponds to one dimensional motion along distinct paths of states in some basis B. In this case the complexity of the process is contained in the complexity of the states in B and their ordering in paths. In particular the states in B can describe arbitrary entanglements among states of component systems in the model. In general a path of states is an ordered set of states in a Hilbert space H. Here the interest is in paths generated by operators T on H that represent the single steps of a process. If 1 is a state in H, then the set of states {T n 1 , (T  )-m 1 } for integral m, n where n  0, m < 0 represents a path of states. The ordering of the states in a path is conveniently expressed by the notation |k, i  T k 1 for integral k  0 and |k, i  (T  )-k 1 for k < 0. The relation  means equality up to normalization. The path label is denoted by i where |0, i = 1 and k denotes the path position of the state. The state T n 1 for n  0 is a terminal state if T n+1 1 = 0. Similarly (T  )-m 1 for m < 0 is terminal if (T  )-m+1 1 = 0. Paths are two way infinite or cyclic if they have no terminal states, one way infinite if they have one terminal state, and finite with distinct ends if they have two terminal states. The goal of the above definitions of paths is to satisfy the condition that iterations of T or T  on states describe successive steps of a quantum computation in the forward or backward direction respectively. So far this requirement is not satisfied because any state |k, i in a path may have nonzero overlap with other states |j, i in the path. Thus state |k, i which is supposed to correspond to completion of the kth step may also correspond to completion of the jth and other steps. To remove this possibility it is required that all the states in any path must be pairwise orthogonal. If this condition is satisfied then the state |k, i represents unambiguously the 7

completion of the kth step in the forward direction for k  0 and in the backward direction for k < 0. Another condition that must be satisfied is that for each n  0 and m < 0, T  T n+1 1 = T n 1 and T (T  )-m 1 = (T  )-m-1 1 . This condition expresses the requirement that motion one step backwards from the state corresponding to completion of the n + 1st step should give the state corresponding to completion of the nth step. Also motion one step forward from the -mth step in the backward direction should give the state corresponding to the -m - 1st backward step (recall that m < 0). A third condition is that if 2 is a state that is orthogonal to all states in the path defined above for 1 , denoted from now on as path 1, then all states in path 2, generated as defined above with 2 replacing 1 , should be orthogonal to all states in path 1. By convention 2 is in no path if T 2 = T  2 = 0. This expresses the intuitive requirement that computations started out on initial states that are orthogonal must maintain the orthogonality through all steps, forward and backward, of the computation. Otherwise one could not associate an outcome with a specific input. Mathematically these conditions are expressed by requiring that T be distinct path generating. That is there must exist some basis B such that for each |b in B if T |b = 0 then, up to normalization, T |b is a state in B. Similarly if T  |b = 0, then, up to normalization, T  |b is in B. It follows from this condition that all states in a path are pairwise orthogonal or both T and T  are the identity on some |b . Up to normalization means that the normalized state T |b /| b|T T |b |1/2 is in B. A similar condition holds for T  . The above condition of pairwise orthogonality of states within a path combined with the condition of orthogonality of all states in one path with those in another path can be expressed by j, i|k, i = 0 unless j = k and i = i . Here |k, i and|j, i are states in B. The condition that states generated by iteration of T and T  remain within a path is expressed by T |k, i = 0  T |k, i  |k + 1, i and T  |k, i = 0  T  |k, i  |k - 1, i . These conditions for distinct path generation can be combined into one condition. This is that T must be such that there exists a basis B for which each row and each column of the matrix of T in B contains at most one nonzero element. If this condition is satisfied, it is always possible to choose B so that the matrix elements of T are positive real numbers. In addition the matrix elements are bounded from above, since T is bounded, and from below, for technical reasons (noted in the next section). It is convenient to let BT denote any basis for which T (and T  ) is distinct path generating. In general if T is distinct path generating, there are a great many bases for which T is distinct path generating. This may be the case if there is more than one copy of paths of the same type (two way infinite, finite of the same length, etc.,) present. For the models of quantum computers considered here there are either no copies or infinitely many copies of the same type present. This is a consequence of the spatial homogeneity of T .
A. Basis Independent Description of Distinct Path Generation

The above description of distinct path generation is basis dependent as it is given in terms of matrix elements of T in some basis. An equivalent basis independent operator theoretic description is also possible. It has been shown elsewhere [8,12] that the conditions given above for distinct path generation are equivalent to the requirement that T is a direct sum of weighted shifts [25]. That is 8

T = UD = i Ui Di

(10)

where for each i Ui is either a bilateral shift, a unilateral shift, the complement of a unilateral shift, a finite shift or a cyclic shift. Many copies of each type can be present and some types may be absent. The types of paths associated with each of these shift types are shown in Figure 1. Note that the only shifts that are unitary are the bilateral and cyclic shifts. This follows from the decomposition theorem for power partial isometries [26] since U is a power partial isometry and D is a diagonal operator [25]. The i sum corresponds to a sum over distinct path subspaces Hi where Hi is spanned by the basis states in the path generated by Ui and its adjoint. That is if |j, i is such a state in Hi then either |j, i is terminal for U or U|j, i = Ui |j, i = |j + 1, i . A similar condition holds for U  . Here the set of states {|j, i } (plus any additional basis states that span the null space for T , if such a space exists) form a distinct path generating basis for T . It should be noted that the converse implication does not hold. That is if U is a power partial isometry, it does not follow that U is distinct path generating in some basis. The reason is that the unitary component of the decomposition may not be distinct path generating in any basis [8]. Distinct path generation does follow if the unitary component of U in the decomposition is either empty or is a bilateral or cyclic shift. The operator D is self adjoint and bounded with eigenstates |j, i . That is D|j, i = Di |j, i = dj,i|j, i where dj,i is a positive real number. For technical reasons it is useful to require that dj,i >  > 0 for all j, i [25]. This avoids such functions as dj,i = 1/j on infinite paths. Note that the operator D accounts for the possible loss of normalization referred to for T . Additional details on U are given in [26,8].
B. Eigenfunctions, Spectrum of H

If T is distinct path generating the eigenfunctions and energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian of Eq. 3 all correspond to one dimensional motion on a path of states in BT . If T = i Ui with D = 1 the motion is free except for the possible presence of infintely high potential walls located adjacent to terminal path states. Details are given in [8]. If no walls ikj are present (path a in Figure 1) the eigenfunctions are given by k =  j=- e |j, i where k is the momentum. The BT path state |j, i is defined at the beginning of section V. The energy eigenvalues are given by E = 2K(1 - cos k) where k can take any value between - and . If one wall is present the eigenstates describe standing waves reflected off the potential wall. For reflection to the left (path b in Figure 1) eigenstates are given by k = b j=- sin k(b - j)|j, i where b is the wall location (T |b - 1, i = 0). For reflection to the right (path c in Figure 1) k =  sin k(j - a)|j, i where a is the wall location j=a (T  |a + 1, i = 0). The eigenvalues are the same as for the free case above. For finite paths (path d in Figure 1) the eigenstates describe bound state motion between two reflecting walls. For the walls located at a and b with a < b the eigenstates are given b-a by k = j=0 sin k(b - a - j)|a + j, i . The energy is given by E = 2K(1 - cos k) where k = 2m/(b - a) with m = 1, 2, · · · , b - a - 1. A similar expression holds for cyclic paths. For the case in which D = 1 finite potentials of different heights and widths can be present in addition to the reflecting walls at path terminal states. The eigenstates and 9

spectra of H are much more complex in that reflections and transmissions occur at the path locations of the potentials [11]. A specific example analyzed elsewhere [12,13,20] showed a complex band structure for the spectrum of H.
C. Sum Over Paths Representation

It is of interest to examine a sum over paths representation of the unitary evolution operator e-iHt to show the relation between the paths defined by iteration of T and T  and those in the path sum. T is assumed to be distinct path generating. The representation is based on a straightforward power series expansion of e-iHt . In the context of this paper, representation as a sum or integral over action weighted paths [27] is not used as it appears to require more development. The time development of the state of a QTM under the action of a Hamiltonian H can be expressed in any basis B by (t) =
b ,bB

|b b |e-iHt |b b|(0) .

(11)

Here (t) and (0) are the system states at times t and 0 and b |e-iHt |b is the amplitude that a QTM in state |b is in state |b after a time interval t. Use of the power series expansion gives b |e-iHt |b = (-it)n  n b |H |b . n! n=0


(12)

Expansion of the matrix element by inserting a complete set of B states between each H factor gives b |H n |b =
b1 ,b2 ,···bn-1

b |H|bn-1 · · · b2 |H|b1 b1 |H|b .

(13)

This is equivalent to a sum over paths p of states in B of length n + 1 that begin with |b and end with |b :


b |H n |b =

p

p(n + 1)|H|p(n) · · · p(3)|H|p(2) p(2)|H|p(1) .

(14)

The prime on the sum means the sum is restricted to length n + 1 paths with the initial and terminal restrictions noted above. The equations hold for arbitrary Hamiltonians H and bases B. If H is given by Eq. 3 and T is distinct path generating in B (i.e. B = BT ) the matrix element b |H n |b = 0 for all n unless |b and |b are in the same T path. T paths are the paths defined earlier by iteration of powers of T and T  on states of BT . If |b and |b are in the same T path, the above shows that b |e-iHt |b is equal to a sum of path amplitudes over paths of all lengths within the T path containing |b and |b . Each path in the sum describes 1-D motion within the T path. This includes motion in both directions with reflections from any terminal states or potentials encountered [12]. 10

D. Effective Determination of Distinct Path Generation

The question can be asked if there is any effective way to determine if a step operator T that satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2 is distinct path generating in some basis BT . That is, does there exist any algorithm or computation which can decide in a finite number of steps for any T that satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2 whether T is or is not distinct path generating? The first step is to note that if T is distinct path generating in the computation basis BC , then this can be decided effectively. To see this note that if T satisfies Eqs. 1 and 2, then, because of space homogeneity, it is sufficient to search through the matrix elements ~ of T with j set at a fixed value, say j = 0. The search involves deciding if each row and ~ column of the matrix for T has at most one nonzero element. Since for fixed j the matrix is finite dimensional, this can be effectively decided provided there is an effective procedure ~ for determining if the matrix elements of T are zero or nonzero. The more general situation in which T is distinct path generating in a basis BT different from BC was examined elsewhere [8]. There it was shown using the operator theoretic description that in general no effective procedure exists. For the matrix description of T one would need to examine the states T n |l, 0, s , (T  )m |l, 0, s for all m, n and all l, s to see if the resulting states can be organized into a basis for which T is distinct path generataing. This procedure is not effective as there are an infinite number of values of n, m. The fact that there is no effective proceedure for general T does not prevent one from studying many examples for which distinct path generation on bases different from BC can be demonstrated. For these examples one method of proving that T is distinct path generating is to prove that T is a power partial isometry or direct sum of shifts. Another method that is sometimes useful is the direct construction of the states in BT . Use of these methods will be seen in the following examples.
VI. EXAMPLES

One goal of studying examples is to show the large diversity of QTMs with step operators T that are distinct path generating for bases BT that are different from BC . All examples discussed here have this property. The second example is chosen to emphasize this property. It also is an example where the activity or sequence of steps carried out on each computation path in the computation basis is different for the different paths. It is a computation of the 2n -1 2n -1 form |0  s=0 cs |s  s=0 cs |f (s) . Here s and s = n s(l)2l-1 denote a length l=1 n binary sequence and the corresponding number. The constant 0 sequence is denoted by 0. The computed function f is the simple one-one function "add 1 mod 2n " where n is arbitrary. Another goal is the study of the structure of the graphs obtained by expansion of the states in the BT paths as superpositions of states in a reference basis such as BC . Many of the graphs for the above example have the form of finite binary trees that may be iterated by appending other trees to the terminal branch lines from the preceeding tree. These graphs have the property that they are open in that they contain no closed loops. The third example (actually two examples) was chosen to illustrate a closed loop graph with one input and one output line. The graph structure of paths of states in BT , when expanded in terms of states in BC , is that of an interferometer in coordinate space. For 11

these examples the emphasis is on the graph structure and not on computation. The first example is very simple with identical activity occurring in the two arms. The second example is slightly more complex in that the activity is different in each of the two arms. However, differences in path states resulting from these activity differences must be removed coherently before the interferometer is closed. This corresponds to bringing the two arms together in coordinate space interferometers. The main purpose of the first example is to show that some step operators have different properties than they appear to have at first glance. For this example the step operator appears to describe an irreversible process of erasure in a string of qubits. However it describes a quite different reversible process for which T is distinct path generating.
A. The Erasure? Operator

Let the step operator T be defined by T = x P1,j + P0,j  uPj . 2 j=-


(15)

The Pauli operator x satisfies x Pi,j = Pi1,j x where i  1 denotes addition mod 2. The operator u is a shift operator for the head on the lattice, uPj = Pj+1 u. No internal head states are needed. Iteration of this operator on a computation basis state moves the head from left to right  on the lattice converting each qubit state |1 to (1/ 2)|0 and leaving |0 alone other than  changing the normalization to (1/ 2)|0 . Thus iteration of T appears at first glance to describe an irreversible erasure along the lattice of qubits changing all 1s to 0 and leaving 0 alone. Appearances are deceiving, though, because T is in fact distinct path generating on a basis BT = BC . This is the reason for the question mark in the subsection title. This can be seen by rewriting T in the form


T =
j=-



2P0,j P+,j uPj .

(16)

This follows from the fact that (1 + x )/2 is the projection operator P+ on the state |+ =  1/ 2(|0 + |1 ). It is straightforward to see that T and T  are power partial isometries [26,8]. This follows from the fact that for each n = 1, 2, · · ·, (T  )n T n and T n (T  )n given by
 n-1

(T  )n T n = T n (T  )n =
j=- k=0  n

P0,j+k Pj P+,j-k Pj
j=- k=1

(17)

are projection operators. Also for each m, n the operators (T  )n T n and T m (T  )m commute [26,8]. 12

The direct sum decomposition of T , Eq. 10 into shifts (as D = 1) contains no unitary components. All paths are either finite or one way infinite from the left. The operators Ui are either a complement of a unilateral shift (a coisometry) or a finite shift. The absence of unilateral shifts or bilateral shifts is a consequence of the 0 state tail condition in the definition of H. The eigenstates and eigenvalues are as described in subsection V B. For the one way infinite path the path states in BT have the form |n, i = |n  n Here |n denotes the head at site n. The state of the lattice qubits n is given by n = |0n b-1 |+ j  |- b  >b . j=n+1 (19) (18)

Here |0n denotes the constant 0 sequence for all lattice sites  n and |± j denotes the  state (1/ 2)(|0 ± |- ) for the site j qubit. The path state |b, i is terminal for T . The value of b is arbitrary. The state >b denotes any state of the qubits at sites > b consistent with the 0 state tail condition. The arbitrariness in >b is possible because the head never enters the lattice region to the right of site b. For finite paths between and including lattice sites a and b, the path states in BT have the same form as in Eq. 18 with a  n  b. The state of the lattice qubits n is given by n = a-2  |1
a-1

 |0[a,n] b-1 |+ j  |- b  b+1 . j=n+1

(20)

Here |0[a,n] denotes the constant 0 state for qubits on sites between a and n, b+1 is as defined before, and a-2 is an arbitrary state of the qubits on lattice sites  a - 2 consistent with the 0 state tail condition. The head never moves outside the lattice region [a, b] as T |b, i = T  |a, i = 0.
B. General Product Qubit Transformation and Add 1

This example is given to show that step operators that are distinct path generating include computations in which linear superpositions of input states each corresponding to a different numerical input are generated. In addition the computation activity, such as the number and actions of the elementary steps, depends on the numerical input. The QTM considered here moves down a string of qubits each in state |0 between two markers carrying out an arbitrary but fixed unitary transformation v on each qubit to generate the lattice qubit state  = j v|0j for all the qubits between the markers. Next the QTM adds 1 mod 2n to each length n state |s in the superposition . For each |s the computation begins with the head moving toward the marker region and ends with the head moving away from the marker region with no further changes in the lattice. The number n is determined by the separation of the two markers. In order to accomodate marker states each qubit is assumed to be a ternary system with a basis |i , i = 0, 1, 2 spanning the Hilbert space of each qubit. In this case the two dimensional unitary operator v is expanded to be the identity when acting on |2 or v  P2  v where P2 is the projection operator for the state |2 . In the following v is assumed to be so expanded. A step operator T that implements this model is the sum of 9 terms. It is given by 13



T =

Q  P u wQ1 P2,j u QvP u wQ0 P2,j u Q0 P0,j u + 2 x,j 1,j + 1 j 0,j + + 5 4 3 2 1 (21)

+

wQ2 x,j P0,j u wQ2 P2,j u QP u wQ3 P2,j u Pj . + + 3 0,j + 6 7 8 9

In the above sum for T Qi with i = 0, 1, 2, 3 is the projection operator for the head in state |i and w shifts the head state by 1 mod 4. That is wQi = Qi+1 w mod 4. The projection operator Pj for the head at site j is at the end of the expression and vj is the expanded unitary operator described above for the site j qubit. The numbers under each term denote the term number for each of the 9 terms. They are present to facilitate discussion of the action of T and T  . T  is given by


T =

(23) (24)

j=-

Since I and F are projection operators T and T  are partial isometries with I and F projection operators on the domain and range space of T . The role of I and F is reversed for T  in that F and I are the respective domain and range space projection operators for T  . The i sums over terms show that only the diagonal terms contribute, that is i j = ij  = 0 if and only if i = j. The action of T can be shown by consideration of an initial lattice qubit state |s with qubits at sites 0 and n+ 1 in the state |2 and in the state |0 at all other sites. Start with an initial state of the form |0, -m, s with the head in state |0 and at position -m. Iteration of T moves the head up to position 0 by the actions of term 1. The state of the head and qubit lattice at this point is shown in Figure 2. Term 2 acts once to give the state |1, 1, s . Term 3 takes over to give the state |1, n + 1 n vj s after n iterations of T . At this point j=0 the lattice qubit state is a linear superposition of n states in the computation basis with 2 the coefficients depending on v. If v = (z + x )/ 2 then the above iteration of T carries out the Hadamard transformation on the n qubits. Note that so far, and in the following, at most one term of T is active at any iteration. This is shown by Eqs. 23 and 24 where only the diagonal terms contribute. In fact T was constructed so that it has this property as it greatly lessens the complication of path determination during iteration of T and T  . The next iteration (term 4) gives the head state |2, n with no change in the lattice qubit state. Terms 5 and 6, which implement the "add 1" operation, now become active. 14

At this point which term is active and the sequence of actions is different for the different components in the superposition of the n qubit states. Iteration of term 5 moves the head back along a string of 1s changing the qubit state |1 to |0 until a qubit in state |0 is encountered. Term 6 then changes the qubit to state |1 , which completes the "add 1" operation in that component state. On all component states in which the site n qubit is in state |0 , term 5 never acts and term 6 acts just once. Note that the site n qubit corresponds to the least significant (units) position with significance increasing as n decreases to 0, the most significant position. At this point the computation is completed. Terms 7,8, and 9 which move the head to the right without stopping and no further qubit state changes, now become active. The final state, when "add 1" is just completed in all components, has the following form:
n

3n+4 =

j=0

[(1 - j,n ) 0|v|0 + j,n ]( 1|v|0 )j (25)

× |0, 3n + 2 - 2j v|01 v|02 · · · v|0n-1-j |1n-j |0n-j+1 · · · |0n |s=[1,n] .

In this state i|v|i is the v matrix element between the qubit states |i , |i where i, i = 0, 1, and |0, 3n + 2 - 2j denotes the head in state |0 at lattice position 3n + 2 - 2j. |s=[1,n] is the state of all qubits not at sites 1, 2, · · · , n. The states of these qubits are unchanged by the action of T or T  . The state 3n+4 is the state obtained by 3n + 4 iterations of T on the initial state |0, 0, s with s given by Figure 2. That is 3n+4 = T 3n+4 |0, 0, s . All 2n components in the computation basis are included even though there are only n + 1 terms in the j-sum. The reason is that each term in the j-sum corresponds to "add 1" to all 2n-1-j components with j consecutive 1s at sites n, n - 1, · · · , n - j + 1 and a 0 at site n - j. (For j = n 2n-1-j = 1.) It is of interest to schematically expand the states along the computation path as superpositions of states in BC . To this end let the state m denote the path state obtained by m iterations of T or T  on the state |0, 0, s . That is m = T m |0, 0, s if m  0  -m (T ) |0, 0, s if m < 0 (26)

The expansion of m as a superposition of states in BC for increasing m shows an initial line branching into an n stage binary tree (generated by n iterations of term 3 in Eq. 21) with each of the 2n lines continuing. This is shown in Figure 3 which shows the tree development by successive iterations of T starting from the initial state shown in Figure 2. The above construction can be extended to initial lattice qubit states with more than two qubits in state |2 . For example let |s be such that qubits at sites 0, n1 , n2 , n3 with 0 < n1 < n2 < n3 are in states |2 and are in state |0 everywhere else. Let the number of |0 state sites between the |2 sites be given by n = n1 - 1, p = n2 - 1 - n1 , m = n3 - 1 - n2 . In this case the structure of T is such that "add 1" is carried out on the n and m qubits in the first and third regions. Iteration of T for states where the head is in the second region of p qubits just moves the head along with no changes in the head or lattice qubit state until the head arrives at site n2 . Note that in Eq. 25 the head position is different in each of the n components in the j sum. As a result the iteration number or arrival time for the head at n2 is different for each of the n components. 15

The final states with the head to the right of n3 describe the completed "add 1" in both regions. The structure of the final state corresponding to Eq. 25 is complex as it contains a double sum j,k with j = 0, 1, · · · , n and k = 0, 1, · · · , m. Also the head position is different for each term in the sum as it depends on both j and k. Each component in the double sum is a product of lattice qubit states of the form given in Eq. 25 for j = j and for j = k. For j = k the lattice qubit state describes the qubits in the region between sites n2 and n3 . Adjustments in qubit state indices that label the qubit location and for the possibility that m = n must be made. Details are left to the reader. Expansion of the final states as superpositions of states in BC gives a double binary tree structure with a binary tree of m stages attached to each terminal branch of an n stage tree. The length of the line (corresponding to the number of T iterations) between the last branching in the first tree and the beginning of branching in the second tree depends on the lattice distance n2 - n1 and to which component in the j sum of Eq. 25 a particular branch corresponds. The structure can be visualized by attaching an m stage binary tree like that shown in Figure 3 to each of the 2n output paths of the tree shown in the figure. The second tree would begin about n2 - n1 path states from the solid triangles shown in the output paths. For initial lattice qubit states with an even number 2h of qubits in state |2 with regions of 0s in between the above attachment of binary trees to the end branches of a preceeding tree is iterated h times. The lengths of the lines betweeen the last branching of the kth tree and the beginning of the k + 1st tree for k = 1, 2, · · · h - 1 follow a pattern similar to that described above for the two trees h = 1. The terminal tree structure is different for initial qubit states that contain an odd number of qubits in state |2 . to see this it is sufficient to consider the case with the site 0 qubit the only one in state |2 and all other qubits in state |0 . In this case only the first three terms of T are active. Iteration of T moves the head in state |1 to the right without stopping. As it moves it converts each qubit from state |0 to v|0 . Expansion of the path states in terms of the basis BC shows a nonterminating binary tree. The branching begins when term 3 of Eq. 21 becomes and remains permanently active. For initial states with an odd number 2h + 1 of qubits in state |2 separated by regions of 0s. There are h iterations of finite stage binary trees attached as described above for the even number of 2s in the initial state. In addition a nonterminating binary tree is attached to each terminal branch of the last (hth) tree in the iteration. It remains to discuss the proof that T and T  are distinct path generating. This is done by considering the path states m defined above in Eq. 26. One has to show that for each m  0 iteration of T  on m does not generate new states. That is for each n < 0 (T  )-n m = m+n . Also for each m < 0 and each n > 0 T n m = m+n . The critical step in the proof is to note that T  , acting on the state 0|v|0 |3, j +1 |1j + 1|v|0 |2, j -1 |0j , gives (terms 5 , 6 active) the state |2, j v|0j . Irrelevant parts of the state have been excluded for clarity. Additional details are left to the reader. It is clear that this proof applies to initial states containing arbitrary distributions of 0s and 2s in the qubit state lattice and to arbitrary positions of the head in any one of the four internal states. For all of these states T is a direct sum of countable many copies of the bilateral shift and the restriction of T to these subspaces is unitary. The proof is easily extended to cover initial states with one or more qubits in state |1 . 16

Thus it is clear that T is distinct path generating in that it is a direct sum of copies of finite shifts, unilateral shifts, complements of unilateral shifts, and bilateral shifts.
C. QTMS with Interferometer Graph Structures

The above example shows that the restriction of T to be distinct path generating is sufficiently powerful to include quantum computations that generate branchings in BC where the specific computation steps in each branch are different. The graph structure for a large number in intial lattice qubit states was seen to be that of iterated binary trees with or without a nonterminating terminal tree. Here two examples of QTMs are given for which some paths in BT correspond to graphs in BC that have the structure of interferometers. It is of interest to note that use of coordinate space interferometers to factor integers has been described [28]. For the first example let T be given as an l, s sum, Eq. 5, by


T =

[Q0 P0,j + wQ0 P1,j + (Q1 + Q2 )P0,j + Q0 w  P1,j ]uPj
j=-

(27)

Here w is a unitary operator that takes the head state |0 into the linear superposition  (1/ 2)(|1 + |2 ) of head states |1 and |2 . It is this linear superposition that creates the two branches of the interferometer. The interferometer is opened when the second term of T is active and closed when the last (righthand) term is active. It is straightforward to prove that T is a power partial isometry with all types of noncyclic paths present in the decomposition into shifts. Note that any state of the form |, j, s where   is the head state (1/ 2)(|1 - |2 and the site j qubit is in state |1 is a terminal BT path state for T . Iteration of T on any state of the form |0, j, s where j < 1 and |s has the form shown at the top of Figure 4, moves the head to the right until the state |1 qubit is encountered at site 1. The next iteration opens the interferometer with the two branches labelled by different head states.  Continued iteration of T describes head motion along the lattice with the head in state (1/ 2)(|1 + |2 ). This state, which is a coherent sum of 2 BC states, describes the two arms of the interferometer. The interferometer is closed when the second qubit in state |1 at site n is encountered. The bottom of Figure 4 shows the interferometer where paths of connected dots refer to paths of states in BC . The branches labelled with 2 and 1 correspond to the two head states |2 and |1 . Note that the positions of opening and closing of the interferometer correspond to the lattice positions of the qubit in state |1 . This occurs because all terms of T show the head moving in the same direction. This example is a very simple QTM in which the action in both branches of the interferometer is identical and no changes in the qubit lattice occur. The two arms are distinguished by different head states only. It is of interest to see if there exist QTMs for which different activities occur in the two arms and for which the step operators are distinct path generating. The answer is that such QTMs exist provided activities in each arm are such that all differences in the computation states in the two arms generated by iteration of T are removed at the step prior to coherent combination or closure of the arms. Also this must hold for all initial states. 17

An example of such a QTM is given by the following operator with 9 terms:


T =
j=-

w 2 Q3 P1,j u w 2 Q2 P0,j u Q0 P0,j u w Q P u w 2Q1 vP0,j u + + + 12 0 1,j + 4 5 3 1 2 (28)

+

w 2 Q4 P1,j u w 2 Q5 P0,j v  u w 2 Q6 P0,j u Q (w  ) P u Pj + + + 0 78 1,j 6 7 8 9

As before the term numbers are placed below the terms. Terms 3, 5, and 7 are active in one arm and terms 4, 6, and 8 are active in the other arm of the interferometer. Terms 2 and 9 open and close the interferometer. There are 9 different head states with w the unitary shift shift operator on the head    states defined by wQh = Qh+1 w mod 9. The two unitary operators w12 , w78 satisfy w12 |0 =    1/ 2(|1 + |2 ) and w78 |0 = 1/ 7(|1 + |8 ). The two dimensional unitary operator v is arbitrary, and the head shift operator u is as defined in other examples. The interferometer is opened by the action of term 2 where the head in state |0 is  converted to state 1/ 2(|1 + |2 ). Terms 3,5,and 7 are active in succession in the arm with head state |1 , and terms 4,6, and 8 are active in succession in the arm with head state |2 . The interferometer is closed by the action of term 9. Each arm of the interferometer is a path containing just 4 states. This is a consequence of the fact that, except for the first term, each term of T in an iteration is active just once. This follows from the presence and properties of the head state change operators present in each term except the first. The activities in the two arms are different because of the presence of v and v  in terms 3 and 7 but not in 4 and 6. Thus the middle two states in the arms differ by both the head states and the qubit states on which terms 3 and 5, and 4 and 6 act. These differences are shown in Figure 5 which shows explicitly the computation basis states in the interferometer arms for an initial state given by |0, 0 |11, 02 , 13 |0else . This state has the head in state |0 at lattice site 0 and the qubit lattice state with 0s everywhere except at sites 1 and 3. The states of the qubits at sites 1, 2, 3 are shown explicitly. The production of interferometers described above can be iterated by suitable choice of initial lattice qubit states. For example a string of n interferometers is generated for the initial state |0, 0, s where |s contains n repetitions of the pattern |1j , 0j+1, 1j+2 for j > 0 with each repetition separated by one or more 0s. It is straight forward to prove that T is distinct path generating with all types of shifts present. One way to do this is to show that iteration of T  on T n  for various n and different initial states does not generate new states (i.e. (T  )m T n  = T n-m  for m  n. Because of the structure of the terms of T it is sufficient to show this for values of n = 0, 1, · · · 7 for suitably chosen states. The same demonstration is also needed for iterations in which the roles of T and T  are interchanged. As noted for this example the head motion is exactly the same for both arms of the interferometer. That is terms 3 and 4 move the head one site to the right. Terms 5,6,7, and 8 all move the head one site to the left. It is of interest to see what happens if this synchrony of head motion in the arms is broken. An example would be to change the definition of T by exchanging u and u in terms 4 and 6. In this case it is easy to show that the altered T is not distinct path generating. The reason is that under the alteration term 6 scans a different qubit in state |1 than does term 4. It is then easy to see that iteration of T on initial states of the form |0, 0 |1j |0=j for j > 0 generates terminal states in both arms of 18

the interferometer. However the path in the arm in which the altered term 6 is active is shorter than the path in the arm in which term 5 is active. Iteration of T  on any state representing just one arm of the interferometer will not regenerate the initial state. This example illustrates the fact that there are step operators T that are distinct path generating on some subspace of H even if they are not distinct path generating on the whole space. The above example showed states on which T is not distinct path generating. However this altered T is distinct path generating on lattice qubit states of the form |1j , 0j+1 , 1j+2 and 0 everywhere else with the head in state |0, h with h < j. Besides these states there are many other types of initial states on which T is distinct path generating.

A simple model for atom optical elements for Bose condensate of trapped, dilute alkali atoms is proposed and numerical simulations are presented to illustrate its characteristics. We demonstrate ways of focusing and splitting the condensate by modifying experimentally adjustable parameters. We show that there are at least two ways of implementing atom optical elements: one may modulate the interatomic scattering length in space, or alternatively, use a sinusoidal, externally applied potential.

I. INTRODUCTION

Since the first experimental realisation of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) with dilute, trapped alkali gases in 1995 [1­3], rapid progress has been made in studying their physical properties. One of the exciting prospects for BEC from the outset has been the possibility of realising the matter equivalent of optical laser, i.e. the atom laser [4,5]. The recent demonstration by the MIT group of an output coupler for condensates [6] along with the interference of two independent condensates [7] has brought the realisation of the atom laser one step closer. In fact, one could argue that we already have a rudimentary atom laser and that we should be looking for effective ways to control the output beam of such sources. By control we mean focusing and beam splitting of flowing condensates, in analogy to conventional optics using light. In the last few years, there has been tremendous progress made in the field of atom optics, both linear and non-linear, in which the motion of atoms is controlled via light forces [8­13]. Direct application of these techniques using light forces will not always be possible due to a variety of factors. These include the possible heating of the condensate by the laser field which may destroy the condensation. Ideally one wants to apply light fields to transfer momentum to the atoms in a controlled manner while keeping the atom assembly condensed. This is, of course, a particularly severe task for ultracold BEC's. In this paper we apply the well-known idea of optically generated potentials used in atom optics in the context of Gross-Pitevskii Equation (GPE) to model how the atom optical elements produce focusing and splitting of a condensate. We should emphasise that we shall be demonstrating the effect of such arrangements rather than providing detailed descriptions of how such a configuration would be constructed in practice. We shall, however, discuss some of what we see as the main limitations of such schemes. In section II we shall specify our theoretical model and in section III the results of our simulation are presented. Finally, these results are discussed in view of available experimental parameters, in section IV.
II. MODEL A. The NLSE or Gross-Pitaevskii Equation

The mean-field theory for an assembly of condensed atoms in an external field may be obtained in two ways: in the first, we start with the non-linear atom optics point of view of many-body wave function and then find an appropriate limit for Bose condensation; in the second, we use a field theory approach of Ginzburg and Landau [14] which is the standard approach in much of the literature on Bose condensates. The mean field theory obtained from these two approaches is identical, and we shall briefly outline only the second route below. For a detailed discussion of formalism of nonlinear atom optics, readers are referred to papers by Lenz et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [11­13]. The Hamiltonian for a system of interacting atoms in a trap is given by: ^ H= 1 ^ ^ ^  (r, t)H0 (r, t)d3 r + 2 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^  (r , t) (r, t)V (r, r )(r , t)(r, t), (1)

^ where H0 is the single particle Hamiltonian

h ¯ ^ H0 = - 2 + Vtrap (r), 2m r ^ and the field operator  obeys the standard boson commutation relation ^ ^ [(r),  (r )] = (r - r ).

(3)

We shall assume, given the fact that we are dealing with a dilute gas, that the interatomic potential can be approximated by that of contact interaction: ^ V (r, r ) = V(r - r ), Additionally, we shall suppose that, V  Vintrinsic + Vinduced. (5) (4)

That is to say, the strength of the overall interatomic interaction may be viewed as the sum of that due to intrinsic interactions and the modification due to an external influence such as that of the laser, magnetic field or rf-induced interaction. Such externally induced modification may occur, for example, when pairs of atoms, driven by the external field, have the ground state mixed with an electronically excited quasimolecular state. This quasimolecular state can have much stronger interaction, modifying the scattering amplitude in the process. Description of the interaction strength is facilitated by introducing the scattering length a, which is proportional to V. The nonlinear Schr¨dinger o equation for the condensate wave function, , is then given by: i¯ h where Cn = 4N ¯ 2 h (aintrinsic + ainduced) m 4N ¯ 2 a h = , m (7) (8) h ¯2 2  = -  + Vtrap (r) + Cn ||2 , t 2m r (6)

with N being the number of particles in the sample, and m the mass of a single particle. aintrinsic denotes the scattering length in the absence of an external field and is an experimentally measurable quantity; ainduced is that induced by an external electromagnetic field for which there are various theoretical predictions. It is predicted, for example, that the overall scattering length, a, may be varied by the application of a magnetic field for F = 3, mF = -3 hyperfine state in Cs [15]. A blue detuned "optical shielding" type laser of variable intensity [16,17] is also believed to be a good way to achieve control over the effective scattering length. Experimental measurement of an ainduced, however, has not been performed to date. We note here that, in theory, the non-linear coefficient, Cn may be made position dependent, since the induced scattering length, ainduced, may be varied in space with an application of a laser field with a suitable variation in intensity. The nonlinear Schr¨dinger equation or the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation, Eq. (6), describes the dynamics of a single o atom moving in the presence of mean field induced by other atoms in the system, in addition to the effects of the confining trap potential. The GPE has been found, over the last couple of years, to provide very good description of condensate behaviour over a range of temperatures from near T = 0 K to a sizeable fraction of T /Tc where Tc is the critical temperature of phase transition [18­21].
B. Modified GPE

We intend to investigate two types of possible experimental arrangement. As the first possibility, we consider a typical atom optical configuration as shown schematically in Fig 1: Firstly the condensate is prepared in a trap and released so that it freely falls under gravity. Such a situation is described by turning the trap off i.e. setting Vtrap = 0. The cloud of atoms will undergo ballistic expansion. The condensate is then passed through an interaction region in which it is subject to an interaction potential, before it again falls freely in space onto a detector or a surface. We look at two types of interaction with this set up: spatial modulation of the scattering length in the interaction region, so that the corresponding evolution is given by: 2

i¯ h

 h ¯2 2 = -  + C(cos k · r + D)||2 , t 2m r

(9)

and use of sinusoidal potential in the interaction region as described by: i¯ h  h ¯2 2 = -  + A cos k · r + Cn ||2 , t 2m r (10)

where C and A are the amplitudes and k the wave number which can be adjusted. We present the results for the case when D = 0, and also the case when the sinusoidal variation is limited to positive scattering lengths, by a suitable adjustment of D. Using either method, the atomic motion may be modified in a controllable manner. The two methods are, however, qualitatively different since the first involving Cn is of an intrinsic nature, which arises from interaction of atoms in a many body system while the second involves imposing an external potential. We shall see that unlike conventional atom optics, we now have two avenues to impose potential gradient, which may or may not be applied simultaneously and opens up the possibility of manipulating the relative amplitudes and phases of these two potentials. In this way, it seems possible to generate an effective overall potential gradient, which may even vary over time, to tailor our atom optical component. As the second possible experimental arrangement, we look at the effect of spatially varying the interatomic scattering length in the presence of the confining trap. The condensate is not dropped, and therefore we can study the case in which one has both types of potentials present simultaneously. This is modelled by an equation with a minor modification to the standard GPE: i¯ h  h ¯2 2 = -  + Vtrap (r) + f (r)||2 . t 2m r (11)

We consider the case of f (r) = Gr2 as well as f (r) = C(cos k · r + D), where G, C, D are constants, in order to test general features of such an arrangement. The condensate formed recently at MIT using the cloverleaf trap configuration was reported to have an aspect ratio of 20 [22]. This means that a 1 dimensional GPE may be expected to provide an adequate qualitative description of the evolution of a cross section of such condensate. The spatial modulation of Cn discussed above would, in this case, be along the long axis. To be more precise, one may allow some Gaussian spreading of Cn in the radial direction of the cigar-shaped condensate. i.e. Cn (r)radial of the form Cn (r)radial  e-rradial .
2

(12)

We assume the coupling between the Cn (r)axial and Cn (r)radial to be weak. The 1D GPE with modified linear and non-linear potentials was integrated using a 4th order Runge-Kutta integration routine over various configuration times in order to find the optimal condition for focusing and splitting. In the following we assume that all our atoms originally have positive scattering lengths.
III. RESULTS A. Results for the atom optical configuration

In order to simulate the experiment of type shown in Fig. 1, we need to specify how long we let the condensate to free fall, interact with the chosen field and then fall freely again onto a detector or a substrate. It was found from simulations that, once the initial free evolution time is chosen, the final spatial distribution of the condensate that we see at the detector depends, as would be expected, quite sensitively on the duration of interaction and the subsequent free fall. In our simulations, we chose a reasonable initial free fall time and then selected the interaction and the subsequent free fall times so as to give optimum probability distribution in terms of sharpness and regularity of the peaks on the final detector.
1. Spatial modulation Cn in the interaction region

In conventional atom optics, parabolic optical potentials are used to provide a focussing effect. We have, therefore, tried a parabolic modulation of Cn in the interaction region. It was found that, in order to see any noticeable focusing 3

effect by such an arrangement, we need a very steep position dependence, such that around the tail region of the condensate, Cn of the order of around 20 times the original value is needed. A theoretical treatment by Fedichev et al. [23] indicates that although it might be possible to change the scattering length by comparable amounts, the accompanying inelastic scattering rate also undergoes a correspondingly large increase. Since this is not experimentally favourable, we do not pursue the parabolic variation any further and instead concentrate on the sinusoidal modulation of Cn in the interaction region. We have let our condensate to ballistically expand for t = 1/ to model the initial free fall part of Fig. 1. The axial trap frequency of the MIT cloverleaf trap was reported to be  = 2 × 18 Hz which translates t to time of order 27 ms. Figure 2 shows in solid line the probability distribution immediately after the interaction region, interacting for duration t = 0.3/ with modulation amplitude C = Cn , D = 0 and wave number k = 2 in harmonic oscillator units. The dashed line indicates the ballistically expanded condensate just before the interaction. This interaction time, which corresponds to approximately 8 ms in the MIT trap parameters, gave the best result in terms of sharpness, height and regularity of the peaks. The shape of the spatial modulation is shown as the dotted line. We see that the number of peaks and valleys match the number of spikes in the condensate as to be expected from conventional potential gradient idea. Indeed, it was found that in an identical simulation with k = 1 i.e. half the wave number, we get 4 prominent spikes in the final distribution instead of 8 as seen here. It is then reasonable to expect that the sharpness of these peaks, as indicated by the ratio of their height to widths would increase if the amplitude of the potential was increased; the results agree with this prediction. The maximum peak height of 0.094 for Fig. 2 was increased to 0.162 as a result of doubling the amplitude of modulation while keeping the general shape. After the interaction region, the condensate was let to evolve freely. Figure 3 shows the final probability distribution after the distribution shown in Fig. 2 was freely evolved for duration t = 0.3/. The time of free evolution was again chosen so as to give the best distribution. The peaks are now broader and have been displaced so that now there is a peak at the origin, as a result of rather complex dynamical motion of various parts of the condensate as it expands. The dotted lines represent the shape of the effective potential that was originally in place in the interaction region. It was found that a regular probability distribution is again restored after t = 0.8/, with shorter and broader peaks. The case of a sinusoidal variation of the scattering length which remains positive was also investigated. This was simply accomplished by translating the potential vertically so that the minimum value of Cn is now 0 instead of -Cn as in the previous case. The final result is shown in Fig. 4. The solid line is the case when Cn varies from 0 to Cn . The dot-dashed line indicate the case when Cn varies from 0 to 2Cn . We see that there is no qualitative difference from the previous case in which negative scattering length was allowed; the amplitude of modulation seems to be the determining factor rather than the sign. The effect of longer initial free evolution time than 1/ was to give shorter peaks, but with the same general shape and width. This can be explained from the fact that after a longer free fall, the condensate has spread out more and its peak height is consequently shorter when it interacts with fields in the interaction region.
2. Using a sinusoidal potential in the interaction region

In a direct analogue to the case of spatial modulation of Cn , we try and simulate the same experiment of Fig. 1, but here we employ a sinusoidal potential in the interaction region while leaving Cn spatially invariant i.e. Eq. (10). The initial free fall time was again chosen to be 1/. The probability distribution immediately after the interaction region of Fig. 1 for a sinusoidal potential is shown as solid line in Fig. 5. In this case, Eq. (10) was integrated with A = 1 and k = 2 over interaction time t = 0.2/. As before, the shape of the sinusoidal potential is shown in dotted line, and the dashed line indicates the ballistically expanded condensate immediately before the interaction. When the amplitude of modulation was doubled, the maximum peak height of 0.073 shown in Fig. 5 was found to increase to 0.102 while keeping the same general shape. Again, when an initial free evolution time longer than 1/ was considered, shorter peaks were produced, giving smaller peak height-to-width ratio, as discussed previously. The final probability distribution after a subsequent free evolution of duration t = 0.3/ is shown as solid line in Fig. 6. It was again found that a regular probability distribution is restored after t = 0.9/, with shorter and broader peaks. When one uses A = 2 in the sinusoidal potential, the corresponding probability distribution is as given by the dot-dash line in Fig. 6. For this case, free evolution time after the interaction of 0.4/ was used. We see here that the effect of modifying the confining trap potential is qualitatively the same as that of modulating Cn and that their effect in both cases may be understood by simply using the potential gradient idea, as in conventional atom optics. We note also that parabolic potential over the interaction region is another possible configuration for focusing. It was found, however, that although focusing effect does arise in the sense of counteracting the ballistic expansion, its

4

effectiveness was rather small and broadening took place on a very short time scale after leaving the interaction region. This is possibly because by this stage, repulsive interactions dominate in a dynamically expanding condensate, such that the original trap potential is not sufficient to counteract the expansion. Again a very steep parabolic potential was needed to observe an efficient focusing effect.

B. Spatial modulation of Cn in the presence of a trap

In this subsection, we look at the possibility of imposing both the spatial modulation of Cn and a confining trap. We look at the evolution such as that described by Eq. (11), which, in addition to the atom optical configuration discussed in the previous subsection, is another possible experimental arrangement. Since, in this case, the confining trap prevents ballistic expansion, a parabolic variation in Cn with more realistic values of the scattering length could be studied. Figure 7 displays the probability distribution of the original trapped condensate in solid line while the dot-dash line displays the distribution with a parabolic variation on the non linear coefficient in Eq. (11). This is the result after time t = 0.5/ where  is the trap frequency. In this simulation we assumed that Cn varies as Cn x2 /400 in harmonic oscillator units so that we have Cn (x) = 0 at the origin and Cn at x = ±20. We see here a focusing effect within the trap. The height, and consequently the width, of the peak was found to vary over time in an oscillatory fashion. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the maximum height of the peak over time in the presence of this parabolic potential. The behaviour can be qualitatively understood from the fact that the condensate on the "wings" of the gaussian-like initial distribution `feels' a push towards the center, resulting in the build up of the peak height; the peak height then starts to decrease after a maximum as the condensate pass through each other and results in broadening of the base of the distribution. A slowly-varying beating type envelope appears on the oscillatory curve when a different parabolic distribution is used; for instance when the Cn varies as Cn x2 /100 rather than Cn x2 /400. This slowly-varying beat pattern is caused by effective phase difference between the potentials acting on the condensate. In this example, the potentials act as two distinct "springs" which are out of phase with one another in time; this effect becomes more pronounced when the tightness of the parabolic potential due to Cn is changed. The resulting probability distribution when a sinusoidal rather than a parabolic variation of scattering length is imposed is shown in Fig. 9. We see that an action similar to beam splitting occurs with two prominent peaks. The time of interaction shown is t = 0.4/. Again there is a time dependent behaviour as to be expected. The somewhat unexpected shape of Fig. 9 can be explained by superposing the two independent potentials; Fig. 10 shows the shape of the overall potential when the parabolic trapping potential and the sinusoidal one modulating the non-linear constant is superposed. (This is a plot of x vs. x2 /4 + Cn cos x.) It is clear from the shape that the most likely probability distribution is that of two peaks, as any further peaks would require additional energy. Again, the time-dependent variation of the probability distribution can be explained by the fact that, as the condensate changes its shape over time, both the trapping potential and the sinusoidal potential from the nonlinearity exert time-varying forces. It is noted that in Fig. 9, we used k = 1 modulation, and the separation between the two peaks was reduced for higher k, as to be expected. When the trap was turned off, it showed a lot more peaks than the expected number of around 4 (c.f. Figs. 4-6). This is readily seen to be the effect of the trapping potential; there is an extra force from the sides toward the center, resulting in high number of peaks in the main region x = -10 . . . 10. What is clear from simulations of this subsection is that we can manipulate the shape of an intially stationary condensate within a trap by modulating the non-linearity constant.

IV. DISCUSSION

In this section we attempt to estimate possible experimental values. First of all, we note that the interaction times used in simulations of the order of 10 ms are very much within the limits of present technology, since a typical atom lithography set up has the total time taken from a thermal source to substrate of the order 0.67 ms [9]. It is also noted that typical time of flight of the condensate used in recent experiments before imaging is around 40 ms, so the total time taken from source to detector in our numerical simulations matches those of real experiment very closely. The total distance the condensate falls in our example from source to detector is, then, around 1 cm. The width of each peak in simulations is around 2 harmonic oscillator units which, for sodium atoms and the cloverleaf trap, corresponds to approximately 7 µm. Possible ways to reduce this width even further would be by using the modulating field of higher value of amplitude to k ratio in the interaction region and also by using a trap of higher frequency than 2 × 18 Hz. The effect of increasing k alone would mean the peaks become more closely spaced.

5

The area under each peak was such that the number of atoms in each peak would be around 10% of total number of atoms. A very important point is whether there is any limit to the number of atoms in each peak due to interactions between the particles. This aspect was investigated by looking at the probability distributions for the case where we employ sinusoidal potential, i.e. Eq. (10), but with various values of interatomic interaction strength characterised by Cn . It was indeed found that the "fringe visibility" defined as V = Pmax - Pmin , Pmax + Pmin (13)

where Pmax and Pmin represent the maximum and the minimum of the "fringe pattern" decreases quite dramatically when we use a larger value of Cn . As an approximate indication, simulation with Cn = 150, as compared to Cn = 20 used in Figs 5 and 6 gives V = 0.24 as compared to original V = 0.72. The times used were 0.5/, 0.2/, and 0.3/. The initial free evolution time was chosen to be t = 0.5/ rather than 1/ because in this case of large Cn , the cloud spreads out too much by the time t = 1/. Noting that Cn is also proportional to N , the total number of the condensate particles, this brings us to the question of whether production of an intense beam of atoms in an atom laser is a requirement when atom optical elements of this kind is used. This aspect seems to be an important limiting factor in the design and implentation of any atom optical experiment using bose condensates. One may, in principle, use a higher value of A for high values of Cn to improve the visibility. This implies that to be effective, various parameters have to be adjusted carefully to optimise the set up for each instance. Modulation of scattering length and use of sinusoidally varying potential raise the issue of experimental feasibility, as these will certainly involve interaction of an electromagnetic field with ultracold atoms. The primary effect of light on cold trapped atoms is to cause loss processes by giving atoms enough energy to escape the trap, through such processes as photon recoil and photoassociation. The rate at which an atom heats up as a result of photon recoil is given by =  
2

(14)

where  is the natural atomic linewidth,  the Rabi frequency and  the detuning. It is assumed here that ||   and ||  . A recent theoretical study by Fedichev et al. shows that it is, in fact, possible to alter the scattering length by as much as 350% for 7 Li and minimize recoil or photoassociation losses with a selection of frequency detuning and Rabi frequency [23]. In order to have small recoil losses along with a significant change of a it is necessary that the detuning,  be large and negative, and chosen to be not too far from a vibrational resonance with one of the bound p states of the electronically excited quasimolecule. All our simulations depend on the assumption that the possible heating of the condensate is either negligible, or has typical time scale which is long compared to the interaction times considered here. We also note that generation of optical potentials by Raman transition has recently been proposed as a way to reduce the spontaneous emission rate [24]. The atom optical elements discussed in this paper may be achieved via magnetic as well as optical fields, and it is conceivable that certain arrangement such as, say, an optical shielding laser combined with a magnetic field-induced potential gradient might provide a solution. More study, however, would be required on exactly how one can implement these atom optical elements. In summary, it was found from numerical simulations involving various configurations that focusing and splitting effects can be achieved within the context of the non-linear Schr¨dinger equation with modified potentials. It is pointed o out that our simulations just show a possible theoretical model, without inclusion of such effects as the spontaneous emission of atoms as might be the case when the external potential involves an optical dipole force. Various possible improvements may be made in order to accommodate such effects into theory. For example the effect of inelastic collisions may be incorporated by letting Cn be complex. However, at present, there is no clear indication of how big such effects will be in practice. Further studies along the lines of atom optics could involve the study of coherence property of the condensate which have been modified in this way. Other possibilities include finding a way to use the two potentials simultaneously to tailor an atom optical element of an arbitrary specification, and eventually finding a way to prepare vortex states in the condensate through such modification. This will then be of relevance to the study of superfluidity in trapped alkali bose gas, and in this sense, the atom optical elements would be more than just equivalents of conventional optical elements.

Unusual light spectra from a two-level atom in squeezed vacuum

Abstract We investigate the interaction of an atom with a multi-channel squeezed vacuum. It turns out that the light coming out in a particular channel can have anomalous spectral properties, among them asymmetry of the spectrum, absence of the central peak as well as central hole burning for particular parameters. As an example plane-wave squeezing is considered. In this case the above phenomena can occur for the light spectra in certain directions. In the total spectrum these phenomena are washed out.

Introduction

The interaction of squeezed light with atoms has found considerable theoretical attention in the last years. As pointed out in the seminal paper of Gardiner [1], squeezed light, either in the white noise limit or broadband colored noise [2], can drastically alter the radiative properties of atoms and can, in principle, reduce substantially the spectral linewidth of emitted light. Gardiner's paper has stimulated a large amount of work on the interaction of squeezed light with atoms. We refer to the detailed review of Parkins [3] for references and an account of work up to 1993. For more recent work see, e.g., Refs. [4, 5] and references therein. Gardiner [1, 6] considered a one-dimensional like situation in which only a single channel is squeezed and where the atom couples only to this channel. Here a channel means a set of modes ranging over all frequencies with the remaining quantum numbers characterizing the modes kept fixed [1]. For example, a channel may consist of all modes with fixed angular momentum and parity for a multipole expansion of the field, or of all plane wave modes with a given direction and polarization. 1

An investigation of resonance fluorescence spectra of atoms interacting with a (single-channel) squeezed vacuum plus a laser was initiated by Carmichael, Lane, and Walls [7] (for further references see the review [3] and Refs. [4, 5]). Smart and Swain [8, 9] have pointed out the existence of interesting structures in these spectra. In Ref. [11, 10] multi-channel squeezing and associated correlation functions for three-level atoms were studied. In this paper we consider the spectral effects of a multi-channel squeezed vacuum in the white noise limit on a two-level atom. For the atomic correlation functions and the total spectrum of all outcoming light a multi-channel squeezed vacuum leads to analogous results as a single-channel squeezed vacuum with appropriate parameters. However, in a multi-channel situation one can observe not only the total spectrum but also the light spectrum in individual channels. It turns out that -- due to interference of the (quantized) light scattered from the atom with the squeezed vacuum -- these spectra can show unexpected features which are not visible in the total spectrum, e.g., a possible asymmetry, absence of the central peak as well as central hole burning for particular parameters. By the same arguments as in Ref. [2] we expect these features to persist also for only approximate white-noise squeezing. In Section 2 below the general case of multi-channel squeezed white noise interacting with a two-level atom is treated. The spectrum is calculated in terms of a background, scattered, and interference part. In Section 3 we treat in detail an example in which the channels consist of plane waves with fixed directions and polarizations. In this case one has a divergence of the background term when calculated in terms of photon numbers, and we therefore use the spectral Poynting vector to calculate the spectrum for given position and direction of observation of the spectral analyzer. In this case the above phenomena like asymmetry, central hole burning etc. can occur for the light spectra in certain directions. In Section 4 we discuss our results in detail, in particular the question of interference, and point out a possible connection, probably more formal than directly physical, with the results of Ref. [9].

Spectra for general multi-channel squeezing

We consider a two-level atom coupled to the electromagnetic field in threedimensional space. The free Hamiltonians of the atom and the field are given by  HA = h0  +  - ¯ HF = d h a ()a () , ¯  (1)
0 

where 0 denotes the atomic transition frequency,  + = |+ -| and  - = |- +| are the atomic raising and lowering operators and the a () are the annihilation

operators of the field obeying the commutation relations [a1 (1 ), a 2 (2 )] = 1 2 (1 - 2 ) .  (2)

The index  stands for all quantum numbers of the chosen modes apart from their frequency and thus characterizes a channel. These are, for example, parity and angular momentum quantum numbers if the multipole expansion of the field is used, or the direction of propagation together with the polarization for plane wave modes. In the rotating-wave approximation, the interaction Hamiltonian may be written as i¯ h HAF =  2

In general, for such a state the second order moments of the b () read in the white noise limit [12, 6] b (s)b (t) = M (s - t) with If one omits factors of the form [ ()/(0 )]1/2 this leads to a (1 )a (2 ) a (1 )a (2 )  MT = M N = N M M = N (N + 1) .

One can imagine a state of this kind as being produced by independently squeezing modes with different , e.g., by coupling them to different parametric oscillators [13]. For a pure state, as considered here, the assumption (11) seems not to be very restrictive. See [14, 15], where for a finite number of modes the question is discussed to what extent second order moments can be simplified by choosing appropriate modes. The fluorescence spectrum of an atom illuminated by squeezed white noise has been studied by Gardiner [1] and has since become textbook material [6]. In Gardiner's article and in a large part of the following work it was supposed that initially only a single channel of the radiation field is squeezed and that the atom couples only to this channel. In our notation, this means there is a particular ,  = 0, say, with M = M,0 N = N,0  = ,0 .

for the moments of the a (). In the following Eq. (8) will be used as definition of squeezed white noise. We shall assume in the following that M and N are diagonal for the given modes, M =  M N =  N . (11)

(12)

Such a situation will, a little imprecisely, be called one-dimensional in the following. We now want to calculate the spectrum S () that would be observed by a spectral analyzer coupled to the modes (, ) with  fixed. (For plane wave modes this would simply be the spectrum of light with a certain polarization observed in a certain direction.) One could of course also observe and determine other spectra, e.g., the spectrum in a channel which is a superposition of different 's. Our procedure easily carries over to this situation. To determine S () we shall adapt the procedure of Gardiner [1, 6] to multi-channel squeezing. At a finite time the spectrum is proportional to the expectation value of the photon number operator a ()a (). The stationary spectrum is given by  S () = lim 1 T  2T

where  denotes the Heaviside function, and in particular (21)

Inserting this into Eq. (13) yields a decomposition of the spectrum into three parts, corresponding to the correlation functions

as expected for the spectrum of white noise. Although  = 1, it has explicitly been kept since it becomes divergent if the index  is not purely discrete, e.g., for plane wave modes. For such modes, a state with M, N being diagonal is an idealization just as a plane wave coherent state. It will be shown in the next section how this problem can be bypassed in a simple physical way. I The `mixed' correlation function w (t1 , t2 ) can be reduced to an expression ± containing only the atomic operators t by means of the formulae

which can be derived in a similar way as in the one-dimensional case. The remaining correlation functions of the  ± can be evaluated in the stationary limit using the quantum regression theorem and the atomic master equation. 5

Since the calculations for the one-dimensional case in [6] can be carried over, except for some obvious modifications, we just give the results.

(27)

The possible values of M and N are restricted by the inequality |M|2  N(N + 1) , (28)

which follows from the relations |M |2 = N (N + 1) [cf. Eq. (9)]. In the one-dimensional case , M, and N defined above agree with those appearing in Eq. (12), and for pure states -- which we have been considering above -- the equality sign would hold in Eq. (28). The full range of the parameters M and N can also be realized in this case if one uses mixed states. By absorbing a phase into the atomic states if necessary, M can be chosen S, real and positive. With this convention one gets for   0 (the relation w I ( ) = S, w I (- ) yields the corresponding expressions for  < 0)

an expression that coincides with the spectrum in the one-dimensional case. This shows that, as long as only this kind of spectrum is observed, all states satisfying (11) are equivalent to mixed states of the one-dimensional type (12); c.f. the remark following Eq. (28). In contrast to S(), S () shows new features, namely in general the spectra are asymmetric and the sign and the relative weight of the peaks depend on M and N . The asymmetries are caused by the phase of M (this phase has a physical meaning as it is the relative phase of M and M) since the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of S (0 +   ) are the Fourier transforms of the real and imaginary part of w ( ), respectively. In figure 1 the spectrum (33) is plotted for N = N and increasing values of  = arg M . For  = 0 one obtains the spectrum of the one-dimensional case consisting of two Lorentzians, a positive narrow peak of width - and a negative broad peak of width + . For 0 <  <  the spectrum is asymmetric with respect to 0 , the asymmetry being maximal for  = /2. The relative weights of the symmetric contributions to the spectrum decrease and vanish for  = /2. For /2 <   , the weights increase again but the signs of the two Lorentzians are interchanged. The spectra for     2 coincide with those for 2 -  mirrored at  = 0 . For N = 0 (and consequently M = 0) the background and interference parts of the spectra vanish. As the scattered part does not depend an N and M , the spectra take the shape of the dotted line in figure 1 (the dashed line now representing S = 0). Spectra for N > N are plotted in figure 2. As compared to those with N = N, the positive peaks are attenuated while the depth of the negative peaks increases.

Example: Squeezed plane waves

To be more specific, we shall now deal with plane wave modes in greater detail. These modes are specified by their wave-vector k and their polarization  = 1, 2, ^ ^ i.e., by  = ck and  = (k, ) with k = k/k. In the dipole and rotating-wave approximation the interaction Hamiltonian is given by HAF = -d · E(-)  - - d · E(+)  + , (35)

Note that their phases do not depend on . As already noted, a squeezed state with M, N being diagonal for plane waves leads to a divergent expression in Eq. (23). One could try to circumvent this problem by subtracting the divergent background part, but a physically more satisfactory solution is to use an improved definition of the spectrum which avoids divergences automatically. A suitable quantity for modeling the spectrum actually observed in an experiment is the spectrally resolved energy flux through a (small) surface A centered at r = r0 , SA,r0 () = d · S(r, ) , (42)
(A, r0 )

where the operator S(r, ) represents the `spectral Poynting vector', i.e., the spectral energy flux density. More realistically, one could also use a direction-sensitive spectral analyzer, e.g., an analyzer admitting only directions in a certain cone in k space, such that only radiation with directions from this cone is observed. It can be shown that, as physically expected, the scattered and interference parts of the spectrum are not influenced by this as long as the cone contains the line between the atom and the detector. For the background part the directional ^ selection would simply result in a restriction of the integration over k in Eq. (54) below to this cone. For the operator S(r, ) we shall use the expression (cf. [16]) S(r, ) = lim

(59) shows that, as far as the interference and scattered parts are concerned, the spectrum in Eqs. (62) ­ (64) is a sum of spectra for fixed polarization. The latter correspond to a spectrum for fixed  as in Section 2 and can be ob^ r tained by omitting the sum over  in Eq. (64) and replacing the factor 1 - |d ·^0 |2 ^ in Eq. (63). by |^0 , · d| r The basic features of the spectra are the same as in the general case of Section 2. This will now be discussed in more detail.

Discussion

The spectra in Eq. (33), as well as those in Eqs. (62) ­ (64), are a sum of a background term S B , a scattered part S S and a term S I , which can be identified as an interference part. That this term is indeed due to interference (note that all radiation is quantized) can be seen in various ways. Formally, this is already suggested by Eqs. (21) and (22). The last term in Eq. (21) is due to the presence of the atom since it vanishes for  = 0 and Eq. (22) is due to the cross terms of this with b [21]. The interference nature of S I becomes yet more transparent if one uses the spectral Poynting vector for the calculation of the spectrum, as in Section 3. As pointed out there, the results for S S and S I remain the same for a directionsensitive spectral analyzer, as long as the analyzer points in the direction of the atom. If the direction-sensitive analyzer does not point in this direction one shows by the same arguments as in Section 3 that S S and S I become zero. This is physically expected since it means that the corresponding light originates at the site of the atom. Furthermore, if the vacuum is squeezed only for directions ^ in some cone C, i.e., if Nk, and Mk, vanish for k not in C, then S I vanishes if ^ ^ the direction ^0 from atom to analyzer is not in the squeezing cone C, since then r N^0 , and M^0 , in Eq. (64) vanish. Moreover, S I depends on Nk, and Mk, only ^ ^ r r ^ r for k = ^0 [except for the general dependence of N and M in Eq. (61)], and this can be interpreted as the fact that scattered light interferes only with incident light traveling in the same direction, just as for classical light scattering. This can be traced back to Eq. (55). The spectra in Eqs. (62) ­ (64) depend on the direction ^0 of the analyzer. As r seen from Eq. (63), outside the squeezing cone the spectrum consists of a narrow Lorentzian sitting on top of a broad Lorentzian. This is a special case of the 12

dependence on  in Eq. (33). As remarked earlier there is no interference outside the squeezing cone. The analogous fact is true in the general case, as seen in I Eq. (30) for S which vanishes when the channel  is not squeezed. For multi-channel squeezing one has more parameters available than in the single-channel case. In addition to N and M of the single-channel case one now also has N and M (or Nk, and Mk, in the plane-wave model), with ^ ^ |M |2 = N (N + 1). The range of M and N is restricted by the inequality (28), |M|2  N(N + 1) , (65)

where the equality sign holds, as easily shown, if and only if N  N and M  M for all  with  = 0. Only in this case does the spectrum S () in Eq. (33) contain a peak which becomes increasingly narrow for increasing N as seen from the definition of - in Eq. (31) which for constant ratio m  M[N(N + 1)]-1/2 can be written as - = (N + 1 )(1 - m) + 2 m + O N -2 8N .

For m = 1 this not only recovers the one-dimensional like case of Gardiner [1] with its interesting narrow peak [22], but also shows that a subnatural linewidth and the above new features are mutually exclusive. A similar situation is found in Ref. [5] for single-channel squeezing with an additional laser. If the equality does not hold in Eq. (65), then - increases with increasing N and the corresponding peak cannot become arbitrarily narrow. But as long as M 2 /[N(N +1)] is not to small (the spectra in figure 1 and 2 belong to M 2 /[N(N + 1)] = 0.75), there are other interesting features in this case. First of all, if M is real then the spectrum is symmetric. However, if M is complex (since we have chosen M as positive this actually means M /M complex) then Im M = 0 and the spectrum is asymmetric. But even if M is real, new phenomena occur, as seen in figure 1 and 2 for  = 0. In this case the negative contribution can substantially exceed the positive one in absolute value, as shown in figure 2 ( = 0), and for negative M /M the central maximum can be absent completely. The same is true in Eqs. (63) and (64) for the plane wave model. If M /M is complex then the last term in Eq. (33), which comes from the interference part, makes the spectrum asymmetric. For the plane-wave model this is seen in Eq. (64). This asymmetry is a new phenomenon which does not occur in the one-dimensional case. Various typical spectra are shown in figure 1 and 2. It seems that the relative phases of M and M play a similar role for the spectra as the introduction of an additional laser with a relative phase in the onechannel case, which has been investigated in Refs. [8, 9]. The spectra obtained in Ref. [9] resemble those in our figures. The similarity is particularly striking for figure 3 [23]. Spectra with a `pimple' and central hole burning occur also 13

in Ref. [9], and we have a similar sensitivity of this effect on the parameters (in figure 3 the `pimple' disappears for  = 0, corresponding to the cancellation of the contributions from the scattered and interference part, respectively). It seems to us, however, that this is more a formal mathematical similarity of two physically distinct situations since in both cases one has sums and differences of Lorentzians and the possibility to adjust various parameters. Physically, the spectra calculated in Ref. [9] belong solely to the scattered light from the atom, which is driven by the combined field of the laser and the squeezed vacuum, and therefore these spectra correspond to detection directions away from the driving fields. In our case, however, these spectra result from the interference of the radiation emitted by the atom with the squeezed light traveling away from the atom, and in these directions the combined light is spectrally analyzed. In summary, we have shown that in the case of an atom in a more general squeezed vacuum the spectrum can show new phenomena compared to the onedimensional like case, among them absence of the positive peak and asymmetry. In the plane-wave model the shape of the spectrum can become direction dependent which, in the general case, is translated into  dependence. This dependence is due to an interference effect of the squeezed light with the scattered light.
